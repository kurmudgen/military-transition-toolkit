## Understanding TBI VA Disability Ratings

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is brain damage caused by external force such as blast waves, impacts, penetrating injuries, or acceleration/deceleration forces. TBI is one of the signature injuries of Iraq and Afghanistan wars but affects veterans from all eras.

The VA rates TBI under 38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045 (brain disease due to trauma), using a unique rating system based on 10 facets of functioning.

### What is Traumatic Brain Injury?

TBI occurs when external force causes brain dysfunction. Severity ranges from mild (concussion) to severe (coma, permanent disability).

**Severity Levels:**

**Mild TBI (Concussion) - 80-90% of military TBI:**
- Loss of consciousness (LOC): 0-30 minutes
- Alteration of consciousness: Up to 24 hours
- Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA): 0-1 day
- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 13-15

**Moderate TBI:**
- LOC: 30 minutes to 24 hours
- PTA: 1-7 days
- GCS: 9-12

**Severe TBI:**
- LOC: >24 hours
- PTA: >7 days
- GCS: 3-8

**Penetrating TBI:**
- Object penetrates skull and brain tissue
- Gunshot wounds, shrapnel, fragments

### Common Causes in Military Service

- **Blast exposure:** IEDs, mortars, rockets, RPGs (blast wave causes brain injury even without direct impact)
- **Vehicle accidents:** Rollovers, crashes, IED strikes
- **Falls:** Parachute accidents, falls from vehicles, training accidents
- **Direct impact:** Struck by objects, vehicle accidents, training injuries
- **Combat injuries:** Gunshot wounds, shrapnel
- **Training accidents:** Sports injuries, combatives, obstacle courses

**Important:** Even mild TBI (concussion) without loss of consciousness can cause permanent symptoms and qualify for VA disability.

## VA Rating Criteria for TBI

The VA uses a unique 10-facet rating system for TBI residuals. Rating is based on severity of symptoms across these facets, NOT on initial injury severity.

### The 10 Facets of TBI

The VA evaluates residual symptoms in 10 areas:

1. **Memory, attention, concentration, executive functions** (cognitive)
2. **Judgment** (decision-making ability)
3. **Social interaction** (relationships, social appropriateness)
4. **Orientation** (time, place, person)
5. **Motor activity** (coordination, movement)
6. **Visual spatial orientation** (navigation, spatial awareness)
7. **Subjective symptoms** (headaches, dizziness, fatigue, sensitivity to light/sound)
8. **Neurobehavioral effects** (irritability, impulsivity, emotional regulation)
9. **Communication** (speech, language, expression)
10. **Consciousness** (altered states, seizures)

### Rating Levels

The VA assigns a severity level to each affected facet:
- **Level 0:** No symptoms
- **Level 1:** Mild symptoms
- **Level 2:** Moderate symptoms
- **Level 3:** Severe symptoms
- **Level 4:** Total impairment

**The overall TBI rating is based on the highest level of severity across all facets:**

## Evidence Requirements for TBI Claims

### 1. In-Service Traumatic Event

You must document that a head injury or traumatic event occurred during military service:

**Medical Records:**
- Service treatment records documenting head injury
- Medical evacuation records
- Emergency room visits
- Neurology consultations during service
- Brain imaging (CT, MRI) from service

**If No Medical Records:**
- **Incident reports:** Unit reports of IED attacks, vehicle accidents, etc.
- **Deployment records:** Showing service in areas with blast exposure
- **Buddy statements:** Fellow service members describing traumatic event
- **Personal statement:** Detailed description of traumatic event(s)

**Common In-Service Events:**
- IED blast exposure (document date, location, symptoms)
- Vehicle rollover or crash
- Fall from height (parachute accident, vehicle, building)
- Direct impact to head (struck by object, vehicle accident)
- Gunshot wound or shrapnel
- Sports injury during service
- Training accident

**For Blast Exposure:**
Even without loss of consciousness or immediate medical treatment, blast exposure can cause TBI. Document:
- Proximity to blast
- Whether you were knocked down or thrown
- Immediate symptoms (dazed, confused, ears ringing, headache, nausea)
- Delayed symptoms (headaches, memory problems, irritability in days/weeks after)

### 2. Current TBI Diagnosis and Residual Symptoms

**Diagnostic Evaluations:**
- **Neurological examination** by neurologist
- **Neuropsychological testing** (cognitive function assessment)
- **Brain imaging** (MRI, CT) - may show structural damage but often normal in mild TBI
- **TBI screening tools** (VA TBI Clinical Reminder)

**Residual Symptom Documentation:**
- Cognitive symptoms: Memory problems, concentration difficulties, executive function deficits
- Physical symptoms: Headaches, dizziness, balance problems, vision changes
- Emotional/behavioral: Irritability, mood swings, impulsivity, depression, anxiety
- Sleep disturbances
- Sensory sensitivities (light, sound, smell)

**Cognitive Testing:**
Neuropsychological evaluation assesses:
- Memory (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Attention and concentration
- Processing speed
- Executive functions (planning, organizing, problem-solving)
- Language and communication
- Visual-spatial skills

Results compared to age/education norms to identify deficits.

### 3. Nexus (Link Between TBI and Current Symptoms)

**Medical Nexus Opinion:**
Neurologist or neuropsychologist should provide opinion that current symptoms are "at least as likely as not" related to in-service TBI.

**Nexus Statement Example:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's current cognitive deficits (impaired memory, concentration, and executive function) are residuals of the traumatic brain injury sustained during blast exposure in Iraq in 2008. Neuropsychological testing demonstrates objective deficits consistent with TBI residuals. The veteran's symptoms began during or shortly after military service and have persisted, supporting a causal relationship."

### 4. Evidence of Functional Impairment

**To support higher ratings (40%-100%), provide evidence of functional impact:**

**Employment:**
- Termination letters citing performance or cognitive problems
- Performance reviews showing decline
- Job accommodations (reduced hours, simpler tasks, written instructions)
- Inability to maintain employment
- Vocational rehabilitation records

**Daily Living:**
- Statements describing difficulty with household tasks (cooking, cleaning, bills, shopping)
- Need for reminders and assistance
- Getting lost or disoriented
- Difficulty managing finances
- Safety concerns (leaving stove on, forgetting medications)

**Social/Relationships:**
- Divorce or relationship breakdown
- Social isolation and withdrawal
- Loss of friendships
- Family statements describing personality changes
- Inappropriate social behavior

**Medical Treatment:**
- Frequency of neurology/psychiatry appointments
- Medications for headaches, seizures, mood, sleep
- Therapy (cognitive rehabilitation, speech therapy, occupational therapy)
- Hospitalizations for TBI complications

**Cognitive Deficits:**
- Neuropsychological test results showing objective impairment
- Use of compensatory strategies (lists, alarms, calendars)
- Difficulty learning new information
- Need for instructions in writing or repeated

## C&P Exam for TBI

### What to Expect

**Exam Type:** TBI-specific C&P exam (may include multiple components)

**Examiners:** Physician (neurologist, psychiatrist, or trained examiner)

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes (longer than most C&P exams due to complexity)

**Exam Components:**
1. **Medical history review** (traumatic event, symptoms, treatment)

5. **Evaluation of 10 TBI facets**
6. **Functional capacity assessment**
7. **Review of available imaging and testing**
8. **Completion of TBI DBQ**

**Note:** The C&P exam may NOT include full neuropsychological testing. Bring your own neuropsych test results if available.

### What the Examiner Will Ask

**About the Traumatic Event:**
- When and where did the head injury occur?
- What happened? (Blast, impact, fall, vehicle accident)
- Did you lose consciousness? For how long?
- Were you dazed, confused, or disoriented?
- Did you have amnesia for events before or after?
- What were immediate symptoms? (Headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion)
- Did you receive medical treatment? Where and when?
- Were you medically evacuated?

**Communication:**
- Do you have difficulty finding words?
- Do you have speech problems?

**Sensory:**
- Are you sensitive to light, sound, or smells?
- Do you have vision problems?
- Do you have hearing problems or ringing in ears?

### How to Prepare

**Before Exam:**
- Gather all medical records from traumatic event (service treatment records, ER records, imaging)
- Obtain neuropsychological testing if not already done
- Bring brain imaging results (MRI, CT)
- List all current symptoms organized by the 10 facets
- Document functional impact (how symptoms affect work, daily life, relationships)
- Obtain buddy statements from family describing cognitive and behavioral changes
- Bring list of all treatments tried (medications, therapies, specialists)

**During Exam:**

**DO:**
- Describe traumatic event in detail (date, location, what happened, immediate symptoms)
- Describe your **worst symptoms**, not average days
- Provide specific examples of cognitive difficulties (forgetting appointments, getting lost, needing reminders)
- Explain functional impact on work, relationships, daily activities
- Mention all residual symptoms (headaches, dizziness, irritability, sleep problems, memory issues)
- Describe how symptoms have affected your life (job loss, divorce, social isolation)
- Bring medical records and test results to support your statements

**DON'T:**
- Minimize symptoms to appear "normal" or "capable"
- Say you're "fine" or "managing well" if you're struggling
- Perform better on cognitive tests than you typically function (exam anxiety can sometimes improve performance temporarily)
- Forget to mention important symptoms or functional impacts
- Exaggerate (be honest—objective tests will reveal truth)

**Key Points to Make:**

**For 10% Rating:**
- "I have mild memory problems and occasional headaches from my TBI"
- "I can work but I need extra time and have to write everything down"

**For 40% Rating:**
- "I have moderate memory and concentration problems that significantly affect my work"
- "I have frequent severe headaches (X times per week)"
- "I've had job performance issues because I forget important tasks or have difficulty organizing"
- "I've withdrawn from social activities and my relationships are strained"

**For 70% Rating:**
- "I have severe memory problems—I forget recent conversations and family members' names"
- "I cannot maintain employment due to cognitive deficits"
- "I get lost driving to familiar places"
- "I have severe headaches daily"
- "I require constant reminders and supervision for daily tasks"
- "I've been unable to work since my TBI"

## TBI Residuals: Separate Ratings for Secondary Conditions

**Critical Point:** TBI residuals (symptoms caused by TBI) can be rated SEPARATELY from the TBI itself, significantly increasing total compensation.

### Common TBI Residuals Rated Separately

#### 1. Migraine Headaches

**Most common TBI residual.** Headaches from TBI are rated separately under DC 8100.

**Ratings:** 0%, 10%, 30%, or 50%
- **50%:** Prostrating headaches occurring weekly or less often
- **30%:** Characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month

**Evidence:**
- Headache diary documenting frequency, severity, duration
- Treatment records (medications, neurology visits)
- Nexus: Headaches caused by TBI

**This alone can add 30-50% to your rating.**

#### 2. Tinnitus

**Common after blast-related TBI.**

**Rating:** 10% (capped)

**Evidence:**
- Audiogram documenting tinnitus
- Nexus: Tinnitus caused by blast TBI

#### 3. Hearing Loss

**Rating:** 0-100% based on audiometric testing

**Evidence:**
- Audiogram showing hearing thresholds
- Nexus: Hearing loss from blast TBI

#### 4. PTSD or Mental Health Conditions

**TBI and PTSD commonly co-occur after blast exposure or combat trauma.**

**Ratings:** 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%

**Note:** Mental health symptoms may be rated under TBI (neurobehavioral facet) OR separately as PTSD/depression. VA will assign whichever is more favorable.

**Evidence:**
- PTSD diagnosis and treatment records
- Combat stressor documentation
- Can be rated separately if clearly distinct from TBI neurobehavioral symptoms

#### 5. Vertigo and Balance Disorders

**Rating:** 10%, 30%, 60%, or 100% (under DC 6204)
- **30%:** Dizziness with occasional staggering
- **60%:** Dizziness with staggering occurring more than once a week

**Evidence:**
- Vestibular testing
- Documentation of falls or balance problems
- Nexus: Vertigo caused by TBI

#### 6. Vision Problems

**TBI can cause:**
- Double vision (diplopia)
- Blurred vision
- Visual field defects
- Eye movement disorders

**Ratings:** Vary by specific condition

**Evidence:**
- Ophthalmology or neuro-ophthalmology evaluation
- Visual field testing
- Nexus: Vision problems caused by TBI

#### 7. Seizure Disorder

**Post-traumatic seizures can develop after moderate-severe TBI.**

**Ratings:** 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100%
- **20%:** At least 1 major seizure in last 2 years; or at least 2 minor seizures in last 6 months
- **40%:** At least 1 major seizure in last 6 months
- **80%:** More than 1 major seizure per month on average

**Evidence:**
- EEG showing seizure activity
- Neurology records documenting seizures
- Anti-seizure medication use
- Nexus: Seizures caused by TBI

#### 8. Sleep Disorders

**TBI commonly causes insomnia and other sleep problems.**

**Usually rated under mental health condition, but sleep apnea can be rated separately at 30-50%.**

**Evidence:**
- Sleep study
- Sleep medication use
- Nexus: Sleep disorder caused by TBI

#### 9. Cognitive Disorder

**If cognitive symptoms from TBI are significant, they may be rated separately as "Dementia due to head trauma" (DC 9304).**

**Ratings:** 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%

**Evidence:**
- Neuropsychological testing showing significant cognitive impairment
- Functional impact on work and daily living

---

## Combined Ratings Example: TBI with Residuals

**Veteran with blast TBI:**

- **TBI (residuals):** 40%
- **Migraines (TBI residual):** 50%
- **Tinnitus (TBI residual):** 10%
- **PTSD (separate from TBI):** 70%

**Combined Rating Calculation:**
- Start with highest: 70% (PTSD)
- Add 50% (migraines): 70% + (30% of 50%) = 70% + 15% = 85%
- Add 40% (TBI): 85% + (15% of 40%) = 85% + 6% = 91%
- Add 10% (tinnitus): 91% + (9% of 10%) = 91% + 0.9% = 91.9%
- **Rounds to 92%, which rounds to 90%**

**Monthly Compensation:** $2,297.96 (90% rate)

If this veteran also has physical injuries (back, knee, etc.), they could easily reach 100%.

---

## Success Stories

### Case Study 1: Blast TBI with Multiple Residuals

**Veteran:** Army infantryman, multiple IED blasts Afghanistan 2010
**Initial Rating:** TBI 10%, tinnitus 10% (2012)
**Issue:** Worsening headaches, cognitive problems, unable to maintain employment

**Evidence for Increase (filed 2018):**
- Neuropsychological testing showing moderate cognitive deficits
- Headache diary: 4-5 prostrating migraines per week
- Termination letters from 3 jobs (2014-2017) citing performance issues
- Spouse statement describing severe personality changes, irritability, memory problems
- Neurology records documenting treatment-resistant migraines

**New Ratings (2019):**
- TBI residuals: Increased to 70%
- Migraines (TBI residual): 50% (NEW)
- Tinnitus: 10% (unchanged)
- Combined: **90%**

**Monthly increase:** From $346.95 (20%) to $2,297.96 (90%) = **$1,951.01/month**

**Retroactive pay:** From filing date (2018) to decision (2019) = $23,412

**Key Lesson:** File for increases when symptoms worsen. Separately rate TBI residuals like migraines for maximum compensation.

---

### Case Study 2: TDIU for TBI

**Veteran:** Marine Corps, TBI from vehicle rollover Iraq 2006
**Ratings:**
- TBI residuals: 40%
- Migraines (TBI residual): 30%
- PTSD: 50%
- Combined: 80%

**Issue:** Unable to maintain employment due to cognitive deficits and headaches

**TDIU Filed:** 2017

**Evidence:**
- Employment history: 6 jobs in 8 years, all ending in termination or resignation due to performance issues
- Vocational expert opinion: TBI cognitive deficits preclude substantial gainful employment
- Neuropsychologist statement: Severe memory and executive function deficits incompatible with competitive employment
- Employer statements describing frequent absences due to migraines, difficulty following instructions, safety concerns

**Result:** TDIU granted
**Compensation:** Receives 100% rate ($3,831.30/month) despite 80% rating

**Key Lesson:** If you cannot work due to TBI and residuals, file for TDIU even if your rating is below 100%.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get disability for mild TBI (concussion)?

Yes. Even mild TBI without loss of consciousness can cause permanent residual symptoms qualifying for VA disability. The VA rates based on current symptoms, not initial injury severity.

### What if I don't remember the traumatic event?

Post-traumatic amnesia (memory loss for the event) is actually evidence of TBI. Use other evidence:
- Buddy statements from those who witnessed event
- Medical evacuation records
- Unit incident reports
- Service treatment records showing head injury

### Can TBI be service-connected years after discharge?

Yes. TBI must have occurred during service, but you can file for benefits at any time. Many veterans don't realize cognitive or headache problems are TBI residuals until years later.

**Provide:**
- Evidence of in-service head injury (even if minor at the time)
- Nexus opinion linking current symptoms to in-service TBI
- Evidence symptoms began during or shortly after service

### Do I need brain imaging to prove TBI?

No. Brain imaging (MRI, CT) is often **normal** in mild TBI. TBI is diagnosed based on:
- History of traumatic event
- Clinical symptoms
- Cognitive testing
- Neurological examination

Normal imaging does NOT rule out TBI or residual symptoms.

### Should TBI and PTSD be rated separately?

It depends. If you have both TBI and PTSD from the same event (e.g., blast exposure), the VA may:
- Rate mental health symptoms under PTSD
- Rate cognitive and physical symptoms under TBI
- OR combine all symptoms under one diagnosis

**The VA should choose whichever approach gives you the higher rating.**

If symptoms are clearly distinct (TBI from vehicle accident, PTSD from combat), they should be rated separately.

### How do I prove I was in a blast even without medical records?

**Evidence:**
- Unit records showing IED attacks on specific dates
- Deployment records showing service in combat zone
- Awards (Combat Infantryman Badge, Combat Action Ribbon)
- Buddy statements from fellow service members
- Personal statement describing blast events
- After-action reports

Combat veterans have a lower burden of proof—VA must give benefit of the doubt.

### Can I get more than 10% for TBI?

Yes. If you have residual symptoms causing functional impairment, you should be rated 40% or higher. The 10% rating is for mild symptoms with minimal impact.

**For 40%+:** Provide neuropsychological testing, employment records showing cognitive difficulties, and evidence of moderate functional impairment.

### Will the VA reduce my TBI rating?

TBI ratings are generally **stable** because brain injuries rarely improve significantly. However:
- VA may schedule reexamination in first 5 years
- After 5 years, rating is "stabilized" and harder to reduce
- After 20 years, rating is "protected"

If proposed reduction occurs, submit evidence of ongoing symptoms and functional impairment.

## Conclusion

Traumatic Brain Injury is one of the signature injuries of modern warfare, affecting hundreds of thousands of veterans. While TBI itself may be rated 10-70%, the residual symptoms (migraines, cognitive problems, PTSD, vertigo, etc.) can be rated separately, significantly increasing total compensation.

**Key Takeaways:**
- TBI rated 0%, 10%, 40%, 70%, or 100% based on 10 facets of functioning
- Mild TBI (concussion) can cause permanent symptoms qualifying for disability
- Normal brain imaging does NOT rule out TBI residuals
- **Migraine headaches from TBI should be rated separately (30-50%)**
- TBI and PTSD commonly co-occur after blast exposure
- Neuropsychological testing provides objective evidence of cognitive deficits
- File for TDIU if unable to work due to TBI
- Combined ratings with residuals can reach 90-100%

Don't accept a low rating for TBI. The cognitive, emotional, and physical impacts can be devastating—fight for full compensation for all residual symptoms.
