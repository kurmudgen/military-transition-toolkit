## VA Rating Criteria

**DC 5237 - Lumbosacral Strain**
**DC 5242 - Degenerative Arthritis**
**DC 5243 - Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS)**

### Range of Motion Based Ratings:

**Normal Lumbar ROM:**
- Forward flexion: 90°
- Extension: 30°
- Left/Right lateral flexion: 30° each
- Left/Right rotation: 30° each

**10%:** Forward flexion greater than 60° but not greater than 85°, OR combined ROM greater than 120° but not greater than 235°

**20%:** Forward flexion 30°-60°, OR combined ROM 120° or less, OR muscle spasm/guarding on exam

**40%:** Forward flexion 0°-30°

**50%:** Unfavorable ankylosis (fusion in poor position)

**100%:** Unfavorable ankylosis entire spine

### Incapacitating Episodes (IVDS):

**40%:** Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during past 12 months

**50%:** Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during past 12 months

**60%:** Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 8 weeks but less than 10 weeks during past 12 months

**100%:** Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 10 weeks during past 12 months, or more

**Incapacitating Episode Defined:**
- Requiring bed rest prescribed by physician
- Unable to work or perform activities of daily living

## Common Lumbar Conditions

### 1. Lumbar Strain/Sprain
Muscle or ligament injury causing pain and ROM limitation.

**Rating:** Based on ROM limitation (10%-40% typically)

### 2. Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)
Wear-and-tear degeneration of spinal discs.

**Rating:** Based on ROM limitation, typically 10%-40%

**Evidence:** MRI showing disc degeneration, height loss, desiccation

### 3. Herniated Disc (Bulging Disc)
Disc material protruding beyond normal boundaries, potentially compressing nerves.

**Rating:**
- ROM based: 10%-40%
- Incapacitating episodes: 40%-100%
- Radiculopathy (separate rating): 10%-60%

**Evidence:** MRI showing herniation, nerve root compression

### 4. Sciatica/Radiculopathy (Rated Separately)
Nerve pain radiating down leg from spinal nerve compression.

**DC 8520 (Sciatic Nerve Paralysis):**
- **10%:** Mild incomplete paralysis
- **20%:** Moderate incomplete paralysis
- **40%:** Moderately severe incomplete paralysis
- **60%:** Severe incomplete paralysis

**Combined:** Back 20% + Sciatica 40% = 52% → **60%** combined

### 5. Spinal Stenosis
Narrowing of spinal canal compressing nerves.

**Rating:** ROM based OR incapacitating episodes

**Evidence:** MRI/CT showing stenosis

### 6. Spondylolisthesis
Vertebra slipping forward over the one below.

**Rating:** ROM based OR incapacitating episodes

**Evidence:** X-ray showing vertebral slippage

---

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. ROM Measurements
Must be from healthcare provider using goniometer or inclinometer.

**Critical:** Measurements should reflect worst functional ROM during flare-ups, not best day ROM.

### 2. Imaging
- **X-rays:** Show arthritis, alignment, fractures
- **MRI/CT:** Show disc herniations, stenosis, nerve compression

### 3. Functional Limitations
- Difficulty bending, lifting
- Cannot sit/stand for long periods
- Cannot walk long distances
- Use of assistive devices (cane, walker)
- Inability to perform work duties
- Difficulty with ADLs (dressing, bathing, household tasks)

### 4. Incapacitating Episodes Documentation
For IVDS ratings (40%-100%):
- **Physician prescribed bed rest**
- Medical records during episodes
- Work excuse notes
- Hospitalizations or ER visits

**Track all episodes:**
- Dates
- Duration (days unable to work)
- Symptoms (severe pain, unable to walk, bed rest)
- Treatment (medications, injections, ER visits)

---

## Service Connection

**Direct:**
- Injury during service
- Service treatment records
- Continuity of symptoms

**Common In-Service Events:**
- Heavy lifting
- Parachute jumps/landings
- Vehicle accidents/rollovers
- Rucking (carrying heavy packs)
- Physical training injuries
- Blast exposure

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing back condition worsened by service

**Secondary:**
- Back problems from compensating for leg injury
- Back strain from altered gait

---

## C&P Exam Tips

**DO:**
- Bring all imaging and medical records
- Describe worst pain/limitations
- Demonstrate actual limited ROM (don't force beyond functional ability)
- Mention pain during ROM testing
- Describe incapacitating episodes (dates, duration)
- Note flare-ups after use

**DON'T:**
- Try to perform better than typical function
- Minimize pain
- Forget to mention radiculopathy/sciatica if present
- Fail to document incapacitating episodes

---

## Secondary Conditions

### 1. Radiculopathy/Sciatica
**Connection:** Spinal nerve compression from herniated disc or stenosis

**Rating:** 10%-60% (separate from back rating)

### 2. Hip Arthritis
**Connection:** Altered gait from back pain causes hip stress

**Nexus:** Back injury → altered mechanics → hip arthritis

### 3. Depression
**Connection:** Chronic back pain causes depression

**Rating:** 0%-100%

## Success Story

**Veteran:** Army infantryman
**Initial:** Lumbar strain 10% (ROM limited to 80° flexion) - 2010

**Worsening:**
- MRI 2016: L4-L5 herniation
- Developed sciatica down right leg
- Multiple incapacitating episodes

**Increase Claim 2017:**
- Lumbar ROM: 40° flexion (40% ROM rating)
- 5 incapacitating episodes totaling 7 weeks in past year (50% IVDS rating)
- **VA assigned higher:** 50% for back
- Sciatica (moderate incomplete paralysis): 20% (separate)

**Combined:** Back 50% + Sciatica 20% = 60%
**Monthly:** $1,395.93

## FAQ

**Q: Can I get both ROM and incapacitating episode ratings?**
A: VA assigns whichever is higher, not both for the same condition. However, if you have both herniated disc AND arthritis, you might get ROM for arthritis and incapacitating for disc.

**Q: What if my ROM varies?**
A: VA should consider typical function and flare-ups. Document ROM during flare-ups.

**Q: Can sciatica be rated separately?**
A: Yes. Back rated under spinal DC, sciatica/radiculopathy rated under peripheral nerve DC 8520.

**Q: How do I prove incapacitating episodes?**
A: Physician notes prescribing bed rest, work excuse notes, ER records, statements from employer/family.

## Conclusion

Back pain is one of the most disabling conditions for veterans. Ratings from 10%-100% based on ROM limitation, incapacitating episodes, or combination. File for secondary radiculopathy and hip/knee conditions for maximum compensation.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ROM measurements critical
- Incapacitating episodes can yield 40%-100%
- Radiculopathy rated separately
- Secondary hip/knee conditions common
- Don't minimize limitations during C&P
