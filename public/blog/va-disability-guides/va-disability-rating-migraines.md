## Understanding Migraine VA Disability Ratings

Migraines are severe, debilitating headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, and sound sensitivity. They are one of the most commonly service-connected conditions among veterans, frequently occurring as residuals of TBI, PTSD, or as secondary conditions to other service-connected disabilities.

The VA rates migraines under 38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100 (migraine headaches).

### What Are Migraines?

Migraines are neurological attacks characterized by:

**Primary Symptoms:**
- Intense throbbing or pulsing pain (usually one-sided but can be bilateral)
- Moderate to severe intensity
- Worsened by physical activity
- Duration: 4-72 hours if untreated

**Associated Symptoms:**
- **Nausea and/or vomiting**
- **Photophobia** (light sensitivity)
- **Phonophobia** (sound sensitivity)
- **Osmophobia** (smell sensitivity)
- Visual disturbances (aura)
- Dizziness or vertigo
- Difficulty concentrating (brain fog)
- Fatigue

**Migraine Phases:**
1. **Prodrome:** Warning signs (hours to days before): mood changes, neck stiffness, food cravings, frequent yawning
2. **Aura** (in 25% of migraineurs): Visual disturbances (flashing lights, blind spots, zigzag lines), sensory changes, speech difficulties
3. **Headache:** Severe pain with associated symptoms
4. **Postdrome:** "Migraine hangover" after attack: fatigue, difficulty concentrating, mood changes

### Types of Migraines

**Migraine without aura (most common - 75%):**
- No warning visual or sensory symptoms
- Sudden onset of headache

**Migraine with aura (25%):**
- Visual or sensory warning signs 5-60 minutes before headache
- Aura can occur without subsequent headache

**Chronic migraine:**
- 15+ headache days per month for >3 months
- At least 8 days per month meeting migraine criteria

**Other types:**
- Vestibular migraine (with dizziness/vertigo)
- Hemiplegic migraine (with temporary paralysis)
- Menstrual migraine (hormone-triggered)
- Status migrainosus (lasting >72 hours)

### Common Causes/Triggers in Veterans

- **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)** - #1 cause in combat veterans
- **PTSD and chronic stress**
- **Neck injuries** (cervicogenic headaches misdiagnosed as migraines)
- **Blast exposure**
- **Sleep deprivation**
- **Tinnitus** (constant ringing causes stress → migraines)
- **Jaw clenching/TMJ** (from stress or TBI)
- **Medication side effects**
- **Bright lights** (hypervigilance from PTSD)
- **Loud noises** (sound sensitivity from TBI)
- **Dehydration** (common in military operations)
- **Irregular sleep** (shift work, deployments)

## VA Rating Criteria for Migraines

Migraines are rated based on **frequency of "prostrating" attacks**. Understanding what "prostrating" means is critical to your rating.

### What Does "Prostrating" Mean?

**Prostrating attack:** A headache severe enough that the veteran must stop all activity and seek a dark, quiet room to lie down.

**Characteristics of prostrating attack:**
- **Severe pain** preventing work or activities
- **Forces cessation** of all activity
- Veteran must lie down in dark, quiet room
- Unable to function during attack
- May include vomiting, severe nausea
- Lasts several hours to days

**NOT prostrating:**
- Headache you can "power through"
- Pain that allows continued work (even at reduced capacity)
- Mild to moderate headaches
- Headaches relieved quickly by over-the-counter medications

**Important:** The VA only counts prostrating attacks for rating purposes. If you have frequent mild headaches and occasional severe attacks, only the severe prostrating attacks count.

---

### 0% Rating

**Criteria:** Diagnosed migraines but attacks are not "prostrating" or are very infrequent.

**Typical Scenario:**
- Headaches manageable with medication
- Can continue working through headaches
- Infrequent severe attacks (less than monthly)
- No functional impairment

**Monthly Compensation:** $0 (establishes service connection for future increases)

---

### 10% Rating

**Criteria:** With less frequent attacks (prostrating attacks occurring **on average once every 2 months over the last several months**).

**What This Means:**
- Approximately **6 prostrating attacks per year**
- Or stated as: prostrating attacks occurring every other month
- Attacks must be severe enough to stop all activity

**Monthly Compensation:**
- Veteran alone: $175.51
- **20-year value:** $42,122

**Documentation Needed:**
- Headache diary showing at least 6 prostrating attacks in past year
- Medical records documenting attacks
- Evidence of severity (vomiting, light sensitivity, forced to lie down)

**Example:**
Veteran has severe migraine requiring bed rest in dark room for 6-8 hours, occurring approximately every 6-8 weeks. Between attacks, may have milder headaches that don't require stopping activities.

---

### 30% Rating

**Criteria:** With characteristic prostrating attacks occurring **on average once a month over the last several months**.

**What This Means:**
- Approximately **12 prostrating attacks per year** (or more)
- At least one severe, disabling attack per month on average
- Consistent pattern over several months (at least 3-4 months)

**Monthly Compensation:**
- Veteran alone: $537.42
- With spouse: $601.42
- With spouse & 1 child: $650.42
- **20-year value:** $128,981 (veteran alone)

**Documentation Needed:**
- Headache diary showing 12+ prostrating attacks per year (averaging monthly or more)
- Medical records from ER visits, urgent care, or provider visits during/after attacks
- Medications: Triptans (Imitrex, Maxalt), anti-nausea meds, preventive meds
- Work absences due to migraines
- Statements from family describing attacks

**Example:**
Veteran has severe migraine with vomiting, light sensitivity, and throbbing pain forcing cessation of all activity for 8-12 hours, occurring 1-2 times per month. Veteran must leave work and lie down in dark room. Takes sumatriptan but attacks still disable veteran for remainder of day.

---

### 50% Rating (Highest)

**Criteria:** Very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. OR: Prostrating attacks occurring **on average once a week or more over the last several months**.

**What This Means:**

**Option 1:** Prostrating attacks weekly or more frequently
- **52+ prostrating attacks per year** (weekly)
- OR more frequent than weekly
- Consistent pattern over last several months

**Option 2:** "Severe economic inadaptability"
- Attacks are so severe and frequent that veteran cannot maintain employment
- Economic hardship directly caused by migraine attacks
- Unable to perform work duties reliably due to migraines

**Monthly Compensation:**
- Veteran alone: $1,102.04
- With spouse: $1,180.04
- With spouse & 1 child: $1,243.04
- With spouse & 2 children: $1,300.04
- **20-year value:** $264,490 (veteran alone)

**Documentation Needed:**
- Headache diary showing 52+ prostrating attacks per year (weekly or more)
- **Employment evidence:** Termination letters, performance reviews citing absences, disability accommodations, reduced hours
- Extensive treatment: Multiple preventive medications, Botox injections, nerve blocks, ER visits
- Frequent medical appointments (neurology, pain management)
- Statements from employers or coworkers about missed work
- Financial hardship evidence (if arguing "severe economic inadaptability")

**Example 1 (Frequent Attacks):**
Veteran has severe prostrating migraines 2-3 times per week, each lasting 12-24 hours. Unable to work during attacks. Has tried multiple preventive medications with limited success. Receives Botox injections every 3 months.

**Example 2 (Economic Inadaptability):**
Veteran has prostrating migraines 2-3 times per month but they are so severe and unpredictable that veteran has been terminated from multiple jobs due to absences. Cannot maintain employment due to unreliability caused by migraines.

## Evidence Requirements for Migraine Claims

### 1. Current Diagnosis

**Migraine diagnosis from:**
- Neurologist (strongest evidence)
- Primary care physician
- Headache specialist
- VA provider
- Private physician

**Diagnosis based on:**
- International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria
- Patient history and symptom description
- Exclusion of other causes (brain imaging if needed)

**No objective test for migraines—diagnosis is clinical based on symptoms.**

### 2. Headache Diary (Critical Evidence)

**A headache diary is the MOST IMPORTANT evidence for migraine claims.**

**What to Track:**
- **Date of headache**
- **Duration** (start time to end time)
- **Severity** (scale 1-10, note if "prostrating")
- **Symptoms** (throbbing pain, nausea, vomiting, light/sound sensitivity, aura)
- **Impact on activities** (had to stop working, lie down, go to ER, miss work)
- **Medications taken** (and effectiveness)
- **Triggers** (if known: stress, lack of sleep, bright lights, certain foods)

**Keep diary for minimum 3-4 months** before filing claim or requesting increase.

**Example Diary Entry:**
"March 15, 2025: Severe migraine started 10:00 AM. Throbbing pain left side of head, severity 9/10. Nausea and vomiting. Extreme light sensitivity. Had to leave work and lie down in dark bedroom. Took Imitrex 100mg at 10:30 AM. Pain decreased to 6/10 by 2:00 PM but remained in bed until 6:00 PM. Total duration: 8 hours prostrating. Missed remainder of work day."

### 3. Service Connection Evidence

**Direct Service Connection (Uncommon):**
- Migraines diagnosed during active duty service
- Service treatment records documenting headaches
- Continuity of symptoms from service to present

**Secondary Service Connection (Most Common):**
Migraines caused by another service-connected condition

#### Common Primary Conditions Causing Secondary Migraines:

**A. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) - #1 Cause**

**Connection:** TBI is the leading cause of post-traumatic headaches and migraines in veterans. Blast exposure, concussions, and head impacts trigger chronic migraines.

**Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraine headaches are a direct result of the service-connected traumatic brain injury sustained in [year]. Post-traumatic headaches are a well-established sequela of TBI. The veteran's migraines began [shortly after/during] the TBI and have persisted, supporting causation."

**Evidence:**
- TBI diagnosis and rating
- Timeline: Migraines began during or after TBI
- Medical literature on post-traumatic headaches
- Neurology records

**B. PTSD and Chronic Stress**

**Connection:** PTSD causes chronic stress, hypervigilance, muscle tension (especially neck/jaw), and sleep disturbance—all migraine triggers.

**Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraines are caused by the service-connected PTSD. Chronic stress and hypervigilance from PTSD cause sustained muscle tension and autonomic nervous system dysregulation, both of which are established migraine triggers. Medical literature supports that individuals with PTSD have significantly higher rates of migraines."

**Evidence:**
- PTSD diagnosis and rating
- Mental health treatment records showing chronic stress
- Timeline showing migraines worsened after PTSD onset

**C. Cervical Spine (Neck) Conditions**

**Connection:** Neck injuries, cervical strain, and degenerative disc disease cause cervicogenic headaches and trigger migraines through referred pain and muscle tension.

**Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraines are caused or aggravated by the service-connected cervical spine condition. Cervical spine pathology causes referred pain to the head and chronic neck muscle tension, both of which trigger migraines."

**Evidence:**
- Cervical spine service-connected rating
- MRI or X-rays showing neck pathology
- Physical therapy records
- Neurology opinion linking neck pain to headaches

**D. Tinnitus**

**Connection:** Constant ringing in ears causes chronic stress, concentration difficulties, and poor sleep—all migraine triggers.

**Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraines are caused by the service-connected tinnitus. The constant, intrusive nature of tinnitus causes chronic stress and sleep disruption, both established migraine triggers."

**Evidence:**
- Tinnitus rating
- Timeline showing migraines developed after tinnitus onset
- Statement describing stress from constant ringing

**E. Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ)**

**Connection:** Jaw clenching and TMJ dysfunction cause referred pain to temples and trigger migraines.

**Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraines are caused by the service-connected TMJ disorder. TMJ dysfunction causes referred pain to the temporal region and chronic jaw muscle tension, both of which trigger migraines."

**Evidence:**
- TMJ diagnosis and rating
- Dental records showing jaw clenching or teeth grinding
- Neurology opinion linking TMJ to headaches

**F. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**

**Connection:** Elevated blood pressure can trigger or worsen migraines.

**Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraines are aggravated by the service-connected hypertension. Elevated blood pressure is a recognized migraine trigger."

**Evidence:**
- Hypertension rating
- Blood pressure records
- Timeline showing migraines worsened with hypertension

### 4. Medical Treatment Records

**Preventive Medications (show migraine severity):**
- Topiramate (Topamax)
- Propranolol
- Amitriptyline
- Botox injections
- CGRP inhibitors (Aimovig, Emgality, Ajovy)
- Nerve blocks

**Abortive Medications (show acute attacks):**
- Triptans (sumatriptan/Imitrex, rizatriptan/Maxalt)
- Ergotamines
- Anti-nausea medications (ondansetron/Zofran)
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)

**Emergency Department/Urgent Care Visits:**
- Records of ER visits for severe migraines
- IV medications (DHE, magnesium, anti-nausea)
- Admission records (for status migrainosus)

**Multiple medication trials and preventive treatments support higher ratings.**

### 5. Employment/Functional Impact Evidence

**For 50% Rating (Economic Inadaptability):**

- **Termination letters** citing excessive absences due to migraines
- **Performance reviews** documenting attendance problems
- **FMLA paperwork** for migraine-related absences
- **Disability accommodation requests** (work from home, flexible hours)
- **Reduced work hours** due to migraines
- **Unemployment** caused by inability to maintain job
- **Vocational rehabilitation** records showing employment barriers

**Statements from Employers/Supervisors:**
"[Veteran] is a valued employee but has missed an average of 3-4 days per month due to severe migraines. The unpredictable nature of the migraines has made it difficult to maintain consistent work performance. We have provided accommodations including work-from-home flexibility, but the frequency of attacks continues to impact productivity."

### 6. Lay Statements (Buddy Statements)

**From Spouse/Family:**
- Describe witnessing prostrating attacks (veteran in dark room, vomiting, unable to function)
- Frequency of attacks
- Impact on family life (missed events, activities canceled)
- Personality changes or mood during attacks

**Example:**
"My husband has severe migraines 2-3 times per week. When an attack starts, he immediately goes to the bedroom, closes all curtains, and lies down. He cannot tolerate any light or sound. He often vomits and cannot eat. These attacks last 8-12 hours. He has missed numerous family events, birthday parties, and holidays because of his migraines. I have seen him leave work early at least once a week due to headaches."

## C&P Exam for Migraines

### What to Expect

**Exam Type:** Headaches C&P exam (may be part of TBI exam if migraines are TBI residual)

**Examiner:** Physician (neurologist, internist, or general practitioner)

**Duration:** 20-40 minutes

**Exam Components:**
1. Medical history review
2. Description of headache characteristics
3. Frequency and severity assessment
4. Review of treatments tried
5. Functional impact assessment
6. Physical/neurological examination
7. Completion of headaches DBQ

### What the Examiner Will Ask

**About Headache Characteristics:**
- What do your headaches feel like? (Throbbing, sharp, pressure, etc.)
- Where is the pain? (One side, both sides, temples, forehead, back of head)
- How severe is the pain? (Scale 1-10)
- How long do headaches last? (Hours, days)
- Do you have warning signs before headaches? (Aura)
- What other symptoms occur? (Nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity)

**About Frequency:**
- How often do you get headaches?
- How many are severe enough that you must stop all activity? **(Critical question for rating)**
- How many headaches per week/month/year?
- Are they getting more or less frequent?

**About Impact on Function:**
- What do you do when you get a severe headache? (Lie down, go to dark room, leave work)
- Can you continue working during headaches, or must you stop?
- How many work days have you missed due to headaches?
- Do headaches force you to cancel plans or miss events?

**About Treatments:**
- What medications have you tried?
- What do you take during an attack? Does it help?
- Are you on preventive medications? Which ones?
- Have you tried Botox, nerve blocks, or other procedures?
- How often do you see a neurologist or headache specialist?
- Have you gone to the ER for headaches?

**About Triggers:**
- What triggers your headaches? (Stress, lack of sleep, bright lights, certain foods, weather changes)

### How to Prepare

**Before Exam:**
- **Bring headache diary** showing at least 3-4 months of headaches with dates, severity, duration, and impact
- Bring list of all medications tried (preventive and abortive)
- Bring medical records from neurology, ER visits, urgent care
- Calculate average number of **prostrating** attacks per month
- Gather employment records if arguing "economic inadaptability" for 50%

**During Exam:**

**DO:**
- Clearly distinguish between **prostrating attacks** (must stop all activity) and milder headaches
- State frequency of prostrating attacks clearly: "I have severe migraines that force me to lie down in a dark room approximately [X times per month/week]"
- Describe typical prostrating attack: severity, duration, symptoms, what you must do (leave work, lie down, vomit, etc.)
- Mention all treatments tried and their limited effectiveness
- Provide specific examples: "Last month I had to leave work early 3 times due to severe migraines"
- Bring headache diary and refer to it for accurate frequencies

**DON'T:**
- Exaggerate frequency (examiner will compare to medical records and diary)
- Confuse mild headaches with prostrating attacks (only severe attacks count)
- Say you "manage" or "tough it out" if you actually must stop activity
- Forget to mention ER visits, Botox treatments, or preventive medications

**Key Phrases for 30% Rating:**
- "I have severe migraines that force me to stop all activity and lie down approximately **once per month** or more"
- "These attacks last 6-12 hours and I cannot work during them"
- "I experience nausea, vomiting, and extreme light sensitivity during attacks"

**Key Phrases for 50% Rating:**
- "I have prostrating migraines **weekly** (or more often)"
- OR: "My migraines occur 2-3 times per month but I have been unable to maintain employment due to the unpredictability and severity of attacks. I have been terminated from [number] jobs due to migraine-related absences."
- "I have tried [list 3+ preventive medications], Botox injections, and nerve blocks with limited success"

---

## Claim Strategy for Higher Migraine Ratings

### Target 30% Rating

**Evidence to Gather:**
- Headache diary showing 12+ prostrating attacks per year (monthly average)
- Medical records from neurology documenting migraines
- Prescription records for triptans or other abortive medications
- Preventive medication trials (at least one)
- Work absences (FMLA, sick days) documenting missed work due to migraines

**Nexus if Secondary:**
- Identify primary service-connected condition (TBI, PTSD, neck condition)
- Obtain nexus letter from neurologist or physician
- Timeline showing migraines began after primary condition

### Target 50% Rating

**Two Pathways:**

**Pathway 1: Weekly or More Frequent Attacks**
- Headache diary showing 52+ prostrating attacks per year
- Medical records documenting very frequent migraines
- Multiple medication trials showing limited success
- Botox injections, nerve blocks, or advanced treatments
- ER visits for severe migraines

**Pathway 2: Economic Inadaptability (Even with Fewer Attacks)**
- Employment evidence:
  - Termination letters citing absences
  - Performance reviews documenting reliability issues
  - Reduced hours or part-time work
  - Disability accommodations that were insufficient
  - Unemployment due to migraines
- Vocational expert opinion stating migraines preclude substantial gainful employment
- Financial hardship evidence

**Even if attacks are "only" 2-3 times per month, if they cause job loss and inability to work, argue for 50% under "severe economic inadaptability" language.**

---

## Combined Ratings: Migraines with Other Conditions

**Example 1:**
- TBI residuals: 40%
- Migraines (TBI residual): 30%
- PTSD: 50%
- Tinnitus: 10%
- **Combined:** 81% → rounds to 80%
- **Monthly:** $2,044.89

**Example 2:**
- Migraines: 50%
- Cervical spine: 20%
- PTSD: 70%
- **Combined:** 88% → rounds to 90%
- **Monthly:** $2,297.96

---

## Success Stories

### Case Study 1: Migraines Secondary to TBI

**Veteran:** Army infantry, blast TBI Iraq 2008
**Initial Rating:** TBI 10% (2010)
**Issue:** Developed severe, frequent migraines after TBI

**Evidence (filed increase + secondary migraine 2015):**
- Headache diary: 15-18 prostrating migraines per month (3-4 per week)
- Neurology records: Tried 4 preventive medications, receiving Botox every 3 months
- ER visits: 6 visits in past year for severe migraines
- Employment: Terminated from job in 2014 due to excessive absences

**Result:**
- TBI: Increased to 40%
- **Migraines (TBI residual): 50%**
- Combined: 70%
- Monthly: $1,759.19

**Key Lesson:** File migraines as separate condition (TBI residual), not rated under TBI itself. This increases total compensation.

---

### Case Study 2: Economic Inadaptability for 50%

**Veteran:** Navy, PTSD 70%
**Secondary Claim:** Migraines secondary to PTSD

**Headache Diary:** 2-3 prostrating migraines per month (not weekly)

**Employment Evidence:**
- Terminated from 3 jobs (2016-2019) due to attendance
- Performance reviews citing "unreliability due to health issues"
- Unable to maintain employment since 2019
- Vocational rehabilitation attempted but unsuccessful due to unpredictable migraines

**Argument:**
Even though attacks occur 2-3 times per month (not weekly), they cause "severe economic inadaptability"—veteran cannot maintain employment due to unpredictability of attacks.

**Result:**
- **Migraines: 50%** (based on economic inadaptability)
- PTSD: 70%
- Combined: 85% → rounds to 90%
- Monthly: $2,297.96

**Key Lesson:** If migraines prevent employment even with fewer than weekly attacks, argue "severe economic inadaptability" for 50% rating.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many migraines per month do I need for 30%?

At least **one prostrating attack per month on average** over several months (so 12+ per year). This is the minimum for 30%.

### What exactly is a "prostrating" attack?

A headache so severe you must **stop all activity** and lie down. You cannot work through it, cannot complete household tasks, cannot function. Typically includes severe pain, nausea/vomiting, and light/sound sensitivity forcing you to seek a dark, quiet room.

### Do tension headaches count for VA rating?

Tension-type headaches are rated under the same diagnostic code (DC 8100). However, to qualify for 10%+, they must be **prostrating**. Most tension headaches are not severe enough to be prostrating.

If you have both tension headaches and migraines, only the prostrating attacks (likely the migraines) count toward rating.

### Can I get 50% for migraines even if they're not weekly?

Yes, if you can show "severe economic inadaptability"—meaning migraines prevent you from maintaining employment. This requires strong employment evidence (terminations, performance reviews, unemployment).

### Do I need to see a neurologist?

It's helpful but not required. A diagnosis from any physician (primary care, VA provider, neurologist) is acceptable. However:
- Neurologist opinions carry more weight
- Neurologist can prescribe advanced treatments (Botox, CGRP inhibitors)
- Neurologist records strengthen claim

### Will the VA reduce my migraine rating if I get better?

Possibly. If migraines improve significantly (attacks become much less frequent), the VA could propose reduction at reexamination. However:
- Migraines are often chronic and fluctuate
- Continue tracking headaches and treatment
- After 5 years, rating is "stabilized" and harder to reduce
- After 20 years, rating is "protected"

### What if I have migraines from multiple causes?

The VA will rate migraines once under the primary cause. For example:
- If you have TBI and PTSD, both could cause migraines
- VA will rate migraines as residual of TBI OR secondary to PTSD (whichever is more favorable)
- You won't get two separate migraine ratings

### Should I go to the ER during severe migraines?

ER visits provide strong evidence of severity. However:
- ER visits are documented in medical records
- Show severity requiring emergency treatment
- Demonstrate attacks are truly "prostrating"

If migraines are so severe you seek ER care, those visits support higher ratings.

### Can over-the-counter medications reduce my rating?

No. The VA rates based on frequency and severity of attacks, not treatment used. Whether you take Tylenol or Imitrex, if attacks are prostrating and frequent, you qualify for higher ratings.

However, lack of treatment may cause VA to question severity. Regular treatment demonstrates ongoing symptoms.

## Conclusion

Migraines are one of the most common and disabling conditions among veterans, particularly those with TBI or PTSD. While ratings only go up to 50%, migraines significantly impact quality of life and economic productivity.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Ratings: 0%, 10%, 30%, or 50% based on frequency of **prostrating** attacks
- **Prostrating** = must stop all activity and lie down
- 30% = monthly attacks (12+ per year)
- 50% = weekly attacks OR severe economic inadaptability
- **Headache diary is critical evidence**—track for 3-4 months minimum
- Most veteran migraines are **secondary to TBI, PTSD, neck injuries, or tinnitus**
- Migraines often rated separately from TBI as "TBI residual" for higher combined rating
- Employment evidence (terminations, absences) supports 50% "economic inadaptability" claim

If you have frequent, severe headaches preventing work and activities, fight for an accurate rating that reflects the true impact of migraines on your life.
