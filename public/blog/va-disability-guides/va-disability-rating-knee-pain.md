## Understanding Knee VA Disability Ratings

Knee injuries and arthritis are among the most common musculoskeletal conditions affecting veterans. The VA rates knee conditions based on range of motion limitation, instability, pain on motion, and functional impairment.

The VA rates knee conditions under 38 CFR § 4.71a using multiple diagnostic codes depending on the specific condition.

### Common Knee Diagnostic Codes

**DC 5257: Knee Replacement (Prosthesis)**
- Minimum 30% rating for prosthetic knee replacement

**DC 5260: Limitation of Flexion (Bending)**
- Rated based on degrees of flexion loss

**DC 5261: Limitation of Extension (Straightening)**
- Rated based on degrees of extension loss (flexion contracture)

**DC 5262: Lateral Instability**
- Rated based on degrees of laxity (looseness)

**DC 5258: Cartilage Removal**
- Semilunar cartilage (meniscus) removal

**DC 5259: Cartilage Dislocated (Removal)**
- Recurrent subluxation or dislocation of patella

**DC 5003: Degenerative Arthritis**
- Used in conjunction with ROM limitation

**The VA will rate under the diagnostic code that provides the highest rating.**

### Lateral Instability (DC 5262)

Instability = knee "gives way" due to ligament damage (ACL, MCL, LCL, PCL)

**Ratings:**

**10%:** Slight lateral instability
- Mild laxity on examination
- Occasional giving way during activities

- Even partial meniscectomy qualifies

**Note:** This rating can combine with ROM limitation for the same knee using the "bilateral factor" or pyramiding rules.

---

### Recurrent Subluxation/Dislocation of Patella (DC 5259)

**10%:** Recurrent subluxation or dislocation of patella (kneecap)
- Documented episodes of kneecap slipping out of place
- May require surgical stabilization

**20%:** With frequent episodes and substantial functional impairment

---

### Total Knee Replacement (DC 5257)

**30% Minimum** for total knee replacement (prosthetic knee)
- May be rated higher if ROM is limited beyond replacement baseline
- Examiner measures ROM after healing period

---

## Common Knee Conditions and Their Ratings

### 1. Meniscus Tear/Meniscectomy

**Condition:** Torn cartilage in knee, often from twisting injury or degeneration

**Rating:**
- **10%:** Meniscus removal (partial or complete)
- **Can combine with ROM limitation if knee flexion/extension is limited**

**Evidence:**
- MRI showing meniscus tear
- Surgical report documenting meniscectomy
- Post-surgical ROM measurements

---

### 2. Osteoarthritis/Degenerative Joint Disease

**Condition:** Wear-and-tear arthritis causing pain, stiffness, and ROM limitation

**Rating:**
- **Based on ROM limitation:** 0%-60%
- **Pain on weight-bearing qualifies for at least 10%** even if ROM is near-normal

**Evidence:**
- X-rays showing joint space narrowing, bone spurs, cartilage loss
- ROM measurements
- Pain documentation
- Functional limitations

**Note:** Arthritis itself doesn't have a separate rating—it's rated based on the ROM limitation and pain it causes.

---

### 3. ACL/PCL/MCL/LCL Tear (Ligament Injuries)

**Condition:** Torn knee ligaments causing instability

**Rating:**
- **10%-30%:** Based on degree of instability (DC 5262)
- **Can combine with ROM limitation** from same injury

- Functional limitations (giving way episodes)
- Brace use

---

### 4. Patellofemoral Syndrome (Chondromalacia Patella)

**Condition:** Cartilage damage under kneecap causing anterior knee pain

**Rating:**
- **Based on ROM limitation or pain on motion:** 0%-20% typically
- **May qualify for 10%** for painful motion even with normal ROM

**Evidence:**
- Clinical diagnosis
- Pain with stairs, kneeling, squatting
- ROM measurements
- Functional limitations

---

### 5. Total Knee Replacement

**Condition:** Surgical replacement of knee joint

**Rating:**
- **Minimum 30%** for prosthetic knee
- **May be higher** if ROM is limited after replacement

**Evidence:**
- Surgical records documenting total knee arthroplasty
- Post-operative ROM measurements
- Functional assessment

---

## Evidence Requirements for Knee Claims

### 1. Current Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Testing:**
- **X-rays:** Show arthritis, fractures, bone spurs, alignment
- **MRI:** Shows soft tissue damage (meniscus tears, ligament tears, cartilage damage)
- **Physical examination:** ROM measurement, stability testing, pain assessment

### 2. Range of Motion Measurements

**Critical Evidence:** ROM must be measured by healthcare provider using goniometer

**Flexion:**
- Measured lying flat or sitting
- Heel brought toward buttocks
- Degrees measured at maximum flexion

**Extension:**
- Measured lying flat
- Knee straightened as much as possible
- Any gap between back of knee and table = flexion contracture

**Pain on Motion:**
- Document if pain limits ROM
- Pain at end of range vs. throughout range
- Functional impact of pain

**Important:** ROM measurements must be done on multiple occasions to establish consistency (flare-ups vs. baseline).

### 3. Service Connection Evidence

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Injury during active duty
- Service treatment records documenting knee injury
- Continuity of symptoms from service to present

**Presumptive for Former POWs:**
- Knee osteoarthritis is presumptive for former prisoners of war if 10%+ disabling

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing knee condition made worse by service
- Must show baseline and worsening

**Secondary Service Connection:**
- Knee condition caused by another service-connected condition (e.g., opposite knee arthritis from compensating for service-connected knee; knee arthritis from altered gait due to back injury)

### 4. Functional Impact Evidence

- Difficulty with stairs
- Cannot kneel or squat
- Difficulty getting in/out of vehicles
- Use of assistive devices (cane, knee brace, crutches)
- Difficulty standing from seated position
- Inability to run or walk long distances
- Work limitations (cannot stand for long periods, cannot lift, cannot climb ladders)

## C&P Exam for Knee Conditions

### What to Expect

**Exam Duration:** 30-45 minutes

**Examiner:** Physician (orthopedic specialist, physiatrist, or general practitioner)

**Exam Components:**
1. Review of medical history and imaging
2. Visual inspection (swelling, deformity, scarring)
3. Palpation (tenderness, warmth, effusion)
4. **Range of motion measurement** (goniometer)
5. Stability testing (ligament integrity)
6. Gait assessment
7. Functional assessment
8. Completion of joints DBQ

### ROM Measurement

**Flexion Test:**
- Lie flat or sit
- Examiner bends knee as far as possible
- Measures angle with goniometer
- Notes if pain limits motion

**Extension Test:**
- Lie flat
- Knee straightened as much as possible
- Measures any gap (flexion contracture)

**Important:** ROM may be **better during exam** due to adrenaline or recent warm-up. Examiners should measure ROM after repeated use to capture functional ROM.

### How to Prepare

**DO:**
- Bring all imaging (X-rays, MRI) and surgical records
- Describe worst pain and limitations, not best days
- Demonstrate actual limitations (don't force ROM beyond what you can functionally do)
- Mention pain during ROM testing
- Describe functional impact (stairs, squatting, kneeling, driving)
- Note use of braces, canes, or assistive devices

**DON'T:**
- Minimize pain or limitations
- Try to perform better than your typical function (this can lower rating)
- Forget to mention pain on motion
- Fail to mention flare-ups after use

## Bilateral Factor for Both Knees

If both knees are service-connected, the VA applies a "bilateral factor" increasing combined rating before combining with other conditions.

**Example:**
- Right knee: 20%
- Left knee: 20%

**Combined bilateral:**
1. Start with higher: 20%
2. Add (lower × remaining efficiency): 20% + (80% × 20%) = 20% + 16% = 36%
3. **Apply bilateral factor:** 36% × 1.10 = 39.6% → rounds to **40%**

This bilateral adjustment recognizes that having both knees disabled is more disabling than one knee alone.

---

## Secondary Conditions to Knee Problems

### 1. Lumbar Spine Strain

**Connection:** Knee problems cause altered gait and compensatory movements, straining lower back.

**Evidence:**
- Timeline: Back pain developed after knee injury
- Gait analysis showing antalgic gait (limping)
- Nexus letter from physician linking back strain to altered gait from knee condition

### 2. Hip Arthritis

**Connection:** Compensating for knee pain causes abnormal hip mechanics and stress, leading to hip arthritis.

**Evidence:**
- Hip X-rays showing arthritis
- Timeline: Hip pain after knee condition
- Nexus letter

### 3. Opposite Knee Arthritis

**Connection:** Overusing opposite leg to compensate for injured knee causes arthritis in that knee.

**Evidence:**
- Opposite knee X-rays showing arthritis
- Timeline: Second knee problem developed after first knee injury
- Nexus letter explaining overcompensation mechanism

---

## Success Story

**Veteran:** Infantry soldier, Iraq 2005-2007
**Initial Injury:** Right knee meniscus tear during patrol (2006)
**Initial Rating:** Right knee 10% (meniscectomy) - 2009

**Worsening over time:**
- Right knee arthritis developed
- Left knee arthritis from overcompensation
- Lumbar strain from altered gait

**Evidence for Increase (filed 2018):**
- Right knee X-rays: Severe arthritis
- Right knee ROM: Flexion 80° (20% rating)
- Left knee X-rays: Moderate arthritis
- Left knee ROM: Flexion 100° (10% rating)
- Lumbar spine MRI: Degenerative disc disease
- Lumbar ROM: Limited flexion (20% rating)
- Nexus letters for secondary conditions

**Final Ratings (2019):**
- Right knee arthritis: **20%**
- Right knee meniscectomy: **10%** (separate for same knee using pyramiding exception)
- Left knee arthritis (secondary): **10%**
- Lumbar strain (secondary): **20%**

**Combined:** Using bilateral factor for knees, then adding back = **50%** combined

**Monthly:** $1,102.04

**Key Lesson:** File for increases as arthritis worsens. File secondary claims for opposite knee and back problems caused by original knee injury.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get more than 10% for meniscus removal?

Yes. The 10% for meniscectomy is a minimum. If your knee ROM is limited after meniscus removal, you can be rated higher based on flexion/extension limitation.

For example:
- Meniscectomy: 10%
- Flexion limited to 95°: 10%
- **Combined for same knee:** May receive 20% total

### Does pain count for VA knee rating?

Yes. Even if ROM is near-normal, if you have pain on weight-bearing or painful motion, you may qualify for at least 10% under "painful motion" principle.

### What if my knee ROM varies (good days and bad days)?

The VA should rate based on your typical functioning, with consideration for flare-ups. Provide evidence of ROM limitations during flare-ups and describe frequency.

### Can both knees be service-connected?

Yes. Each knee is rated separately, and bilateral factor is applied for additional combined rating increase.

### Will I get a higher rating after knee replacement?

You'll receive minimum 30% for the prosthetic knee replacement. If your ROM is limited after surgery (even after healing), you may receive higher than 30%.
