## Understanding Sleep Apnea VA Disability Ratings

Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. It is one of the most commonly claimed conditions among veterans, particularly those with PTSD, obesity, or other service-connected conditions.

The VA rates sleep apnea under 38 CFR § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847 (sleep apnea syndromes).

### What is Obstructive Sleep Apnea?

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) occurs when throat muscles intermittently relax and block the airway during sleep, causing:
- **Apneas:** Complete cessation of breathing for 10+ seconds
- **Hypopneas:** Partial reduction in breathing with oxygen desaturation
- Repeated awakenings throughout the night (often unremembered)
- Fragmented, non-restorative sleep

**Symptoms:**
- Loud snoring
- Gasping or choking during sleep
- Witnessed breathing pauses by bed partner
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Morning headaches
- Difficulty concentrating
- Memory problems
- Irritability and mood changes
- Dry mouth or sore throat upon waking
- Night sweats

### Types of Sleep Apnea

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) - Most Common (90%+ of cases):**
Physical blockage of airway by soft tissue collapse

**Central Sleep Apnea:**
Brain fails to send signals to breathing muscles (neurological)

**Complex/Mixed Sleep Apnea:**
Combination of obstructive and central

The VA rates all types using the same criteria under DC 6847.

### Service Connection Pathways

**Direct Service Connection (Rare):**
- Sleep apnea diagnosed during active duty
- Service treatment records documenting diagnosis
- Continuity of symptoms since service

**Secondary Service Connection (Most Common):**
- Sleep apnea caused or aggravated by service-connected condition
- Common primary conditions: PTSD, depression, rhinitis/sinusitis, obesity, asthma, GERD, hypothyroidism, traumatic brain injury (TBI)

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing mild sleep apnea worsened by military service or service-connected conditions

## VA Rating Criteria for Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is rated based on symptom severity and treatment requirements under 38 CFR § 4.97, DC 6847.

### 0% Rating

**Criteria:** Asymptomatic sleep apnea with documented sleep disorder breathing but no treatment required or symptoms.

**Typical Scenario:**
- Sleep study shows mild sleep apnea (AHI 5-15)
- No daytime symptoms
- No treatment required
- Incidental finding

**Monthly Compensation:** $0 (establishes service connection for future increases)

**Rare:** Most veterans with diagnosed sleep apnea have symptoms and require treatment, qualifying for 30%-50%.

---

### 30% Rating

**Criteria:** Persistent day-time hypersomnolence.

**What This Means:**
"Persistent daytime hypersomnolence" = excessive daytime sleepiness that persists despite any treatment

**Typical Scenarios:**
- Sleep apnea diagnosed but veteran not using CPAP or other treatment consistently
- Mild to moderate sleep apnea (AHI 15-30) with daytime sleepiness
- Treatment attempted but not fully effective in eliminating sleepiness
- Veteran refuses CPAP or cannot tolerate it

**Monthly Compensation:**
- Veteran alone: $537.42
- With spouse: $601.42
- With spouse & 1 child: $650.42
- **20-year value:** $128,981 (veteran alone)

**Functional Impact:**
- Falling asleep during meetings, while driving, or during daily activities
- Difficulty staying awake at work
- Excessive napping
- Fatigue despite adequate sleep opportunity

**Important:** If you refuse CPAP treatment or don't use it consistently, you'll likely receive 30% rather than 50%.

---

### 50% Rating (Most Common)

**Criteria:** Requires use of breathing assistance device such as continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine.

**What This Means:**
- Sleep apnea diagnosed by sleep study
- CPAP machine prescribed
- Veteran uses CPAP regularly for treatment

**Requirements for 50%:**
- Sleep study documenting sleep apnea
- CPAP prescription from sleep specialist
- Evidence of CPAP usage (compliance data from machine)

**Monthly Compensation:**
- Veteran alone: $1,102.04
- With spouse: $1,180.04
- With spouse & 1 child: $1,243.04
- With spouse & 2 children: $1,300.04
- **20-year value:** $264,490 (veteran alone)

**Important Notes:**
- You do NOT need to use CPAP every night to qualify
- You only need to have been prescribed CPAP and use it as treatment
- Even if you use CPAP only occasionally, you should receive 50% (though the VA may question compliance)
- The rating is for the requirement to use CPAP, not the effectiveness of treatment

**Other Breathing Assistance Devices That Qualify for 50%:**
- BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)
- APAP (Auto-Adjusting PAP)
- Oral appliance (mandibular advancement device) prescribed for sleep apnea
- Any mechanical breathing device for sleep apnea

---

### 100% Rating

**Criteria:** Chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure), OR; requires tracheostomy.

**What This Means:**

**Chronic Respiratory Failure with CO2 Retention:**
- Blood tests (arterial blood gas) showing elevated carbon dioxide levels
- Severe sleep apnea causing chronic hypoventilation
- May require supplemental oxygen

**Cor Pulmonale:**
- Right-sided heart failure caused by chronic lung disease (including severe sleep apnea)
- Echocardiogram or other testing showing right heart enlargement or dysfunction
- Symptoms: leg swelling, shortness of breath, fatigue

**Tracheostomy:**
- Surgical opening in neck to maintain airway
- Extremely rare for sleep apnea alone

**Monthly Compensation:**
- Veteran alone: $3,831.30
- With spouse: $4,019.30
- With spouse & 1 child: $4,123.30
- With spouse & 2 children: $4,221.30
- **20-year value:** $919,512 (veteran alone)

**Rare:** 100% rating for sleep apnea is uncommon unless severe complications have developed.

## Evidence Requirements for Sleep Apnea Claims

### 1. Current Diagnosis - Sleep Study Required

You MUST have a sleep study (polysomnography) documenting sleep apnea. Home sleep studies or overnight oximetry may be accepted, but in-lab sleep studies are strongest evidence.

**Sleep Study Results Must Show:**
- **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI):** Number of apneas + hypopneas per hour of sleep
  - Normal: AHI < 5
  - Mild: AHI 5-14
  - Moderate: AHI 15-29
  - Severe: AHI ≥ 30
- Oxygen desaturation events
- Sleep fragmentation (frequent awakenings)
- Sleep architecture disruption

**Where to Get Sleep Study:**
- VA sleep clinic (free for VA healthcare enrollees)
- Private sleep center (may need to pay, but report is usable for VA claim)
- Home sleep test (less comprehensive but accepted)

### 2. CPAP Prescription and Compliance Data

For 50% rating, you need:
- CPAP machine prescribed by sleep specialist
- Evidence you're using CPAP (compliance data from machine)

**CPAP Compliance Data:**
- Modern CPAP machines track usage electronically
- Shows hours used per night, mask leak, AHI while using CPAP
- VA may request compliance data to verify CPAP use
- "Good compliance" = using CPAP at least 4 hours per night, 70% of nights (but even less usage should still qualify for 50%)

**If You Can't Tolerate CPAP:**
- Oral appliance (mandibular advancement device) also qualifies for 50%
- If no treatment tolerated, you may receive 30% for persistent hypersomnolence

### 3. Service Connection Evidence

**Direct Service Connection (Rare):**
Sleep apnea rarely begins during military service, so direct service connection is uncommon. However, it can be established with:
- Service treatment records showing sleep apnea diagnosis during service
- Sleep study performed during service
- Medical evidence of continuity of condition from service to present

**Secondary Service Connection (Most Common Pathway):**
Sleep apnea caused or aggravated by another service-connected condition. You must provide:

**A. Established Primary Service-Connected Condition**

**B. Medical Nexus Opinion** linking sleep apnea to primary condition

**C. Medical Literature** supporting connection (if applicable)

### Common Primary Conditions Causing Secondary Sleep Apnea

#### 1. PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)

**Connection:**
- PTSD causes hypervigilance, nightmares, and fragmented sleep → sleep deprivation → weight gain → sleep apnea
- PTSD medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics) cause weight gain → sleep apnea
- PTSD disrupts sleep architecture, worsening or causing sleep apnea

**Nexus Statement Example:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by the service-connected PTSD. PTSD causes chronic sleep disruption, hypervigilance, and nightmares, leading to fragmented sleep and weight gain, both of which contribute to sleep apnea. Additionally, medications for PTSD (SSRIs, antipsychotics) commonly cause weight gain, further increasing sleep apnea risk. Medical literature supports that veterans with PTSD have 2-3 times higher rates of sleep apnea compared to veterans without PTSD."

**Evidence to Include:**
- PTSD rating and treatment records
- Weight gain timeline corresponding to PTSD diagnosis or medication
- Sleep study showing sleep apnea
- Medical literature on PTSD-sleep apnea connection
- Nexus letter from sleep specialist or psychiatrist

#### 2. Rhinitis/Sinusitis (Allergic or Chronic)

**Connection:**
- Nasal congestion from rhinitis/sinusitis blocks upper airway → obstructive sleep apnea
- Inflammation of nasal passages reduces airflow during sleep
- Chronic mouth breathing due to nasal obstruction worsens sleep apnea

**Nexus Statement Example:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by the service-connected rhinitis. Chronic nasal congestion obstructs the upper airway, particularly during sleep when muscle tone decreases. This obstruction leads to apneic events and hypopneas characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea."

**Evidence:**
- Service-connected rhinitis/sinusitis rating
- ENT records documenting nasal obstruction
- Sleep study
- Nexus letter from ENT or sleep specialist

#### 3. Asthma

**Connection:**
- Asthma medications (corticosteroids) cause weight gain → sleep apnea
- Asthma and sleep apnea share inflammatory pathways
- Nocturnal asthma worsens sleep quality and contributes to sleep apnea

**Nexus Statement Example:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by service-connected asthma. Chronic corticosteroid use for asthma control has caused weight gain, a primary risk factor for sleep apnea. Additionally, asthma and sleep apnea are known to be comorbid conditions with shared inflammatory mechanisms."

#### 4. GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)

**Connection:**
- GERD worsens sleep apnea and vice versa (bidirectional relationship)
- Acid reflux irritates throat, causing swelling that narrows airway
- Sleep apnea increases abdominal pressure, worsening reflux

**Nexus Statement Example:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by service-connected GERD. Chronic acid reflux causes pharyngeal inflammation and swelling, contributing to upper airway obstruction during sleep. Medical literature supports a bidirectional relationship between GERD and sleep apnea."

#### 5. Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid)

**Connection:**
- Hypothyroidism causes weight gain → sleep apnea
- Thyroid hormone deficiency causes swelling of throat tissues → airway narrowing
- Hypothyroidism reduces respiratory drive during sleep

**Nexus Statement Example:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by service-connected hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism causes weight gain and macroglossia (tongue enlargement) with upper airway soft tissue swelling, both of which contribute to obstructive sleep apnea."

#### 6. Depression/Anxiety

**Connection (same mechanism as PTSD):**
- Mental health conditions cause poor sleep → weight gain → sleep apnea
- Antidepressant medications cause weight gain
- Depression causes decreased physical activity → weight gain

#### 7. Obesity (if service-connected)

**Connection:**
- Obesity is the strongest risk factor for sleep apnea
- Excess weight around neck and throat narrows airway
- Abdominal obesity reduces lung capacity

**Note:** Obesity itself is not typically directly service-connected, but can be secondary to other conditions (PTSD, depression, hypothyroidism, physical injuries limiting activity).

#### 8. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

**Connection:**
- TBI disrupts central respiratory control → central or mixed sleep apnea
- TBI damages brainstem areas regulating breathing
- TBI causes weight gain and physical inactivity → obstructive sleep apnea

#### 9. Chronic Pain Conditions

**Connection:**
- Chronic pain causes poor sleep → weight gain → sleep apnea
- Pain medications (opioids) worsen sleep apnea by suppressing respiratory drive
- Reduced physical activity due to pain → weight gain

### 4. Nexus Letter for Secondary Sleep Apnea

A strong nexus letter from a sleep specialist, pulmonologist, or primary care physician should include:

**Components:**
1. **Veteran's diagnosis:** "The veteran has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea based on sleep study performed on [date] showing AHI of [number]."

2. **Primary service-connected condition:** "The veteran has service-connected [PTSD/rhinitis/asthma/etc.] rated at [percentage]."

3. **Medical opinion:** "It is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that the veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by the service-connected [primary condition]."

4. **Mechanism/rationale:** Explain how primary condition causes sleep apnea:
   - PTSD → sleep disruption + weight gain → sleep apnea
   - Rhinitis → nasal obstruction → upper airway narrowing → sleep apnea
   - Hypothyroidism → weight gain + throat swelling → sleep apnea

5. **Medical literature (optional but helpful):** Cite studies showing connection between primary condition and sleep apnea.

6. **Timeline:** "The veteran's sleep apnea was diagnosed in [year], which is [X years] after the onset of service-connected [primary condition], supporting a causal relationship."

7. **Provider credentials:** Include physician's qualifications (board-certified in sleep medicine, pulmonology, etc.).

## C&P Exam for Sleep Apnea

### What to Expect

**Exam Type:** Respiratory C&P exam (not a sleep study)

**Examiner:** Physician (internal medicine, pulmonology, or general practice)

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

**Exam Components:**
1. Review of sleep study results
2. Review of CPAP prescription and usage
3. Medical history (symptoms, treatment, primary conditions)
4. Physical examination (may include throat exam, BMI measurement)
5. Completion of DBQ for sleep apnea

**Note:** The C&P exam is NOT a sleep study. You must have a sleep study already completed before the C&P exam.

### What the Examiner Will Ask

**About Sleep Apnea Symptoms:**
- Do you snore? How loudly? (Ask bed partner)
- Has anyone witnessed you stop breathing during sleep?
- Do you wake up gasping or choking?
- Do you have excessive daytime sleepiness?
- Do you fall asleep during the day unintentionally?
- Do you have morning headaches?
- Do you have difficulty concentrating or memory problems?

**About Treatment:**
- Have you had a sleep study? When? What were the results (AHI)?
- Do you use CPAP? How often? How many hours per night?
- Can you tolerate CPAP? Any issues with mask fit, air pressure, claustrophobia?
- Do you use any other treatment? (Oral appliance, positional therapy, surgery)
- Has treatment improved your symptoms?

**About Service Connection:**
- What service-connected conditions do you have?
- When was sleep apnea diagnosed in relation to service-connected condition?
- Have you gained weight? When? Why? (medication, injury limiting activity, etc.)
- Do you have nasal congestion or breathing problems?

### How to Prepare

**Before the Exam:**
- Bring copy of sleep study report showing AHI
- Bring CPAP compliance data (ask CPAP supplier or download from machine)
- List all service-connected conditions (especially PTSD, rhinitis, asthma, depression)
- Note when sleep apnea was diagnosed and when primary condition began
- Document weight gain timeline if applicable

**During the Exam:**

**DO:**
- Bring sleep study report and CPAP prescription
- Clearly state you use CPAP regularly (if you do) for 50% rating
- Mention all symptoms: snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, morning headaches
- Explain connection to service-connected condition (e.g., "My PTSD medications caused weight gain, and my psychiatrist said this contributed to my sleep apnea")
- Describe how sleep apnea affects your daily life (falling asleep at work, difficulty concentrating, fatigue)

**DON'T:**
- Say you don't use CPAP if you've been prescribed one (may receive 30% instead of 50%)
- Minimize symptoms (describe worst effects)
- Forget to mention service-connected primary condition as cause
- Say sleep apnea started before service-connected condition (weakens nexus)

**Key Points to Make for 50% Rating:**
- "I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea based on a sleep study showing AHI of [number]"
- "I have been prescribed a CPAP machine and use it regularly for treatment"
- "My sleep apnea is related to my service-connected [PTSD/rhinitis/etc.]"

**For 100% Rating (if applicable):**
- Mention chronic respiratory failure diagnosed by physician
- Provide blood gas test results showing CO2 retention
- Mention cor pulmonale (right heart failure) diagnosis with echocardiogram results

## Claim Strategy for Sleep Apnea

### Step 1: Get Sleep Study

**If you suspect sleep apnea (snoring, daytime sleepiness, witnessed apneas), get a sleep study:**
- VA sleep clinic (if VA healthcare enrolled)
- Private sleep center
- Home sleep test

Without a sleep study, your claim will be denied.

### Step 2: Get CPAP Prescription

**If sleep study shows sleep apnea, get CPAP prescribed:**
- Sleep specialist will prescribe CPAP based on sleep study results
- Get fitted for CPAP mask
- Use CPAP regularly (even if just a few hours per night)

Using CPAP qualifies you for 50% rating ($1,102.04/month vs. $537.42/month for 30%).

### Step 3: Establish Service Connection

**Most veterans file for sleep apnea secondary to another service-connected condition.**

**Identify your primary service-connected condition:**
- PTSD (most common)
- Rhinitis/sinusitis
- Asthma
- GERD
- Hypothyroidism
- Depression/anxiety
- TBI
- Obesity (if secondary to another condition)

**Get nexus letter:**
- From sleep specialist, pulmonologist, or primary care physician
- Explain how primary condition caused sleep apnea
- Include timeline (sleep apnea diagnosed after primary condition onset)

### Step 4: File Claim

**VA Form 21-526EZ:**
- Check "new conditions"
- List "Sleep Apnea Secondary to [Primary Condition]"
- Upload: Sleep study report, CPAP prescription, nexus letter, CPAP compliance data

**Timeline:** 4-8 months for decision

### Step 5: Attend C&P Exam

- Bring all documentation
- Clearly state you use CPAP
- Explain connection to service-connected condition

### Step 6: File for Secondary Conditions to Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea causes multiple secondary conditions that can increase total rating:
- Hypertension (high blood pressure)
- Heart arrhythmias
- Type 2 diabetes
- GERD
- Depression (if not already service-connected)
- Erectile dysfunction
- Cognitive impairment

---

## Common Secondary Conditions to Sleep Apnea

### 1. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

**Connection:** Sleep apnea causes repeated oxygen drops and stress hormone surges during sleep, leading to sustained high blood pressure.

**Rating Potential:** 0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, or 60%
- 10%: Diastolic 100-109 or systolic 160-199
- 20%: Diastolic 110-119 or systolic 200+
- 40%: Diastolic 130+ or need for multi-drug therapy

**Evidence:**
- Blood pressure readings showing hypertension
- Timeline: hypertension developed after sleep apnea diagnosis
- Nexus letter: "Sleep apnea → chronic intermittent hypoxia → sustained hypertension"

### 2. Heart Arrhythmias (Atrial Fibrillation, etc.)

**Connection:** Sleep apnea causes oxygen drops and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, triggering irregular heart rhythms.

**Rating Potential:** 0%, 10%, 30%, 60%, or 100%
- 30%: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
- 60%: Persistent atrial fibrillation

**Evidence:**
- EKG or Holter monitor showing arrhythmia
- Cardiology records
- Nexus letter connecting arrhythmia to sleep apnea

### 3. Type 2 Diabetes

**Connection:** Sleep apnea causes insulin resistance through multiple mechanisms (sleep disruption, intermittent hypoxia, stress hormones).

**Rating Potential:** 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, or 100%
- 20%: Requires insulin or oral hypoglycemic
- 40%: Requires insulin and restricted diet

**Evidence:**
- Diabetes diagnosis and treatment records
- Timeline showing diabetes onset after sleep apnea
- Nexus letter explaining sleep apnea → insulin resistance → diabetes

### 4. GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)

**Connection:** Bidirectional relationship - sleep apnea worsens GERD and vice versa due to pressure changes and anatomical factors.

**Rating Potential:** 10%, 30%, or 60%

**Evidence:**
- GERD diagnosis
- Timeline
- Nexus letter

### 5. Erectile Dysfunction

**Connection:** Sleep apnea causes hormonal changes (reduced testosterone), vascular dysfunction, and fatigue, all contributing to ED.

**Rating Potential:** 0% with SMC-K ($127.19/month)

**Evidence:**
- Urological evaluation
- Nexus letter connecting ED to sleep apnea

## Success Stories

### Case Study 1: Sleep Apnea Secondary to PTSD

**Veteran:** Army combat veteran, Iraq 2007-2008
**Primary Condition:** PTSD rated 70%
**Issue:** Developed sleep apnea, gained 60 pounds after PTSD diagnosis

**Evidence:**
- Sleep study: AHI 42 (severe sleep apnea)
- CPAP prescribed and used regularly
- Nexus letter from sleep specialist explaining PTSD → poor sleep + PTSD medications → weight gain → sleep apnea
- Medical records showing weight gain timeline corresponding to PTSD medication

**Result:**
- Sleep apnea secondary to PTSD: 50%
- Combined: PTSD 70% + Sleep apnea 50% = 85% → rounds to 90%
- Monthly pay increased from $1,759.19 (70%) to $2,297.96 (90%)
- **Increase: $538.77/month = $129,325 over 20 years**

**Key Lesson:** PTSD and sleep apnea commonly occur together. File for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD with nexus letter explaining the connection.

---

### Case Study 2: Sleep Apnea Secondary to Rhinitis

**Veteran:** Navy veteran, rhinitis rated 10%
**Issue:** Chronic nasal congestion led to sleep apnea

**Evidence:**
- ENT records documenting severe nasal obstruction
- Sleep study: AHI 28 (moderate sleep apnea)
- CPAP prescription
- Nexus letter from ENT: "Chronic rhinitis causes nasal obstruction → upper airway narrowing → obstructive sleep apnea"

**Result:**
- Rhinitis: 10%
- Sleep apnea secondary to rhinitis: 50%
- Combined: 10% + 50% = 55% → rounds to 60%
- Monthly pay: $1,395.93

**Key Lesson:** Even a 10% service-connected rhinitis can lead to 50% for secondary sleep apnea, dramatically increasing total compensation.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to use CPAP every night to get 50%?

No. The regulation states you must "require use" of CPAP, not that you use it perfectly every night. However:
- The VA may request CPAP compliance data
- Some regional offices require evidence of at least occasional CPAP use
- If you never use CPAP despite being prescribed, the VA may argue you don't "require" it

**Best practice:** Use CPAP at least several nights per week and document usage.

### What if I can't tolerate CPAP?

If you've tried CPAP but can't tolerate it:
- **Oral appliance:** Mandibular advancement device also qualifies for 50%
- **Surgery:** If you've had surgery for sleep apnea (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, etc.), you may qualify for 50%
- **30% rating:** If no breathing device is used, you'll likely receive 30% for persistent hypersomnolence

### Can sleep apnea be directly service-connected?

Yes, but it's rare. Sleep apnea typically develops years after service. Direct service connection requires:
- Sleep apnea diagnosed during active duty (service treatment records)
- OR: Evidence of in-service onset with continuity to present

Most veterans file secondary to PTSD, rhinitis, or other service-connected conditions.

### How do I prove sleep apnea is secondary to PTSD?

**Evidence needed:**
1. Service-connected PTSD already established
2. Sleep study documenting sleep apnea
3. Nexus letter from psychiatrist, sleep specialist, or physician explaining:
   - PTSD causes sleep disruption → weight gain → sleep apnea
   - PTSD medications cause weight gain → sleep apnea
   - Timeline: sleep apnea diagnosed after PTSD onset
4. Medical literature supporting PTSD-sleep apnea connection
5. Weight gain documentation (medical records showing weight increase after PTSD diagnosis)

### Will the VA reduce my 50% rating if I stop using CPAP?

Potentially. If the VA schedules a reexamination and finds you no longer use CPAP, they may propose reduction to 30%. However:
- You must receive notice of proposed reduction
- You can submit evidence explaining continued need for CPAP
- Ratings are protected after 5 years and 20 years

**Best practice:** Continue using CPAP to maintain 50% rating.

### Can I get 100% for sleep apnea?

Only if you develop chronic respiratory failure with CO2 retention or cor pulmonale (right heart failure). This requires:
- Blood gas testing showing elevated CO2
- Pulmonary function testing
- Echocardiogram showing right heart dysfunction
- Severe sleep apnea with complications

100% for sleep apnea is very rare.

### Should I file for sleep apnea even if my AHI is only mildly elevated?

Yes. Even mild sleep apnea (AHI 5-15) qualifies for VA disability if you require CPAP. The rating is based on treatment requirement, not AHI severity:
- AHI 5 with CPAP prescribed = 50%
- AHI 50 with CPAP prescribed = 50%

Both receive the same rating.

### Can obesity be service-connected to support sleep apnea claim?

Obesity itself is generally not directly service-connected. However, obesity can be:
- **Secondary to PTSD** (PTSD → sedentary lifestyle + medications → weight gain)
- **Secondary to physical injuries** (knee injury → inability to exercise → weight gain)
- **Secondary to hypothyroidism**

If obesity is service-connected as secondary, then sleep apnea can be secondary to obesity.

### How long does a sleep apnea claim take?

**4-8 months** on average from filing to decision. Timeline:
1. File claim
2. VA requests medical records (1-2 months)
3. VA schedules C&P exam (2-4 months wait)
4. VA rates claim (1-2 months after exam)
5. Decision letter mailed

### What if my sleep apnea claim is denied?

**Common denial reasons:**
1. **No sleep study:** Get sleep study and file Supplemental Claim
2. **No service connection:** Get nexus letter linking sleep apnea to service-connected condition
3. **Inadequate nexus opinion:** Get stronger nexus letter with more detailed rationale
4. **Sleep apnea predated service-connected condition:** Argue aggravation if sleep apnea worsened after service-connected condition developed

**Appeal options:**
- Supplemental Claim (with new evidence)
- Higher-Level Review (if VA made clear error)
- Board Appeal (if other options unsuccessful)

## Conclusion

Sleep apnea is one of the most commonly claimed VA disabilities, particularly as a secondary condition to PTSD, rhinitis, or other service-connected conditions. While direct service connection is rare, secondary service connection is frequently granted with proper evidence.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Ratings: 0%, 30%, 50%, or 100%
- Most common: 50% for CPAP use ($1,102.04/month)
- Sleep study is required for diagnosis
- Secondary to PTSD, rhinitis, asthma, GERD, hypothyroidism is common pathway
- Nexus letter is critical for secondary claims
- Use CPAP regularly to maintain 50% rating
- File for secondary conditions (hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmias) for additional compensation
