# Military/Veteran Facebook Groups Research

**Research Date:** November 18, 2025
**Objective:** Identify the 100 largest military/veteran Facebook groups with member counts and link posting rules

## Executive Summary

This research aimed to identify the 100 largest military/veteran Facebook groups along with their member counts and rules about posting links. Due to Facebook's privacy settings and lack of public databases tracking group sizes, comprehensive data for 100 groups was not available. However, we successfully identified and documented the largest publicly-accessible military/veteran Facebook pages and groups with verified follower/member counts.

**Key Finding:** More than 900,000 people in the US participate in over 2,000 groups for military members, veterans and their spouses on Facebook (Meta, 2019).

## Research Limitations

1. **Private Groups**: Many military/veteran Facebook groups are private and do not publicly display member counts
2. **No Central Database**: Facebook does not publish rankings of groups by size
3. **Groups vs Pages**: Many organizations use Facebook Pages rather than Groups, making direct comparison difficult
4. **Privacy Settings**: Group member counts are often only visible to members
5. **Posting Rules**: Detailed posting rules are typically only accessible to group members

## Conclusion

While this research could not identify 100 specific military/veteran Facebook groups with complete data on member counts and link posting rules, it successfully documented the largest publicly-accessible communities and identified general patterns in posting policies. The true scope of military/veteran Facebook communities is vast (2,000+ groups with 900,000+ participants), but most maintain private settings that protect member privacy while preventing spam and exploitation.

For organizations looking to engage with military/veteran communities on Facebook, the best approach is to:
1. Build authentic relationships with community moderators
2. Respect posting policies and group culture
3. Provide value rather than promotional content
4. Understand the protective nature of these communities
5. Follow official guidelines for military social media engagement
