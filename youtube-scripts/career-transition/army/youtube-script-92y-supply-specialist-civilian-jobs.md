**Section 1: Your Market Value (90 seconds)**

The corporate world is bleeding for people with supply chain experience. Here's your entry strategy.

[Visual suggestion: Company logos with entry positions]

**Amazon - The Volume Hire**

Amazon hires more veterans into logistics than any company in America. They have dedicated veteran recruiting.

**Positions:**
- Area Manager (L4): $55,000-$65,000/year base + stock + bonus = $75K total
- Operations Manager (L5): $80,000-$95,000/year + stock = $110K+ total
- Senior Operations Manager (L6): $110,000-$135,000 + stock = $150K+ total

**The path:** Start as area manager (they actively recruit 92Ys), hit L5 in 2-3 years, L6 in 5-7 years.

**How to apply:** Amazon Military Jobs website, use the Military Skills Translator tool, it auto-matches 92Y to relevant positions.

**Reality:** You'll work hard. Amazon operations is intense. But the pay is good and promotion is fast if you perform.

- Operations manager: $55,000-$75,000/year
- Assistant manager: $50,000-$65,000/year

- **General Electric:** Supply chain coordinator $60K-$85K

**Section 3: Government Logistics - The High Pay Option (90 seconds)**

Here's what nobody tells 92Ys: Government supply positions pay MORE than corporate for the same work.

[Visual suggestion: Government salary comparison]

**Department of Defense Civilian Positions:**

**Supply Specialist (DoD civilian):**
- Average salary: $106,716/year
- Range: $96,000-$119,000/year
- Locations: Any military installation
- Job series: GS-2001 series

**Unit Supply Specialist (National Guard):**
- Average salary: $114,472/year
- Range: $103,000-$127,000/year
- Work with Guard units as civilian
- Benefits: Federal pension, job security

**Other Federal Logistics Positions:**

**GS-11 Logistics Management Specialist:** $73,000-$95,000/year
**GS-12 Logistics Management Specialist:** $87,000-$113,000/year
**GS-13 Supply Chain Manager:** $103,000-$134,000/year

**How to find these jobs:** USAJobs.gov, search "supply specialist" or "logistics" or "inventory management"

**Veterans' preference:** You get 5 or 10 points added to your score (10 points if you're disabled veteran). This is huge for getting hired.

**Why federal vs corporate:**
- Higher starting pay for 92Y background
- Pension (corporate has 401K only)
- Job security (nearly impossible to fire)
- Clear pay scales and promotion timelines
- Federal holidays off
- Healthcare benefits are excellent

**Why corporate vs federal:**
- Faster hiring (federal takes 6-12 months)
- More locations available
- Potentially faster advancement if you're a top performer
- Less bureaucracy

**Section 4: Defense Contractors - The Clearance Multiplier (60 seconds)**

If you have or can get a security clearance, defense contractor logistics pays premium.

**The trade-off:** You're deployed away from family, but the money is excellent and usually tax-free in combat zones.

**Section 5: Certifications That Multiply Your Salary (90 seconds)**

**Section 6: Resume Translation (60 seconds)**

This is critical. You can't put military jargon on a civilian resume. Here's the translation:

[Visual suggestion: Side-by-side military vs civilian terms]

**DON'T SAY:**
"92Y Unit Supply Specialist, managed hand receipts for 300+ soldiers"

**SAY:**
"Inventory Manager - Managed $4.5M in assets across 15 departments, maintained 99.8% accountability rate"

**DON'T SAY:**
"Conducted layouts and inventories using GCSS-Army"

**SAY:**
"Led quarterly physical inventories and cycle counts using enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems"

**DON'T SAY:**

**DON'T SAY:**
"Property Book Officer maintaining unit MTOE equipment"

**SAY:**
"Asset Management Specialist - Oversaw lifecycle management of organizational assets valued at $8M+"

**Key resume terms that civilian HR looks for:**
- Supply chain management
- Inventory control
- Asset management
- Procurement
- Logistics coordination
- ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, GCSS counts)
- Warehouse operations
- Distribution management
- Vendor relations
