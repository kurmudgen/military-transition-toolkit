[INTRO - 15 seconds]

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
35F with TS/SCI clearance? You're looking at $130K+ jobs. Without clearance? I'll show you how to still hit six figures.

**Context (next 12 seconds):**
Intelligence analysts are in massive demand across government contractors, three-letter agencies, and private sector. I'm breaking down cleared vs non-cleared salaries, which companies are hiring right now, the certifications that matter, and how to maintain your clearance after separation to maximize your value.

[MAIN CONTENT - 7-8 minutes]

**Section 1: Your Market Value (90 seconds)**

Let's talk numbers because 35Fs are some of the highest-paid transitioning veterans right now.

[Visual suggestion: Salary breakdown by clearance level]

**Average 35F civilian salary:** $98,618-$101,201/year

But that average is misleading. Your actual salary depends on three factors:

**Factor 1: Security Clearance**
- No clearance: $74,000-$95,000/year
- Secret clearance: $85,000-$110,000/year
- TS/SCI: $110,000-$177,000/year

**Clearance premium:** 30-50% salary increase for TS/SCI vs non-cleared

**Factor 2: Location**
- DC/Northern Virginia area: $110,000-$155,000/year
- Colorado Springs: $95,000-$130,000/year
- San Antonio/Fort Meade area: $90,000-$125,000/year
- Remote positions: $85,000-$120,000/year

**Factor 3: Specialization**
- All-source analyst: $95,000-$130,000/year
- Cyber threat intelligence analyst: $105,000-$145,000/year
- Counterterrorism analyst: $100,000-$140,000/year
- Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT): $95,000-$135,000/year
- SIGINT analyst: $100,000-$140,000/year

**Critical fact:** 35Fs with TS/SCI clearance in the DC area are seeing starting offers of $110K-$130K right now. Not in 5 years. Right now.

**Section 2: The Clearance Strategy (90 seconds)**

Your security clearance is worth $20,000-$50,000 per year in additional salary. Treat it like gold.

[Visual suggestion: Clearance timeline and rules]

**If you have TS/SCI:**

**Rule #1:** Get a job that uses your clearance within 24 months of separation
- After 24 months without use, clearance goes "inactive"
- Companies have to re-investigate (costs them $5K-$15K)
- You become less attractive to employers

**Rule #2:** Know your investigation date
- Clearances must be renewed every 5 years
- If yours expires in 6 months, some contractors won't hire you
- Best time to transition: 2-4 years into your current clearance cycle

**Rule #3:** Don't screw it up while job hunting
- Financial problems can kill clearances (missed payments, collections)
- Foreign contacts must be reported
- Drug use is disqualifying
- Keep your credit score above 650

**If you don't have a clearance or lost it:**

You can still make $90K+ but you need to pivot to:
- Corporate intelligence analysis
- Cyber threat intelligence (private sector)
- Business intelligence analyst
- Data analyst roles
- Financial crime analyst

These don't require clearance but value your analytical skills.

**Section 3: Defense Contractors (The Cleared Path) (120 seconds)**

If you have clearance, defense contractors are your best bet for immediate $110K+ salary.

**Section 6: Certifications That Matter (60 seconds)**

Unlike some MOSs, certifications are less important for 35F than your clearance and experience. But these help:

[Visual suggestion: Certification list with priority]

**Medium Value:**

- **CISSP:** $750, senior-level positions

**Use DoD COOL:** These certifications are covered through DoD COOL program while you're in or within 180 days of separation.

**Degree matters more:** Many GS-11+ positions require bachelor's degree. Use your GI Bill if you don't have one.
