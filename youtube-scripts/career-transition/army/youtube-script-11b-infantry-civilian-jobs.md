[INTRO - 15 seconds]

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
Transitioning from 11B Infantry? Here's how to land an $80K job in 6 months without a degree.

**Context (next 12 seconds):**
I'm going to show you seven real career paths that actually hire infantry vets, with specific salary ranges, companies actively recruiting, and the exact certifications you need. No fluff. Just the path from boots on ground to six figures.

[MAIN CONTENT - 7-8 minutes]

**Section 1: The Reality Check (60 seconds)**

Let's be honest. You're not going to walk into a $100K job next week. But here's what you need to know: your infantry experience is valuable, just not in the ways you think.

[Visual suggestion: Show stats on screen]

Census Bureau data shows infantry vets have lower initial earnings than tech MOSs. That's the bad news. The good news? You have skills that matter: leadership under pressure, decision-making in chaos, team coordination, and the ability to stay calm when everything's on fire.

The trick is translating those skills into civilian language and picking the right path. Let's talk about the seven best options.

**Section 2: Law Enforcement - The Obvious Choice (90 seconds)**

Let's start with the most common path. Law enforcement loves infantry vets.

[Visual suggestion: Salary comparison chart]

Here's what you're looking at:
- Local police: $61,590 median salary
- State trooper: $67,230 median
- Federal law enforcement: $87,130 median

But here's what nobody tells you: most agencies require a 6-month academy, some college credits, and you'll start on patrol regardless of your rank in the Army.

**Companies actively hiring:**
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection
- DEA
- U.S. Marshals Service
- State police departments (Texas DPS, California Highway Patrol)
- Major city departments (NYPD, LAPD, Chicago PD)

**Requirements:**
- Clean background (no waiverable stuff)
- Physical fitness test
- Usually 60 college credits minimum for federal
- Academy training (agency provides)

**Cost:** Free academy training through hiring agency

**Timeline:** 6-12 months from application to badge

The real advantage? Veterans' preference points and many agencies actively recruiting to fill shortages. Dallas PD is literally running billboards targeting vets right now.

**Section 3: Security Contracting - The High-Pay Option (90 seconds)**

This is where former 11Bs can make serious money fast. But it comes with tradeoffs.

[Visual suggestion: Day rate comparison]

**Domestic security jobs:**
- Armed security officer: $45,000-$65,000/year
- Executive protection specialist: $75,000-$135,000/year
- Security director: $130,000-$160,000/year

**Overseas contracting:**
- Low-risk areas: $450-$600/day
- Medium-risk (West Africa, South America): $800-$1,100/day
- Higher-risk areas: $1,000-$1,400/day

Do the math: $1,000/day × 180 days deployed = $180K/year.

**Top companies hiring infantry vets:**
- CACI (20,000 employees worldwide)
- SOC (Day & Zimmermann subsidiary)
- G4S
- Vectrus (35% prior military workforce)
- Constellis
- Triple Canopy
- Academi

**Requirements:**
- Security clearance helps but not always required
- Clean background
- Physical fitness
- Most want 2+ years military experience
- Some require specialized training (PSD, executive protection)

**Certifications needed:**
- Armed security license (varies by state, $200-$500)
- Executive Protection certification ($2,000-$5,000, but many employers pay)
- First Aid/CPR ($50-$200)

**Reality check:** Overseas contracting means you're gone. A lot. If you have family, this can destroy relationships. But if you're single and want to stack cash for 2-3 years, it's hard to beat.

**Section 4: Skilled Trades - The Underrated Path (90 seconds)**

Here's the path nobody talks about, but it's solid: skilled trades.

[Visual suggestion: Bullet points of trades]

**Best options for infantry backgrounds:**
- Electrician: $60,000-$90,000/year
- HVAC technician: $50,000-$75,000/year
- Plumber: $55,000-$85,000/year
- Heavy equipment operator: $45,000-$70,000/year
- Construction manager: $84,874 average salary

Why does this work for 11Bs? You're used to working with your hands, you understand equipment maintenance, and you can follow procedures exactly.

**The union advantage:**
- IBE W(Electricians): Free apprenticeship, full benefits, pension
- UA (Plumbers): Paid training, $30+/hour as apprentice
- Operating Engineers: Heavy equipment training included

**Timeline:** 4-year apprenticeship, but you're earning from day one. Start at $18-$25/hour, journeyman wage $35-$50/hour.

**Companies hiring:**
- Local union halls (Google "[your city] IBEW")
- Major contractors (Bechtel, Fluor, KBR)
- Utilities (your local power/gas company)

**Cost:** Most apprenticeships are FREE and paid. Yes, you read that right.

**GI Bill hack:** Some trade schools qualify for GI Bill, meaning you can get your housing allowance while in apprenticeship. That's $2,000+/month on top of your apprentice wages.

**Section 5: Operations/Logistics - The Corporate Route (90 seconds)**

You ran convoys, managed supply chains under fire, coordinated movement of people and equipment. That's literally operations management.

[Visual suggestion: Corporate job titles]

**Civilian job translations:**
- Operations manager: $65,000-$95,000/year
- Supply chain coordinator: $55,000-$75,000/year
- Warehouse manager: $58,000-$82,000/year
- Logistics analyst: $60,000-$85,000/year

**Top companies hiring vets for ops roles:**
- Amazon (massive veteran hiring initiative)
- UPS
- FedEx
- Target
- Walmart
- Home Depot
- Any major manufacturing company

**Required certifications:**
- APICS Certified in Production and Inventory Management (CPIM): $1,000-$1,500
- OSHA forklift certification: $50-$150
- Lean Six Sigma Green Belt: Free through Hiring Our Heroes program

**The Amazon path:**
Amazon actively recruits vets for operations leadership roles. They have an internal program that fast-tracks military to management. Starting pay: $55K-$65K, but L5 operations manager (reachable in 2-3 years): $85K-$110K.

**Applications:** Search "Military Skills Translator" on Amazon jobs site. It auto-matches your MOS to positions.

**Section 6: Teaching - The Stable Option (60 seconds)**

Hear me out. If you want stability, benefits, and your summers off, teaching might be the move.

[Visual suggestion: Benefits comparison]

**Median salary:** $60,320/year
- But add in: Full health benefits, pension, 2-3 months off
- Total compensation package often $75K-$85K

**Troops to Teachers program:**
- Helps vets get teaching certification
- Up to $10,000 stipend
- Assistance with state certification requirements
- GI Bill covers education requirements

**Best fits for infantry background:**
- JROTC instructor (no teaching certification required, $45K-$65K)
- Physical education teacher
- History/social studies with bachelor's degree

**Reality:** You'll need a bachelor's degree for most teaching positions. But if you're using GI Bill anyway, this is a path to consider.

**Section 7: Free Certifications You Need to Know About (90 seconds)**

Here's the secret nobody tells you: you don't have to pay for certifications.

[Visual suggestion: List of free programs]

**Free certification programs for vets:**
