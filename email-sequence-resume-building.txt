EMAIL 1: Your Military Resume Is Failing. Here's Why.
Send: Day 0 (upon entering resume building workflow)
Subject Line: Why your resume gets zero callbacks
Preview Text: The one mistake that kills 87% of veteran resumes...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Your resume is getting rejected in 6 seconds.

That's the average time a recruiter spends on an initial resume screen. Six seconds.

**Here's what they see when they look at your resume:**

"Infantry Squad Leader, US Army, 2018-2024"

Translation in their head: "I have no idea what this person did or if they can do this job."

**Next.**

It's not personal. It's not anti-military. They just don't understand military language.

**The #1 mistake veterans make:**

They write their resume for other military people, not for civilian hiring managers.

**Bad resume language:**
- "Supervised 12 personnel in garrison and field environments"
- "Maintained accountability of $1.2M in sensitive equipment"
- "Conducted battle drills and tactical operations"

**What they hear:**
- "Did something with people somewhere"
- "Watched expensive stuff"
- "Military things I don't understand"

**Good resume language:**
- "Led team of 12 in high-pressure operational environments with zero safety incidents"
- "Managed inventory tracking system for $1.2M in assets with 100% accountability over 3 years"
- "Trained team on emergency procedures, reducing response time by 35%"

See the difference?

**Same accomplishments. Different language.**

Over the next 2 weeks, I'm going to show you exactly how to build a resume that actually works.

Not a resume that looks military. A resume that gets interviews.

Let's fix this.

EMAIL 2: Translation—Converting MOS to Civilian Speak
Send: Day 2 at 10:00 AM
Subject Line: What "11B Infantry" means in civilian language
Preview Text: The MOS translation guide that gets interviews...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Your MOS means nothing to civilians.

11B, 68W, 0311, BM2—these are codes that mean everything in the military and absolutely nothing outside it.

**Your job isn't to explain your MOS. It's to translate what you actually did.**

**Let's translate some common positions:**

**Military:** Infantry Squad Leader (11B)
**Civilian:** Operations Team Leader
**What you actually did:** Led 9-person team in complex operations requiring coordination, quick decision-making, and risk management under pressure

**Military:** Combat Medic (68W)
**Civilian:** Emergency Medical Technician / Healthcare Operations
**What you actually did:** Provided emergency medical care in high-stress environments, managed medical supply inventory, trained personnel on life-saving procedures

**Military:** Intelligence Analyst (35F)
**Civilian:** Data Analyst / Intelligence Analyst
**What you actually did:** Analyzed complex datasets, identified patterns and trends, created intelligence reports for leadership decision-making

**Military:** Logistics Specialist (92A)
**Civilian:** Supply Chain Coordinator / Logistics Analyst
**What you actually did:** Managed multi-million dollar supply chain operations, coordinated transportation and distribution, optimized inventory management

**How to translate YOUR position:**

**Step 1:** List what you actually did day-to-day (ignore your rank and title)
**Step 2:** Remove military jargon (no acronyms, no unit names, no formations)
**Step 3:** Focus on transferable skills (leadership, problem-solving, technical skills)
**Step 4:** Use civilian job titles that match those skills

**Use our Military Translation Helper:**

We've got 500+ military positions already translated. Just search your MOS and see civilian equivalents.

Stop saying "I was an 11B." Start saying "I led operational teams in high-risk environments."

That's a language they understand.

EMAIL 3: Quantifying Impact—Numbers That Impress
Send: Day 4 at 11:00 AM
Subject Line: "Led a team" vs "Led team of 12" (guess which wins?)
Preview Text: Why numbers are the most powerful words on your resume...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Here's a secret about recruiters: They love numbers.

Numbers are specific. Numbers are verifiable. Numbers show impact.

**Weak resume bullet:**
"Responsible for team leadership and training"

**Strong resume bullet:**
"Led team of 12, conducted 40+ training sessions, improved readiness scores by 23%"

Which one tells the better story?

**Every accomplishment should have a number.**

**Categories of numbers that matter:**

**1. People managed**
- Led team of X
- Supervised X personnel
- Trained X employees
- Managed X contractors

**2. Money handled**
- Managed $X budget
- Reduced costs by $X or X%
- Responsible for $X in assets
- Generated $X in savings

**3. Time saved/improved**
- Reduced processing time by X%
- Improved efficiency by X hours per week
- Completed project X days ahead of schedule

**4. Volume/Scale**
- Processed X requests per day
- Maintained X pieces of equipment
- Conducted X operations
- Managed X locations

**5. Results achieved**
- Increased performance by X%
- Achieved X% accuracy rate
- Reduced incidents by X%
- Improved scores from X to X

**How to find your numbers:**

Go through your last eval or performance review. Pull out every metric mentioned.

Can't find numbers? Estimate reasonably:
- "How many people did I supervise?" (8-12)
- "How much equipment was I responsible for?" ($500K-$2M)
- "How many operations did we run?" (50+ annually)

**Before and after examples:**

❌ "Managed logistics operations"
✓ "Managed logistics operations supporting 200+ personnel across 3 locations, maintaining 98% inventory accuracy"

❌ "Trained new personnel"
✓ "Trained 25+ new team members, reducing onboarding time from 8 weeks to 5 weeks"

❌ "Maintained equipment"
✓ "Maintained $1.8M in communications equipment with 99% operational readiness over 2 years"

Numbers tell the story. Use them everywhere.

EMAIL 4: ATS Optimization—Getting Past the Robots
Send: Day 6 at 2:00 PM
Subject Line: 75% of resumes never reach human eyes
Preview Text: How to beat the Applicant Tracking System filters...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Your resume isn't being rejected by a person.

It's being rejected by a robot.

**Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan your resume for keywords before a human ever sees it.**

No keywords = No interview.

**Here's how ATS works:**

1. Company posts job description
2. You submit resume
3. ATS scans your resume for keywords from the job description
4. ATS ranks candidates by keyword match
5. Top 25% get sent to a human recruiter
6. Bottom 75% never get seen

**You're probably in the bottom 75%.**

**How to beat ATS:**

**1. Use the exact keywords from the job description**

If the job says "project management," don't say "led projects." Say "project management."

If they say "budgeting," use "budgeting" not "financial management."

Match their language exactly.

**2. Put keywords in multiple places**

- Professional summary
- Skills section
- Work experience bullets
- Education/certifications

The more places you use the keyword, the higher you rank.

**3. Use both acronyms and full terms**

Don't just say "PMP." Say "PMP (Project Management Professional)."

Don't just say "CRM." Say "CRM (Customer Relationship Management)."

ATS might search for either version.

**4. Avoid tables, graphics, headers/footers**

ATS can't read these. Stick to simple formatting.

**5. Use standard section headers**

"Work Experience" not "My Career Journey"
"Education" not "Academic Background"
"Skills" not "What I'm Good At"

**How to find the right keywords:**

Read the job description. Highlight every skill, qualification, or requirement mentioned. Those are your keywords.

Then weave them naturally into your resume.

**Example:**

Job description says: "seeking project manager with experience in agile methodology, stakeholder communication, and budget management."

Your resume better include: "project management," "agile methodology," "stakeholder communication," and "budget management."

**ATS isn't evil. It's just a filter. Learn to pass the filter.**

EMAIL 5: Civilian Format—What Hiring Managers Expect
Send: Day 8 at 10:30 AM
Subject Line: Your resume format is costing you interviews
Preview Text: Military chronological vs civilian functional formats...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Military resumes look different from civilian resumes.

And when a civilian recruiter sees a military-formatted resume? It screams "this person doesn't understand the civilian world."

**What's wrong with military resume format:**

❌ Multiple pages (your military resume is probably 3-5 pages)
❌ Dense paragraphs (walls of text)
❌ Formal language ("subject matter expert," "facilitates")
❌ Awards section that dominates the page
❌ References included (never do this)

**What civilian resumes look like:**

✓ 1-2 pages max (1 page if under 10 years experience)
✓ Bullet points (easy to scan)
✓ Active, conversational language
✓ Awards mentioned briefly if relevant
✓ No references ("available upon request" is outdated)

**The format that works:**

**HEADER**
Name, phone, email, LinkedIn, location (city/state)

**PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY** (3-4 lines)
Who you are, what you do, your key strengths

**WORK EXPERIENCE** (reverse chronological)
Job Title | Company | Dates
- 3-5 bullet points per position
- Focus on achievements, not duties

**EDUCATION**
Degree, School, Year
Relevant certifications

**SKILLS**
Technical skills, software, relevant competencies

**That's it.**

No objectives ("seeking a challenging position where I can grow..."). Nobody cares.

No hobbies unless directly relevant to the job.

No personal info (age, marital status, photo—these are actually illegal considerations in the US).

**Formatting rules:**

- Use standard fonts (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman)
- 10-12pt font size
- 0.5-1 inch margins
- Consistent formatting (if one job title is bold, all should be)
- Bullet points aligned
- No colors, no graphics, no fancy designs

**Length matters:**

If you have 6 years of experience and your resume is 3 pages, you're including too much.

Focus on the last 10 years. Focus on relevant experience. Cut the fluff.

**Your resume is a marketing document, not your life story.**

Include what helps you get the job. Exclude everything else.

EMAIL 6: Cover Letters That Actually Work
Send: Day 10 at 1:00 PM
Subject Line: Do you even need a cover letter in 2025?
Preview Text: Yes—but only if you do it right. Here's how...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

"Do I need a cover letter?"

**Short answer:** Sometimes.

**Long answer:** If the application asks for one, yes. If it doesn't, you probably still should.

**Why cover letters matter:**

They let you tell the story your resume can't. They show you actually want THIS job at THIS company, not just any job.

And most importantly: Most people don't write them. So writing a good one sets you apart.

**What makes a terrible cover letter:**

❌ "I am writing to express my interest in the position..."
(They know why you're writing. Don't waste the opening.)

❌ Three paragraphs that just repeat your resume
(If you're going to repeat your resume, don't write a cover letter)

❌ "I am a hard worker, team player, and quick learner."
(Everyone says this. It means nothing without proof.)

❌ Generic letter that could apply to any company
(Shows you didn't do your research)

**What makes a great cover letter:**

✓ Opens with a hook that shows you understand their problem
✓ Connects your specific experience to their specific needs
✓ Shows you researched the company
✓ Demonstrates enthusiasm for the role
✓ Ends with a clear call to action

**The formula that works:**

**Paragraph 1: The Hook**
"I saw you're expanding your logistics operations into the Southeast region. I spent 5 years managing complex supply chain operations in high-pressure environments—exactly the kind of problem-solving your team needs."

**Paragraph 2: Your Fit**
"In my role as a logistics coordinator in the Marines, I managed $3M in inventory across multiple locations, reduced processing time by 30%, and maintained 99% accuracy. I did this by [specific method] which directly applies to [their need]."

**Paragraph 3: Why Them**
"I'm particularly drawn to [Company] because [specific reason based on research]. Your focus on [company value] aligns with my approach to [relevant skill]."

**Paragraph 4: The Close**
"I'd love to discuss how my logistics background can support your expansion. I'm available for a conversation this week. Thanks for your consideration."

**Keep it to 3-4 short paragraphs. Half a page max.**

If your cover letter is longer than your resume, you've done it wrong.

Body:

You've written your resume. You've translated your experience. You've added numbers. You've optimized for ATS.

□ All dates are accurate (month/year format)

**FORMAT**
□ 1-2 pages max (1 page if <10 years experience)

□ Email address is professional (firstname.lastname@email.com)
□ LinkedIn URL is customized (linkedin.com/in/yourname)

**THE FINAL TEST:**

Give your resume to someone outside the military. Not a veteran. A civilian friend or family member.

Ask them: "What do you think I did for a living?"

If they can't tell you clearly? Your translation isn't done.

**You've built a strong resume. Now make it perfect.**

This is the document that gets you in the door. It's worth getting right.
