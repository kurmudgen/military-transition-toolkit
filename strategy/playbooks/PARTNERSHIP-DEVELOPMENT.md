## Partnership Types & Targets

### Tier 1: Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs)

**Organizations** (Target: 5 partnerships by Month 3):
- VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars)
- American Legion
- DAV (Disabled American Veterans)
- Wounded Warrior Project
- Team Rubicon
- Team Red, White & Blue
- Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)

**Value Proposition**:
```
"Help your members transition to civilian careers successfully"

Problems VSOs Face:
- Limited staff (can't provide 1-on-1 career coaching to all members)
- Members need transition help VSOs can't provide
- Generic resources don't meet individual needs
- Hard to track member transition success

MTT Solution:
- Scalable (your entire membership gets access)
- Personalized (each member gets custom roadmap for their MOS)
- Trackable (you see usage metrics, measure impact)
- Branded (customize with your VSO's branding)
- Affordable ($500-$3,000/month vs hiring transition staff)
```

**Pricing Tiers**:

**Small VSO** (< 1,000 active members): $500/month
- 100 license seats
- Basic customization (logo on platform)
- Monthly usage reports
- Email support

**Medium VSO** (1,000-10,000 members): $1,500/month
- 500 license seats
- Full customization (branding, colors, custom content)
- Quarterly training webinars for VSO staff
- Dedicated slack channel for support
- Priority feature requests

**Large VSO** (10,000+ members): $3,000-$5,000/month

### Tier 2: TAP Programs (Transition Assistance Program)

**Organizations** (Target: 2-3 partnerships by Month 6-9):
- Military installations (Fort Bragg, Camp Pendleton, etc.)
- DoD TAP programs
- National Guard / Reserve TAP programs
- Branch-specific transition programs

**Value Proposition**:
```
"Supplement official TAP curriculum with ongoing support"

Problems TAP Programs Face:
- Limited to 1-2 days of classroom instruction
- No ongoing support after TAP week
- Can't personalize for each service member's MOS
- Hard to track service member progress post-TAP
- No accountability (did they actually find a job?)

MTT Solution:
- Extends TAP beyond classroom (6-24 months of support)
- Personalized for each service member's MOS and timeline
- Tracks progress (completion rates, job placements, outcomes)
- Reporting for command (shows transition readiness metrics)
- Complements (doesn't replace) official TAP
```

**Pricing**: $2,000-$5,000/month per installation
- Based on base size (number of separating service members annually)
- Typically 200-1,000 separations/year per large installation
- Price: $2,000 (small base) to $5,000 (large base)

**Sales Cycle**: 6-12 months (government procurement is slow)
- Start outreach Month 1
- Expect to close Month 9-12

**Revenue Potential** (Long-term: Month 9-12):
- 2 TAP contracts × $3,500/month = $7,000/month ($84K/year)
- Scale to 5-10 contracts in Year 2: $17.5K-$35K/month

### Tier 3: University Career Centers

**Organizations** (Target: 5 partnerships by Month 6):
- Universities with large veteran student populations
- Community colleges with GI Bill programs
- For-profit schools (University of Phoenix, SNHU, WGU)

**Value Proposition**:
```
"Help your veteran students transition to careers successfully"

Problems Universities Face:
- Career centers overwhelmed (100+ veteran students, 1-2 staff)
- Generic career advice doesn't work for veterans
- Hard to connect veterans to military-friendly employers
- Low veteran student success rates hurt retention/reputation

MTT Solution:
- Scalable career support for all veteran students
- Military-specific resources (MOS translation, veteran employers)

- Improves veteran student success metrics
- Supports recruiting (offer to prospective veteran students)
```

**Pricing Models**:

**Model A: Per-Student** ($10/student/semester)

**Model B: Bulk License** ($500-$1,000/month)
- Unlimited student access
- Custom university branding
- Quarterly career workshops on campus

**Revenue Potential**:
- 3 Per-Student universities (avg 300 students): $1,500/month

  - Amazon, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, Deloitte, Accenture, etc.

**Value Proposition**:
```
"Access a pipeline of qualified, transition-ready veteran candidates"

Problems Companies Face:
- Hard to find qualified veteran candidates
- Veterans apply but aren't prepared (resume issues, interview skills)
- High cost-per-hire for veteran recruiting
- Long time-to-hire (veteran skills translation challenges)

MTT Solution:
- Access to 10,000+ veterans actively preparing for transition
- Pre-qualified candidates (already using MTT to prep)
- Faster hiring (candidates already have civilian-ready resumes)
- Lower training costs (candidates understand civilian workplace)
- Brand exposure (promoted to MTT community as military-friendly)
```

**Pricing Models**:

**Model A: Job Board Listing** ($500/month)
- Post unlimited jobs in MTT job database

**Organizations** (Target: 2 partnerships by Month 9):

**Value Proposition**:
```
"Help your state fulfill veteran employment mandate"

Problems States Face:
- State mandate to support veteran employment
- Limited budget for veteran services
- Hard to track outcomes (did veteran get a job?)
- Generic state resources don't drive results

MTT Solution:
- Cost-effective statewide veteran employment support
- Personalized for each veteran's needs
- Tracks outcomes (job placements, salaries, retention)
- Reporting for state legislature (shows ROI of program)
- Branded for your state (shows state investment in veterans)
```

**Pricing**: $1,000-$5,000/month
- Based on state veteran population
- Small state (< 100K veterans): $1,000/month
- Medium state (100K-500K): $2,500/month
- Large state (500K+): $5,000/month

**Sales Cycle**: 9-18 months (state procurement is very slow)

**Subject**: "Help [VSO Name] Members Transition to Civilian Careers"

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], a [rank/branch] veteran and founder of Military Transition
Toolkit.

I've been following [VSO Name]'s work supporting veterans, particularly
[specific program or initiative they run]. Impressive impact.

I built MTT to help service members transition to civilian careers. We've
helped 10,000+ veterans:
- Find careers matching their MOS
- Land jobs paying $10K-$20K more than expected
- Navigate VA benefits
- Use the GI Bill strategically

I'd love to explore a partnership where [VSO Name] members get access to
MTT's platform:

✓ Personalized transition planning for each member's MOS
✓ 1,400+ career guides and resources
✓ 15+ tools (resume builder, salary calculator, job tracker)
✓ Community of transitioning veterans
✓ Usage tracking (measure member engagement and outcomes)

We're currently partnering with [name 1-2 similar VSOs if you have them,
or say "several VSOs"].

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this?

I've attached a one-pager with more details.

Thanks for your consideration, and for your work supporting veterans.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]
[Rank, Branch, Years of Service]
Founder, Military Transition Toolkit
[Phone]
[Email]
[Website]
```

**Demo Structure** (20-30 minutes):

**1. Introduction (2 minutes)**:
- Your story (why you built MTT)
- Your credibility (branch, MOS, transition experience)
- Overview of what you'll cover

**2. Problem Statement (3 minutes)**:
- Challenges veterans face during transition
- Challenges VSOs/TAP/Universities face supporting them
- Why generic resources don't work

**3. Solution Demo (10 minutes)**:
- Live walkthrough of MTT platform
- Show key features:
  - Personalized timeline generation
  - MOS career matcher
  - Resume builder
  - VA claims resources
  - Community
- Emphasize: "This is what your members would see"

**4. Partnership Value (5 minutes)**:
- How it helps their organization:
  - Scalable (support 1,000s of members with limited staff)
  - Trackable (usage reports, outcomes metrics)
  - Branded (customize with their logo/branding)
  - Affordable (cheaper than hiring transition staff)
- Show pricing and packages

**5. Social Proof (2 minutes)**:
- Share testimonials from users
- Reference other partnerships (if you have them)
- Share success metrics ("Avg user finds job paying $55K vs $42K industry avg")

**6. Next Steps (3 minutes)**:
- Answer questions
- Discuss customization needs
- Propose pricing tier
- Timeline for implementation

- Reference their specific pain points (from research)
- Let them drive (ask what they want to see)
- Address objections directly (pricing, implementation, etc.)

---

**Negotiation Tactics**:

**When they say pricing is too high**:
- Emphasize ROI: "If MTT helps 10 of your members get jobs paying $5K more, that's $50K in additional veteran income. Your investment: $6K/year."
- Offer pilot: "Try it with 50 members for 3 months at 50% off. If it works, scale up."
- Show cost comparison: "Hiring 1 FTE transition counselor = $60K/year salary + benefits. MTT = $6K-$18K/year for unlimited members."

**When they say they need to think about it**:
- Ask: "What concerns do you have? Let's address them now."
- Create urgency: "We're offering founding partner pricing (20% off) through end of month."
- Offer references: "Would it help to speak with [other partner] about their experience?"

**When they say they need board approval**:
- Ask: "What does the board need to see to approve this?"
- Offer: "I can join the board meeting to present and answer questions."
- Provide: "Here's a board memo template you can use to propose this."

## Conclusion: Partnerships = Scale

Partnerships allow you to:
1. **Reach thousands** without individual user acquisition
2. **Generate B2B revenue** (higher $ per customer than B2C)
3. **Build credibility** (VSO endorsements = trust)
4. **Create network effects** (partners refer other partners)
5. **Diversify revenue** (less reliant on individual subscriptions)

**The Goal**: 10-20 partnerships generating $10K-$20K MRR while helping 10,000+ veterans through partner channels.

**Start outreach Week 1. Sign first partnership by Week 8. Scale from there.**
