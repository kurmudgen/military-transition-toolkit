## **💡 RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Launch Strategy:**

**Option 1: Early Launch (Recommended)**
- Launch NOW with current content (65% complete)
- Begin contractor outreach immediately
- Start veteran marketing (SEO + paid ads)
- Add remaining content (blog posts, checklists, etc.) over next 4-6 weeks

**Benefits:**
- Start generating revenue immediately
- Test platform with real users
- Iterate based on feedback
- Build momentum and traction

**Option 2: Wait for 100% Completion**
- Complete all remaining content first
- Launch with full site (blog, checklists, FAQs, etc.)
- More comprehensive from day one

**Benefits:**
- More SEO content at launch
- More lead magnets for email capture
- More comprehensive user experience

**Recommendation: Option 1 (Early Launch)**

Why? You have enough content to:
1. Educate veterans about grants (3 landing pages)
2. Connect them with local contractors (4 county pages)
3. Onboard contractors (complete materials ready)
4. Start generating leads and revenue

The remaining 35% of content (blog posts, checklists, etc.) enhances SEO and user experience but isn't required for basic functionality.
