## **Success Stories: San Bernardino County Veterans**

### **Army Veteran, Rancho Cucamonga**
**Grant:** SAH ($95,000)
**Project:** Complete first-floor accessible renovation

*"I chose to retire in Rancho Cucamonga because housing is affordable and it's close to the VA Loma Linda Medical Center. My SAH grant covered a complete renovation—accessible bathroom, kitchen, ramps, and widened doorways. The total cost was $95,000, and the quality of work was excellent. AdaptHome connected me with a contractor who understood VA regulations and kept me informed throughout the 4-month project."*

—Captain David Martinez, USA (Ret.), Rancho Cucamonga

---

### **Navy Veteran, Victorville**
**Grant:** SHA ($18,500)
**Project:** Accessible bathroom remodel

*"Living in the High Desert, I was worried about finding a quality contractor. AdaptHome matched me with a Victorville contractor who specializes in VA grants. He built a beautiful roll-in shower, installed grab bars, and widened my bathroom door. The total cost was $18,500—well under my $20,929 SHA grant. I used the leftover funds to install handrails on my stairs. Great experience."*

—Petty Officer Second Class Michael Johnson, USN (Ret.), Victorville

---

### **Marine Veteran, Big Bear Lake**
**Grant:** HISA ($6,200)
**Project:** Mountain home ramp and safety features

*"Living in Big Bear presents unique challenges—snow, elevation, access. I needed a wheelchair ramp built to handle snow loads and mountain weather. AdaptHome found me a contractor who specializes in mountain homes. He built a sturdy composite ramp with heated non-slip treads and installed grab bars throughout my home. Total cost: $6,200, all covered by HISA. Perfect for mountain living."*

—Corporal Robert Anderson, USMC (Ret.), Big Bear Lake

## **Unique San Bernardino County Considerations**

### **High Desert Climate**

Victorville, Hesperia, Apple Valley, and surrounding High Desert communities have unique needs:

**Extreme Temperature Swings:**
- Summer: 100°F+ daytime, 60°F nights
- Winter: Below freezing at night, 50°F days
- Materials must handle expansion/contraction
- HVAC considerations for accessible spaces

**Wind & Dust:**
- High winds common (30-50 mph gusts)
- Dust storms (contractors use extra protection)
- Ramps and outdoor structures must be wind-resistant
- Air filtration important for accessible homes

**High Desert Contractors Know:**
- Best materials for desert climate
- Proper sealing and weatherproofing
- Dust control during construction
- Seasonal scheduling (avoid extreme summer heat)

---

### **Mountain Communities**

Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead, Running Springs, and other mountain areas have special requirements:

**Snow Load Considerations:**
- Ramps must be designed for snow weight
- Roof modifications must handle heavy snow
- Heated non-slip surfaces for safety
- Covered entry ways to prevent ice buildup

**Access Challenges:**
- Limited contractor availability (may need to bring contractors from lower elevations)
- Weather-dependent timelines (winter delays)
- Material delivery challenges (narrow mountain roads)
- Higher costs (travel time, specialized materials)

**Mountain Contractors Provide:**
- Snow load engineering
- Seasonal scheduling (summer construction preferred)
- Weather-resistant materials
- Heated ramp systems

---

### **Affordability Advantage**

**San Bernardino County has the LOWEST costs in Southern California:**

**Cost Comparison Example (Accessible Bathroom):**
- **San Bernardino County:** $12,000-$16,000
- **Riverside County:** $14,000-$18,000
- **Orange County:** $18,000-$24,000
- **San Diego County:** $16,000-$22,000

**Why?**
- Lower overhead for contractors
- Lower labor costs
- More competitive market
- Lower permit fees

**Your $20,929 SHA grant can cover MORE in San Bernardino County:**
- Bathroom remodel ($14,000) + Exterior ramp ($4,000) + Widened doorways ($2,000) = **$20,000** total
- Same project in Orange County would cost $27,000-$32,000 (exceeds grant)
