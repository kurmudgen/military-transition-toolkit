## **What is the HISA Grant?**

This grant can be used to **install grab bars, build ramps, modify bathroom entry, improve accessibility to essential facilities,** and other safety modifications—making your daily life easier and safer.

---

## **Quick Overview**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Grant Amount** | Up to $6,976 (2025 FY) |
| **Can Use** | Once per benefit period |
| **Use For** | Home improvements for accessibility and safety |

| **Application** | VA Form 10-0103 or through VA healthcare provider |
| **Processing Time** | 30-60 days |

## **Who is Eligible for the HISA Grant?**

The HISA grant has **broader eligibility** than SAH or SHA grants:

✅ **Any veteran receiving VA healthcare** for a **service-connected or non-service-connected disability**

✅ **No specific disability rating required** (unlike SAH/SHA)

✅ **Modifications must be medically necessary** (determined by VA healthcare provider)

✅ **Modifications must improve access** to home or essential facilities

### **HISA is Easier to Qualify For**

Unlike SAH ($104,648) and SHA ($20,929) grants which have strict disability requirements, HISA is available to a much wider range of veterans. If you're receiving VA healthcare and need home modifications for accessibility or safety, you likely qualify.

This amount is **adjusted annually** for cost-of-living increases.

---

### **Step 5: Complete the Work**

- **Hire a licensed contractor** (required)
- **Obtain permits if needed** (usually not required for minor modifications like grab bars)
- **Complete the work** according to approved specifications
- **VA may inspect** (not always required for HISA)

---

### **Step 6: Get Reimbursed**

### **How is HISA different from SAH and SHA grants?**

| Feature | HISA | SHA | SAH |
|---------|------|-----|-----|
| **Amount** | Up to $6,976 | Up to $20,929 | Up to $104,648 |

| **Can Use** | Once per benefit period | Up to 6 times | Up to 3 times |
| **Application** | VA Form 10-0103 | VA Form 26-4555 | VA Form 26-4555 |

---

### **Can I use HISA for a rental home?**

**Yes**, in some cases. You can use HISA for modifications to a rental property if:
- You have your landlord's written permission
- The modifications are medically necessary
- You plan to live there as your primary residence

**Note:** You may need to remove modifications when you move (or forfeit security deposit).

---

### **Do I need a VA disability rating to qualify?**

**No.** Unlike SAH and SHA, HISA does **not** require a specific disability rating. You just need to be receiving VA healthcare and have a medically necessary need for modifications.

---

### **Can I do the work myself (DIY)?**

**Generally, no.** VA requires that most HISA work be completed by licensed contractors. However, very minor modifications (like installing a grab bar) may be eligible for DIY if you can demonstrate competency and provide documentation.

**Recommendation:** Use a licensed contractor to ensure:
- Work is done safely and to code
- VA will approve reimbursement
- Work is covered by warranty

---

### **How long does HISA approval take?**

**Typically 30-60 days** from submission to approval, assuming your application is complete and medical necessity is clear.

**Tips to speed up approval:**
- Submit complete application with all required documentation
- Include contractor quotes upfront
- Work with your VA social worker or case manager
- Respond quickly to any VA requests for additional info

---

### **What if my project costs more than $6,976?**

You can pay the difference out-of-pocket or through other funding:
- Personal savings
- Credit card or personal loan
- Home equity line of credit (HELOC)
- Charitable organizations (some veteran charities help with home modifications)

Many contractors offer payment plans for the amount exceeding the grant.

---

### **Can I combine HISA with SAH or SHA grants?**

**No.** HISA is for veterans who **do not qualify** for SAH or SHA. If you're eligible for SAH or SHA (higher grant amounts), you should apply for those instead.

---

### **Does HISA need to be repaid?**

**No.** HISA is a grant (not a loan) and does **not** need to be repaid.

---

### **Can I apply for HISA if I already used SAH or SHA?**

**It depends.** If you've used your SAH or SHA benefits and still need additional modifications, you may be eligible for HISA. Talk to your VA social worker to determine eligibility.

## **Tips for Maximizing Your HISA Grant**

### **1. Prioritize Safety Over Aesthetics**

Focus on modifications that will have the biggest impact on your safety and independence:
- **Grab bars** (prevent falls)
- **Ramps** (safe entry/exit)
- **Non-slip flooring** (reduce fall risk)

Save decorative upgrades for personal funds.

---

### **2. Bundle Projects for Better Pricing**

Contractors often offer discounts when you bundle multiple projects:
- Install grab bars in bathroom AND handrails on stairs in one visit
- Build ramp and widen door during same project
- Replace flooring in multiple rooms at once

---

### **3. Get Multiple Quotes**

Don't accept the first quote:
- Get at least 2-3 quotes from different contractors
- Compare scope of work and materials
- Ask about warranties and guarantees
- Check references and reviews

**AdaptHome makes this easy** by connecting you with pre-screened contractors.

---

### **4. Use Quality Materials**

Don't cheap out on safety features:
- **Grab bars:** Choose commercial-grade with 500+ lb capacity
- **Ramps:** Use durable materials (aluminum or composite last longer than wood)
- **Non-slip flooring:** Invest in textured tile or rubberized surfaces that last

Quality materials prevent future problems and save money long-term.

---

### **5. Think Long-Term**

Will your needs change as you age or if your condition worsens?
- Install grab bars in locations you might need in the future
- Build ramps with gradual slopes (easier to use long-term)
- Choose modifications that add value (accessible bathrooms help resale)
