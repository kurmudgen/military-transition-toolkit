## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How long does it take to get approved?**

Typically **30-90 days** from the date you submit your complete application. Processing times vary by region and application volume.

### **Can I use the SAH grant with a VA home loan?**

**Yes!** You can combine the SAH grant with a VA home loan to purchase an adapted home or build a new accessible home.

### **Do I have to own the home?**

Not necessarily. You can use the SAH grant to:
- Adapt a home you already own
- Adapt a home you're purchasing
- Adapt a home owned by a family member (if you'll live there)

### **Can I do the work myself (DIY)?**

**No.** VA requires that all work be completed by **licensed contractors**. This ensures quality, safety, and compliance with building codes.

### **What if my project costs more than the grant amount?**

You can pay the difference out-of-pocket or through other financing options (personal loan, home equity line of credit, etc.). Many veterans combine the SAH grant with personal funds for upgrades.

### **Does the grant need to be repaid?**

**No!** The SAH grant does **not** need to be repaid. It is a benefit, not a loan.

### **Can I use the grant for a rental property?**

No. The home must be your **primary residence**. It cannot be used for investment or rental properties.

### **What if I move?**

If you sell the home or no longer use it as your primary residence, you may be required to repay a portion of the grant (depending on circumstances). Consult with the VA before moving.

### **Can the grant be used for cosmetic upgrades?**

No. The grant must be used for **necessary adaptations related to your service-connected disability**. Cosmetic upgrades (luxury fixtures, landscaping, etc.) are not covered, but you can pay for them separately.

### **What if my disability gets worse and I need more modifications?**

You can apply for the SAH grant again (up to 3 times lifetime) as long as you haven't exceeded the maximum grant amount.
