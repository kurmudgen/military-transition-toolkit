## **Success Stories: Orange County Veterans**

### **Army Veteran, Irvine**
**Grant:** SAH ($102,000)
**Project:** Complete first-floor accessible renovation with smart home technology

*"After my injury in Afghanistan, I needed extensive home modifications. The SAH grant covered a complete bathroom renovation, accessible kitchen, and smart home system. AdaptHome matched me with a contractor who specializes in high-tech accessibility. My Irvine home is now fully voice-controlled, with automated doors, lighting, and climate control. The contractor understood VA requirements and delivered amazing work."*

—Captain Michael Chen, USA (Ret.), Irvine

### **Navy Veteran, Huntington Beach**
**Grant:** SHA ($20,500)
**Project:** Luxury accessible bathroom with ocean-view roll-in shower

AdaptHome connected me with a contractor who designed a beautiful roll-in shower with frameless glass and custom tile. The project came in at $20,500—just within my SHA grant. The contractor handled coastal commission permits, which can be tricky in HB."*

—Lieutenant Commander Sarah Martinez, USN (Ret.), Huntington Beach

### **Marine Veteran, Mission Viejo**
**Grant:** HISA ($6,800)

—Gunnery Sergeant Robert Johnson, USMC (Ret.), Mission Viejo
