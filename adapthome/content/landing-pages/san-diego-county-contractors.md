## **Success Stories: San Diego Veterans**

### **Marine Corps Veteran, Oceanside**
**Grant:** SAH ($98,000)
**Project:** Complete first-floor conversion with accessible bathroom, kitchen, and elevator

*"After my spinal cord injury in Iraq, I thought I'd never be able to live independently again. The VA SAH grant allowed me to renovate my Oceanside home with a roll-in shower, lowered kitchen counters, and a home elevator. AdaptHome connected me with a fantastic contractor who understood VA requirements and completed the project in 4 months. I can now live comfortably in my own home."*

—Staff Sergeant James Rodriguez, USMC (Ret.), Oceanside

---

### **Navy Veteran, Chula Vista**
**Grant:** SHA ($19,500)
**Project:** Accessible bathroom remodel with roll-in shower

*"I was overwhelmed trying to find a contractor who understood VA grants. AdaptHome made it so easy—they connected me with three contractors in Chula Vista, all with VA grant experience. I chose one who gave me a detailed proposal within 48 hours. The bathroom remodel took 3 weeks and came in under budget. Highly recommend AdaptHome!"*

—Petty Officer First Class Maria Gonzalez, USN (Ret.), Chula Vista

---

### **Army Veteran, El Cajon**
**Grant:** HISA ($6,500)
**Project:** Exterior ramp and bathroom grab bars

*"The HISA grant process was confusing until I found AdaptHome. They explained everything clearly and connected me with a contractor who built a beautiful concrete ramp and installed grab bars in my bathroom. The whole project took 2 weeks, and the contractor handled all the permits. Easy and stress-free."*

—Sergeant First Class David Thompson, USA (Ret.), El Cajon
