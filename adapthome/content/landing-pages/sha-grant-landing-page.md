## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How long does it take to get approved?**

Typically **30-90 days** from the date you submit your complete application. Processing times vary by region and application volume.

### **Can I use the SHA grant to adapt a family member's home?**

**Yes**, if you plan to live there as your primary residence. The family member must agree to the adaptations, and you must have documentation showing it will be your primary residence.

### **Do I have to own the home?**

Not necessarily. You can use the SHA grant to:
- Adapt a home you own
- Adapt a home you're purchasing
- Adapt a home owned by a family member (if you'll live there)
- In some cases, adapt a rental home (with landlord approval)

### **Can I do the work myself (DIY)?**

**No.** VA requires that all work be completed by **licensed contractors**. This ensures quality, safety, and compliance with building codes.

### **What if my project costs more than the grant amount?**

You can pay the difference out-of-pocket or through other financing options (personal loan, home equity line of credit, credit card, etc.). Many veterans use the SHA grant for the major work and pay for upgrades separately.

### **Does the grant need to be repaid?**

**No!** The SHA grant does **not** need to be repaid. It is a benefit, not a loan.

### **Can I use the SHA grant with a VA home loan?**

**Yes!** You can combine the SHA grant with a VA home loan to purchase an adapted home.

### **What if I move or sell the home?**

If you sell the home or no longer use it as your primary residence within a certain timeframe, you may be required to repay a portion of the grant. Consult with the VA before moving.

### **Can the grant be used for cosmetic upgrades?**

**No.** The grant must be used for **necessary adaptations related to your service-connected disability**. Cosmetic upgrades (decorative tiles, luxury fixtures, landscaping) are not covered, but you can pay for them separately.

### **What's the difference between SHA and SAH grants?**

| Feature | SHA Grant | SAH Grant |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Amount** | Up to $20,929 | Up to $104,648 |
| **Eligible Disabilities** | Blindness in both eyes, loss of use of both hands, severe burns | Loss/loss of use of both legs, blindness + loss of one leg, severe disabilities |
| **Use For** | Home adaptations only | New construction OR adaptations |
| **Can Use** | Up to 6 times | Up to 3 times |

### **Can I apply for both SHA and SAH grants?**

**No.** You can only receive one grant type (either SHA or SAH), not both. Your disability determines which grant you're eligible for.

## **Tips for Maximizing Your SHA Grant**

### **1. Prioritize Safety and Function Over Aesthetics**

Focus your $20,929 on critical accessibility features first:
- Accessible bathroom (shower, toilet, sink)
- Safe entry/exit (ramps, widened doors)
- Kitchen modifications if budget allows

Save cosmetic upgrades (decorative tiles, luxury fixtures) for personal funds.

---

### **2. Get Multiple Contractor Quotes**

Don't accept the first quote you receive:
- Get at least 3 quotes from qualified contractors
- Compare scope of work, not just price
- Ask about VA grant experience
- Check references and reviews

**AdaptHome makes this easy** by connecting you with 2-3 pre-screened contractors.

---

### **3. Plan for Future Needs**

Think long-term when planning modifications:
- Will your disability get worse over time?
- Do you plan to age in this home?
- Are there other family members with accessibility needs?

Consider "future-proofing" your home with universal design principles.

---

### **4. Combine Projects to Save Money**

Contractors often offer discounts for bundled work:
- Do bathroom AND kitchen in one project (save on mobilization costs)
- Install multiple ramps at once (save on materials and labor)
- Widen all doorways during one visit (more efficient)

---

### **5. Use Quality Materials That Last**

Don't cheap out on critical safety features:
- Invest in high-quality grab bars (500+ lb weight capacity)
- Use durable non-slip flooring (won't wear out quickly)
- Choose commercial-grade fixtures (handles frequent use)
- Get proper waterproofing in bathrooms (prevent mold and damage)

Quality materials save money in the long run.

---

### **6. Document Everything**

Keep meticulous records for VA reimbursement:
- Take before, during, and after photos
- Save all receipts and invoices
- Keep copies of permits and inspections
- Document any changes to original plans

Organized documentation speeds up reimbursement.
