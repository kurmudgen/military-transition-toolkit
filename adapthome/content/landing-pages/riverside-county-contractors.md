## **Success Stories: Riverside County Veterans**

### **Air Force Veteran, Palm Springs**
**Grant:** SAH ($98,500)
**Project:** Complete desert home renovation with pool lift

*"After my service-related injury, I retired to Palm Springs for the warm climate. My SAH grant allowed me to renovate my entire home—accessible bathroom with custom tile, lowered kitchen counters, and a pool lift so I can enjoy the pool year-round. AdaptHome connected me with a contractor who specializes in desert homes and understands the unique challenges (extreme heat, dust, etc.). The work is absolutely stunning."*

—Major Lisa Anderson, USAF (Ret.), Palm Springs

---

### **Marine Veteran, Temecula**
**Grant:** SHA ($19,200)
**Project:** Accessible bathroom and widened doorways

*"I love living in Temecula Wine Country. When I needed home modifications, I was worried about finding a contractor who could work within my $20,929 SHA grant budget. AdaptHome matched me with a local Temecula contractor who gave me a fair price and excellent quality. My bathroom is beautiful, with a roll-in shower and grab bars, plus widened doorways throughout the house. Total cost was $19,200—under budget!"*

—Sergeant Robert Williams, USMC (Ret.), Temecula

---

### **Army Veteran, Riverside**
**Grant:** HISA ($6,400)
**Project:** Concrete ramp and bathroom safety features

*"The HISA grant was perfect for my needs—I just needed a ramp and some bathroom grab bars. AdaptHome connected me with a Riverside contractor who built a solid concrete ramp and installed commercial-grade grab bars. The whole project took 10 days and cost $6,400. Easy process, great contractor."*

—Staff Sergeant James Garcia, USA (Ret.), Riverside

## **Unique Riverside County Considerations**

### **Desert Climate (Coachella Valley)**

Contractors in Palm Springs, Palm Desert, and surrounding desert cities have special expertise:

**Extreme Heat Challenges:**
- Work schedules (start early, finish by noon during summer)
- Material selection (heat-resistant, UV-resistant)
- HVAC considerations (cooling accessible spaces)
- Outdoor modifications (shaded ramps, covered entries)

**Desert-Specific Features:**
- Pool accessibility (very common in desert)
- Outdoor living space modifications
- Dust control during construction
- Water-efficient landscaping (accessible desert gardens)

---

### **Mountain Communities (Idyllwild, etc.)**

Higher elevation communities have different needs:
- Snow load requirements for ramps
- Heating considerations (accessible radiant heat)
- Limited contractor availability (may need to bring contractors from lower elevations)
- Longer timelines (weather-dependent)

---

### **Affordability Advantage**

**Riverside County is more affordable than coastal counties:**

**Why costs are lower:**
- Lower labor rates ($50-$80/hour vs. $75-$125 in Orange County)
- Lower cost of living
- Less regulatory burden (faster permits, lower fees)
- More competitive market (more contractors, less demand)

**Your VA grant goes further in Riverside County.** A $20,929 SHA grant might only cover a basic bathroom in Orange County, but in Riverside, it can cover a bathroom remodel PLUS ramp installation.

---

### **Wine Country Living (Temecula Valley)**

Temecula, Murrieta, and Menifee offer:
- Newer homes (many built in 2000s, easier to modify)
- Larger lot sizes (more room for ramps, accessible ADUs)
- Family-friendly communities
- Affordable prices (20-30% lower than coastal areas)

---

## **Riverside County Contractor Specializations**

### **Desert Home Specialists (Coachella Valley)**

Contractors who understand desert living:
- Heat management and cooling systems
- Pool and spa accessibility
- Outdoor shade structures
