# AdaptHome Contractor Email Outreach Sequence

## 7-Email Drip Campaign for Contractor Acquisition

---

## **Email 1: Cold Outreach Introduction**
### **Send:** Day 1 (Initial Contact)
### **Subject:** Are you tired of low-quality HomeAdvisor leads?

**Email Body:**

Hi [Contractor Name],

I came across [Company Name] while researching accessibility contractors in [County], and I'm impressed by your work in [specific specialization - bathrooms/ramps/etc.].

I wanted to reach out because we're launching **AdaptHome**, a lead generation platform specifically for contractors working with **VA adaptive housing grants**.

**Here's why this might interest you:**

✅ **Pre-funded leads**: Every veteran has an approved VA grant ($6,976 to $104,648)
✅ **Verified before you pay**: We confirm grant approval, so you're not wasting time on tire-kickers
✅ **Exclusive or limited competition**: You're not bidding against 6 other contractors
✅ **Higher close rates**: 45-55% average (vs. 10-20% on HomeAdvisor)

**The problem we're solving:**

You've probably spent thousands on shared leads from HomeAdvisor or Angi, only to find that:
- Veterans are "just shopping around"
- You're competing with 4-6 other contractors
- Funding isn't secured (they're hoping for a loan)
- Close rates are dismal (10-20% if you're lucky)

**AdaptHome is different.** We only send you leads for veterans who have **already been approved** for VA grants and are ready to start their projects.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to learn more?

I've attached a one-pager with more details. No obligation—just wanted to introduce you to a better way to grow your business.

## **Email 2: Case Study & ROI**
### **Send:** Day 3 (If no response to Email 1)
### **Subject:** How this San Diego contractor made $89,800 from AdaptHome in 6 months

**Email Body:**

Hi [Contractor Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from a couple days ago about AdaptHome—our new lead platform for VA adaptive housing grant projects.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. **Let me show you the numbers from a real contractor** who joined AdaptHome earlier this year:

---

### **Case Study: Accessible Home Solutions (San Diego)**

**6-Month Results:**
- **Leads purchased**: 12 leads (8 SAH, 4 SHA)
- **Total lead cost**: $7,600
- **Projects closed**: 7 (4 SAH, 3 SHA)
- **Close rate**: 58%
- **Total project revenue**: $487,000
- **Estimated profit (20% margin)**: $97,400
- **Net profit after lead costs**: **$89,800**

**ROI: 1,182%**

---

**What made him successful?**

1. **Fast response times** (called veterans within 1 hour)
2. **VA grant expertise** (knew the rules and regulations)
3. **Professional proposals** (detailed, transparent, veteran-focused)
4. **High-quality work** (led to referrals and repeat business)

**Here's what he told us:**

*"I tried HomeAdvisor for 2 years and never saw results like this. AdaptHome leads are pre-qualified, funded, and ready to go. My close rate went from 15% to 58%. Best decision I've made for my business."*

## **Email 3: Comparison - AdaptHome vs. HomeAdvisor/Angi**
### **Send:** Day 6 (If no response to Email 2)
### **Subject:** AdaptHome vs. HomeAdvisor: Here's the honest comparison

**Email Body:**

Hi [Contractor Name],

I get it—you're probably skeptical about another "lead generation platform." You've tried HomeAdvisor, maybe Angi or Thumbtack, and the results have been... underwhelming.

So let me be completely transparent about how AdaptHome compares:

---

### **Side-by-Side Comparison**

| **Feature** | **HomeAdvisor/Angi** | **AdaptHome** |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Lead Cost** | $50-$200 | $400-$800 |
| **Competitors per Lead** | 4-6 contractors | Exclusive or 1-2 max |
| **Funding Verified** | No | Yes (VA grant approved) |
| **Average Project Size** | $500-$50,000 (wide range) | $6,976-$104,648 (predictable) |
| **Close Rate** | 10-20% | 45-60% |
| **Lead Quality** | Mixed (tire-kickers common) | Pre-qualified (ready to start) |
| **Monthly Fees** | Often required | None |
| **Contracts** | Yes (hard to cancel) | No (cancel anytime) |

---

**Yes, our leads cost more upfront. Here's why they're worth it:**

**Scenario 1: HomeAdvisor**
- 10 leads at $150 each = **$1,500**
- Close rate: 15% = **1.5 projects** (maybe 1-2)
- Average project value: $25,000
- Revenue from 1-2 projects: $25,000-$50,000
- Profit (20% margin): $5,000-$10,000
- **Net profit after leads: $3,500-$8,500**

**Scenario 2: AdaptHome**
- 3 SAH leads at $800 each = **$2,400**
- Close rate: 50% = **1.5 projects** (1-2)
- Average project value: $95,000
- Revenue from 1-2 projects: $95,000-$190,000
- Profit (20% margin): $19,000-$38,000
- **Net profit after leads: $16,600-$35,600**

**AdaptHome delivers 2-4x the ROI**, even though individual leads cost more.

---

**The difference?**

- **Quality over quantity**: We send you fewer, better leads
- **Pre-funded**: No "I'm just getting estimates" time-wasters
- **Exclusive options**: Less competition = higher close rates
- **Specialized niche**: VA grant projects are substantial and well-defined

---

**Ready to see for yourself?**

Sign up for AdaptHome and get your **first lead free**. If it doesn't convert, you've lost nothing. If it converts, you've gained a $10,000+ profit project.

## **Email 4: Limited-Time Offer (Create Urgency)**
### **Send:** Day 10 (If no response to Email 3)
### **Subject:** Only 5 spots left for [County] contractors (First lead free)

**Email Body:**

Hi [Contractor Name],

Quick update—we're limiting the number of contractors we onboard in [County] to ensure lead quality and manageable competition.

**Currently, we have 5 spots remaining for [County].**

Once we hit our cap, we'll have a waitlist (likely 3-6 months before we open up again).

---

**Why we're capping enrollment:**

1. **Lead supply**: We have ~40-60 veteran leads per month in [County]. Too many contractors = not enough leads for everyone.
2. **Quality control**: We want our contractors to succeed. Overcrowding the platform hurts everyone.
3. **Exclusivity value**: Limited contractors = better close rates for you.

---

**Here's what you get if you sign up in the next 7 days:**

✅ **First lead free** ($400-$800 value)
✅ **Priority placement** (your profile shown first to veterans)
✅ **1-on-1 onboarding call** with our Contractor Success team
✅ **Access to our VA Grant Compliance Library** ($297 value)

**Total value: $700-$1,100**

---

**Sign up now before spots fill up:**

👉 www.adapthome.com/contractor-signup

Setup takes less than 10 minutes. You could have your first lead by next week.

---

**Still on the fence?**

I get it. Here are the most common questions I hear:

**Q: What if the lead doesn't convert?**
A: You don't pay for the project outcome, just the lead. But with 45-55% average close rates, you'll close far more than you miss.

**Q: Are there contracts or monthly fees?**
A: Nope. Pay only for leads you accept. Cancel anytime. Zero commitment.

**Q: How do I know lead quality will be good?**
A: We verify every veteran's VA grant approval before sending the lead. Plus, your first lead is free—test it out risk-free.

**Q: What if I'm too busy for more leads right now?**
A: You can pause your account anytime. Lock in your spot now, start receiving leads when you're ready.

**Don't miss out.**

5 spots left in [County]. First come, first served.

## **Email 6: Final Follow-Up (Last Chance)**
### **Send:** Day 18 (If no response to Email 5)
### **Subject:** Last call - Should I close your file?

**Email Body:**

Hi [Contractor Name],

I wanted to reach out one last time before I close your file.

I've sent you a few emails about AdaptHome over the past couple weeks, but I haven't heard back. That's totally fine—I know you're busy, and maybe now isn't the right time.

**Before I close your file, I wanted to ask:**

1. **Not interested?** No problem. Just reply with "Not interested" and I'll remove you from this sequence. No hard feelings.

2. **Interested, but bad timing?** Reply with "Follow up in [X months]" and I'll check back in with you then.

3. **Interested, but have questions?** Reply with your questions or schedule a call: [CALENDAR LINK]

4. **Ready to sign up?** Go ahead and register here: www.adapthome.com/contractor-signup

---

**If I don't hear from you, I'll assume you're not interested** and I won't email you again about AdaptHome.

But I wanted to leave you with this:

**What other contractors are saying:**

*"I wish I had signed up sooner. In my first month, I got 3 leads and closed 2 of them. That's $42,000 in revenue from $1,200 in lead costs. Best ROI I've ever seen."*
— David Thompson, Veterans First Remodeling (Oceanside)

*"AdaptHome has completely changed my business. I used to chase leads on HomeAdvisor and waste hours on estimates that went nowhere. Now, I only work with veterans who have funding and are ready to start. Game-changer."*
— Jennifer Chen, Golden State Accessibility (Orange County)

*"As a veteran-owned business, I love working with other veterans. AdaptHome makes it so easy to connect with veterans who need our services and have the VA grant funding to get it done. Highly recommend."*
— Michael Rodriguez, Accessible Home Solutions (San Diego)

This offer expires in **3 days**. After that, new contractors pay full price for their first lead.
