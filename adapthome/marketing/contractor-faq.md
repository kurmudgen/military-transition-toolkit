# AdaptHome Contractor FAQ
## Frequently Asked Questions for Contractors

---

### **1. How does AdaptHome verify that veterans have VA grants?**

**Answer:**

AdaptHome uses a multi-step verification process to ensure all veterans have legitimate VA grant approvals:

- **Grant Approval Documentation**: Veterans upload their official VA grant approval letter when registering
- **VA Database Cross-Reference**: We verify grant details against VA records (with veteran permission)
- **Expiration Date Tracking**: Grants must be active and not expired
- **Funding Confirmation**: We confirm the grant amount and remaining balance
- **Contact Verification**: We verify veteran contact information and VA facility assignment

**You will never receive a lead for a veteran who hasn't been verified through this process.**

Additionally, each lead includes:
- Copy of VA grant approval letter (with sensitive info redacted)
- Grant type (SAH, SHA, or HISA)
- Grant amount and remaining balance
- Approval date and expiration date
- Assigned VA facility

---

### **2. What is the average project size from these leads?**

**Answer:**

Project sizes vary by grant type:

**HISA Grants (Home Improvements & Structural Alterations)**
- **Average Grant Amount**: $6,500
- **Average Project Cost**: $5,000-$7,000
- **Common Projects**: Grab bars, small ramps, accessible entry modifications, bathroom safety features

**SHA Grants (Special Housing Adaptation)**
- **Average Grant Amount**: $19,500
- **Average Project Cost**: $18,000-$21,000
- **Common Projects**: Bathroom remodels, kitchen modifications, widened doorways, interior ramps

**SAH Grants (Special Adaptive Housing)**
- **Average Grant Amount**: $95,000
- **Average Project Cost**: $85,000-$105,000
- **Common Projects**: Complete home renovations, new accessible construction, elevator installation, multi-room modifications

**Additional Revenue Opportunities:**
- **30-40% of veterans** want upgrades beyond the grant amount and pay out-of-pocket
- **Average out-of-pocket spending**: $5,000-$15,000 for upgrades (luxury fixtures, expanded scope, etc.)
- **Repeat business**: Veterans may receive grant adjustments or additional grants for new needs

---

### **3. Do I compete with other contractors for the same lead?**

**Answer:**

This depends on your **lead exclusivity preference**:

**Shared Leads (Standard)**
- Lead sent to **2-3 contractors** in your area
- **Standard pricing**: $400 (HISA) | $600 (SHA) | $800 (SAH)
- **Close rate**: 30-40%
- Best for: Competitive bidders who excel at sales and customer service

**Limited Exclusivity (Recommended)**
- Lead sent to **you + 1 other contractor**
- **Pricing**: +25% premium
- **Close rate**: 45-55%
- Best for: Contractors who want better odds without paying full exclusivity premium

**Full Exclusivity**
- **You are the ONLY contractor** to receive the lead
- **Pricing**: +50% premium
- **Close rate**: 60-70%
- Best for: Established contractors who want maximum close rates

**You choose your exclusivity level** when setting up your profile. You can change it anytime.

---

### **4. How quickly do I need to respond to a lead?**

**Answer:**

**4-hour response window (first contact attempt)**

Speed is critical in lead conversion. Our data shows:
- **Respond within 1 hour**: 65% close rate
- **Respond within 4 hours**: 55% close rate
- **Respond within 24 hours**: 35% close rate
- **Respond after 24 hours**: 20% close rate

**What "response" means:**
- Phone call (preferred)
- Email with specific appointment times
- Text message (if veteran provided mobile number)

**What happens if you don't respond within 4 hours:**
- Lead may be sent to another contractor (shared leads only)
- Your responsiveness score is affected (impacts future lead priority)
- Veterans may choose another contractor they've already heard from

**Best Practice:**
Set up **instant lead notifications** via:
- Email alerts
- SMS text alerts
- Mobile app push notifications
- Dedicated phone line for AdaptHome leads

---

### **5. Can I choose which leads I accept?**

**Answer:**

**Yes, you have full control over which leads you accept.**

**How it works:**
1. **Lead Preview**: You receive a notification with basic project details (no veteran contact info yet)
   - Grant type (SAH, SHA, HISA)
   - Project location (city/zip code)
   - Project scope (bathroom, kitchen, ramps, etc.)
   - Estimated project size
   - Timeline (urgent, flexible, planning phase)

2. **Accept or Decline**: You have **15 minutes** to review and decide
   - Click "Accept Lead" to pay and receive full veteran contact info
   - Click "Decline Lead" to pass (no charge)

3. **Lead Filters**: Set preferences to only see leads you want
   - Service areas (counties, cities, zip codes)
   - Project types (bathrooms, kitchens, ramps, elevators, etc.)
   - Grant types (SAH, SHA, HISA, or all)
   - Project size minimums
   - Timeline preferences

**No obligation to accept every lead.** However, declining too many leads (>70%) may affect your priority in future lead distribution.

---

### **6. What if the veteran doesn't choose me?**

**Answer:**

**You only pay for the lead, not the project outcome.**

Here's what happens if the veteran chooses another contractor:

**No Refund Policy (Standard Practice)**
- You pay for the **opportunity**, not the guarantee
- Similar to HomeAdvisor, Angi, Thumbtack, etc.
- The lead was exclusive or limited-competition (better odds than competitors)

**However, we track your success rate and offer:**

**Performance Bonus Program**
- **Close rate >50%**: 10% discount on future leads
- **Close rate >60%**: 20% discount on future leads
- **Close rate >70%**: 30% discount + priority lead access

**Why veterans might choose another contractor:**
- Price (you were too expensive or too cheap)
- Timeline (you couldn't meet their schedule)
- Communication (slow response, unprofessional)
- Specialization (other contractor had more relevant experience)
- Personality fit (they connected better with someone else)

**Maximize your close rate:**
- Respond within 1 hour
- Offer free in-home consultation
- Bring VA grant expertise (know the rules and requirements)
- Show examples of previous VA-funded projects
- Communicate clearly and frequently

**Average close rate on AdaptHome**: 45-55% (industry average for paid leads: 15-25%)

---

### **7. Do I get a refund if the project doesn't start?**

**Answer:**

**Refunds are rare, but available in specific circumstances.**

**Refund Eligible (100% refund):**
- **Invalid lead**: Veteran doesn't have an active VA grant (our verification failed)
- **Duplicate lead**: You already received this veteran through another source
- **Incorrect information**: Lead details were substantially misrepresented
- **Unreachable contact**: All provided contact info is invalid (phone, email bounce, wrong address)

**Partial Refund Eligible (50% refund):**
- **Veteran already hired contractor**: They chose someone before receiving your lead
- **Project canceled by VA**: VA rescinds grant approval (rare but happens)
- **Veteran moved out of area**: No longer in your service area

**Not Refund Eligible:**
- Veteran chose another contractor after receiving your proposal
- Veteran decided to postpone the project
- Veteran didn't respond to your initial contact (if contact info was valid)
- You couldn't meet veteran's timeline or budget
- Veteran found another funding source

**Refund Process:**
1. Submit refund request within **7 days** of receiving lead
2. Provide documentation (call logs, emails, screenshots)
3. AdaptHome investigates (2-3 business days)
4. Refund issued to your payment method (if approved)

**Our Goal**: Less than 5% refund rate (high lead quality). Current refund rate: 3.2%.

### **10. Can I serve multiple counties?**

**Answer:**

**Yes, you can serve as many counties as you want.**

**Service Area Setup:**
- **County-level**: Select entire counties (San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino)
- **City-level**: Select specific cities within counties
- **Zip code-level**: Select specific zip codes
- **Custom radius**: Set a radius from your business location (e.g., 30-mile radius)

**Cost Considerations:**
- **No additional fees** for multiple service areas
- **Lead volume increases** with larger service area
- **Competition varies** by county (less competition in Riverside/San Bernardino vs. San Diego/Orange)

**Strategic Approach:**
1. **Start with your primary county**
2. **Expand gradually** as you build capacity
3. **Monitor lead volume** and close rates by area
4. **Adjust as needed** (pause areas with low ROI)

**Example Service Area Strategy:**
- **Primary**: San Diego County (where you're based)
- **Secondary**: South Orange County (30-minute drive)
- **Tertiary**: Western Riverside County (for larger SAH projects worth the drive)

**Lead Distribution:**
- We send leads based on **proximity to the project**
- Closer contractors get priority (veterans prefer local contractors)
- You can set **maximum distance** from your location
