## **1. Welcome to AdaptHome**

### **Our Mission**

AdaptHome exists to connect disabled veterans who have VA adaptive housing grants with qualified contractors who can transform their homes into accessible, comfortable living spaces.

### **Why We're Different**

Unlike traditional lead generation platforms, AdaptHome:
- ✅ **Verifies funding BEFORE sending leads** (all veterans have approved VA grants)
- ✅ **Educates veterans** about their options (they're informed buyers, not tire-kickers)
- ✅ **Offers exclusivity options** (you're not competing with 10 other contractors)
- ✅ **Provides project details** upfront (you know exactly what you're getting)
- ✅ **No monthly fees or contracts** (pay only for leads you accept)

### **What Makes Contractors Successful on AdaptHome**

**Top-performing contractors have these traits:**
1. **Fast response times** (within 1 hour of receiving lead)
2. **VA grant expertise** (understand SAH, SHA, HISA regulations)
3. **Excellent communication** (keep veterans informed throughout process)
4. **Professional presentation** (detailed proposals, clear timelines, transparent pricing)
5. **Quality work** (positive reviews and referrals)

**Your Success is Our Success**

We only grow when you grow. That's why we're committed to providing:
- High-quality, verified leads
- Responsive support
- Training and resources
- Fair pricing
- Continuous improvement

## **4. Service Areas and Specializations**

### **Defining Your Service Areas**

**Geographic Coverage**

You can set service areas by:
1. **County** (e.g., "All of San Diego County")

**Strategic Considerations:**

**Larger Service Area = More Leads, More Drive Time**
- Pros: More lead opportunities, higher revenue potential
- Cons: Travel time reduces profitability, harder to provide fast service

**Smaller Service Area = Fewer Leads, Higher Profitability**

## **9. Communication with Veterans (Dos and Don'ts)**

### **Dos: Best Practices**

**First Contact**
- ✅ **Call within 1-4 hours** of receiving lead
- ✅ **Introduce yourself professionally**: "Hi [Veteran Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I received your information through AdaptHome regarding your VA grant project."
- ✅ **Confirm they're still looking** for a contractor
- ✅ **Express gratitude** for their service
- ✅ **Schedule in-home consultation** (free, no obligation)
- ✅ **Explain your VA grant experience**

**During Consultation**
- ✅ **Listen more than you talk** (understand their needs first)
- ✅ **Ask about their disability** (only as it relates to project scope)
- ✅ **Measure accurately** (VA requires precise specifications)
- ✅ **Explain VA grant regulations** (what's covered, what's not)
- ✅ **Discuss timeline and process**
- ✅ **Take photos** (for proposal and planning)
- ✅ **Leave professional materials** (business card, brochure, past project examples)

**Follow-Up**
- ✅ **Send proposal within 24-48 hours**
- ✅ **Include detailed scope of work**
- ✅ **Break down costs** (materials, labor, permits)
- ✅ **Provide timeline** (start date, milestones, completion)
- ✅ **Include references** (past VA grant projects if possible)
- ✅ **Offer to answer questions** (phone call, video chat)
- ✅ **Follow up in 3-5 days** if you haven't heard back

**During Project**
- ✅ **Communicate proactively** (don't wait for veteran to ask for updates)
- ✅ **Document everything** (photos, receipts, change orders)
- ✅ **Comply with VA specifications** (follow approved plans)
- ✅ **Keep job site clean** (veterans may have mobility challenges)
- ✅ **Be patient and understanding** (living through a renovation is stressful)

### **Don'ts: Avoid These Mistakes**

**First Contact**
- ❌ **Don't wait more than 24 hours** to respond
- ❌ **Don't be pushy or aggressive** (veterans can smell desperation)
- ❌ **Don't quote prices over the phone** (without seeing the project)
- ❌ **Don't bad-mouth other contractors** (unprofessional)
- ❌ **Don't make promises you can't keep** (be realistic about timelines)

**During Consultation**
- ❌ **Don't rush through the consultation** (take time to understand needs)
- ❌ **Don't talk down to the veteran** (they're informed buyers)
- ❌ **Don't ignore safety concerns** (accessibility is about safety)
- ❌ **Don't suggest cutting corners** to save money (VA has requirements)
- ❌ **Don't overpromise** (under-promise and over-deliver)

**In Proposals**
- ❌ **Don't lowball** (veterans want quality, not just cheap)
- ❌ **Don't pad the estimate** (veterans know the grant amount)
- ❌ **Don't use jargon** (write in plain English)
- ❌ **Don't leave out important details** (be thorough and transparent)

**During Project**
- ❌ **Don't go silent** (communicate regularly, even if there's no news)
- ❌ **Don't deviate from approved plans** (without VA approval)
- ❌ **Don't cut corners** (VA inspections are thorough)
- ❌ **Don't nickel-and-dime** (unexpected costs should be discussed, not surprised)

- Photos (before, during, after)

### **Payment Process**

**How Veterans Get Paid by VA:**
1. **Reimbursement Model** (most common):
   - Veteran pays contractor
   - Veteran submits receipts/invoices to VA
   - VA reimburses veteran (up to grant amount)

2. **Direct Payment Model** (less common):
   - VA pays contractor directly
   - Requires pre-approval and agreement
   - More paperwork, slower payment

**Your Payment Terms:**
- Be flexible (veterans may need to pay in phases)
- Consider progress payments tied to VA reimbursement
- Some veterans may need financing (offer options)
- Always use written contracts and receipts

## **13. Success Stories and Best Practices**

### **Case Study 1: Fast Response Wins**

**Michael Rodriguez, Accessible Home Solutions (San Diego)**

"I received a SAH lead at 2:47 PM on a Tuesday. I called the veteran at 3:15 PM—less than 30 minutes later. We scheduled a consultation for the next morning. By Friday, I had sent my proposal. The veteran told me I was the first contractor to respond and the only one who seemed genuinely interested in helping (not just making a sale). I won the project—a $94,000 complete bathroom and kitchen renovation. **Fast response time is everything.**"

**Key Takeaway:** Be the first to respond. Veterans remember who cared enough to call quickly.

### **Case Study 2: VA Grant Expertise Matters**

**Jennifer Chen, Golden State Accessibility (Orange County)**

"A veteran contacted me after receiving three other proposals. All three contractors quoted prices higher than his SHA grant amount ($20,929). I knew from experience that we could deliver a quality accessible bathroom within budget. I walked him through the VA requirements, showed him material options at different price points, and explained how we could maximize his grant. I won the project because I demonstrated expertise in VA grants—not just general contracting. **Know the VA grant rules better than anyone else.**"

**Key Takeaway:** Educate yourself on VA grant regulations. Veterans trust contractors who understand their unique funding situation.

### **Case Study 3: Under-Promise, Over-Deliver**

**David Thompson, Veterans First Remodeling (Oceanside)**

"I quoted a 6-week timeline for a HISA ramp installation, knowing I could probably finish in 4 weeks. I delivered in 4.5 weeks. The veteran was thrilled that I finished 'early' (even though it was my internal goal all along). He left a glowing review and referred two other veterans to me. Those referrals turned into $45,000 in additional revenue. **Under-promise and over-deliver on timelines.**"

**Key Takeaway:** Set realistic (or slightly conservative) expectations, then exceed them.

### **Best Practices from Top Contractors**

**1. Treat Every Lead Like Gold**
- Not every lead will convert, but treat each one like your next big project
- Even if you don't win, leave a positive impression (they may refer others)

**2. Communicate Constantly**
- Weekly updates during project (even if there's nothing new)
- Daily updates during critical phases
- Immediate updates if problems arise

**3. Document Everything**
- Take photos before, during, and after
- Keep detailed records of all communications
- Save receipts, invoices, and change orders
- Create project binders for veterans (they love this)

**4. Go Above and Beyond**
- Small touches matter (clean job site daily, protect floors, respect their home)
- Unexpected bonuses (extra grab bar, fresh paint, landscaping repair)
- Follow up after project completion (check in after 30/60/90 days)

**5. Ask for Referrals**
- Happy veterans know other veterans
- "Do you know any other veterans who could use our services?"
- Offer referral incentives (discount on future work, gift card)
