## **Message 2: Introduction to AdaptHome**
### **Send:** Day 2 (After connection is accepted)
### **Character Limit:** 1,900 characters

**Message:**

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! I wanted to reach out because AdaptHome is launching a new lead generation platform specifically for contractors working with **VA adaptive housing grants**, and I think you'd be a perfect fit.

**Here's the problem we're solving:**

Most contractors we talk to are frustrated with traditional lead platforms like HomeAdvisor:
- Leads are shared with 4-6 other contractors
- Funding isn't verified (tire-kickers common)
- Close rates are low (10-20%)
- You're competing on price, not quality

**AdaptHome is different:**

✅ **Pre-funded leads**: Every veteran has an approved VA grant ($6,976 to $104,648)
✅ **Verified funding**: We confirm grant approval before sending you the lead
✅ **Exclusive options**: Limited competition (not 6 contractors bidding)
✅ **Higher close rates**: 45-60% average
✅ **No monthly fees**: Pay only for leads you accept

**We're currently onboarding contractors in [County]** and have about 40-60 veteran leads per month in your area.

**Quick question:**

Are you currently working on VA grant projects, or is this a new area you'd be interested in exploring?

Either way, I'd love to share more about how AdaptHome works and see if it's a fit for [Company Name].

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're offering the first lead free for contractors who sign up this month. Happy to send you more details if you're interested.

## **Message 3: Value Proposition (Share Content)**
### **Send:** Day 5 (If no response to Message 2)
### **Character Limit:** 1,900 characters

**Message:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my last message about AdaptHome. I know you're probably busy, so I'll keep this brief.

**I put together a quick comparison** to show how AdaptHome stacks up against traditional lead platforms:

**HomeAdvisor/Angi:**
- Lead cost: $50-$200
- Competitors: 4-6 contractors
- Funding verified: No
- Close rate: 10-20%

**AdaptHome:**
- Lead cost: $400-$800
- Competitors: Exclusive or 1-2 max
- Funding verified: Yes (VA grant approved)
- Close rate: 45-60%

**Yes, our leads cost more upfront. But here's the ROI:**

Let's say you buy 3 SAH leads at $800 each = **$2,400**

With a 50% close rate, you close **1-2 projects**
Average SAH project value: **$95,000**

Revenue from 1-2 projects: **$95,000-$190,000**
Profit at 20% margin: **$19,000-$38,000**
**Net profit after lead costs: $16,600-$35,600**

**That's 7-15x ROI.**

Compare that to HomeAdvisor where you might spend $1,500 on 10 leads, close 1-2 small projects, and net maybe $3,500-$8,500.

**AdaptHome delivers 2-4x the ROI** because the leads are pre-qualified and funded.

---

**I've also attached a case study** from a San Diego contractor who made $89,800 in 6 months using AdaptHome (if you want to check it out).

Interested in learning more? I'm happy to hop on a quick call or just answer questions here on LinkedIn.

Best,
[Your Name]

## **Message 4: Social Proof & Testimonials**
### **Send:** Day 8 (If no response to Message 3)
### **Character Limit:** 1,900 characters

**Message:**

Hi [First Name],

I hope you don't mind me following up again. I wanted to share what some contractors in your area are saying about AdaptHome:

---

**Michael Rodriguez, Accessible Home Solutions (San Diego):**

*"I tried HomeAdvisor for 2 years and spent thousands on leads that never converted. With AdaptHome, my first lead turned into a $92,000 SAH project. The ROI is incredible. I'm now getting 2-3 leads per month and closing about 60% of them. Best decision I've made for my business."*

---

**Jennifer Chen, Golden State Accessibility (Orange County):**

*"What I love most is that I'm not competing with 5 other contractors. When I get a lead, I'm either the only one or one of two. That makes a huge difference in close rates. Plus, knowing the veteran already has VA grant approval means I'm not wasting time on tire-kickers."*

---

**David Thompson, Veterans First Remodeling (Oceanside):**

*"As a veteran-owned business, I love working with other veterans. AdaptHome makes it so easy to connect with veterans who need our services and have the funding to get it done. We've completed 5 VA projects through AdaptHome in the past 4 months. Highly recommend."*

---

**These are just a few examples.** We have 200+ contractors across Southern California who are seeing similar results.

**I'd love to add [Company Name] to our network.**

We're limiting enrollment in [County] to ensure lead quality and manageable competition. Currently, we have **5 spots remaining**.

**Would you be interested in:**
1. A quick 15-minute demo call?
2. Trying your first lead for free (no obligation)?

Let me know what works best for you.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If VA grant projects aren't a priority for you right now, no worries. But if you know any other contractors who might be interested, I'd appreciate a referral (we pay $200 for successful referrals).

## **Message 5: Final Call-to-Action**
### **Send:** Day 12 (If no response to Message 4)
### **Character Limit:** 1,900 characters

**Message:**

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about AdaptHome, and I haven't heard back yet. That's totally fine—I know you're busy running [Company Name].

**Before I close your file, I wanted to ask:**

**Is this something you're interested in, or should I stop reaching out?**

I don't want to be a pest, so I'll respect whatever you decide:

1. **Not interested** → Reply with "Not for me" and I'll leave you alone. No hard feelings.

2. **Interested, but bad timing** → Reply with "Follow up in [X months]" and I'll check back with you then.

3. **Interested, have questions** → Let's schedule a quick call: [CALENDAR LINK]

4. **Ready to sign up** → Register here: www.adapthome.com/contractor-signup

---

**If I don't hear from you, I'll assume you're not interested** and won't message you again about AdaptHome.

But before I go, I wanted to leave you with this:

**What makes AdaptHome different from every other lead platform:**

- We're **veteran-focused** (not just accessibility, but specifically VA grants)
- We **verify funding before sending leads** (no tire-kickers)
- We **limit competition** (exclusive or limited exclusivity options)
- We have **no contracts or monthly fees** (pay only for leads you accept)
- We offer **higher close rates** (45-60% vs. 10-20% industry average)

**And we're offering your first lead free** (this month only).

---

**Last chance to join before we cap enrollment in [County].**

If you're even remotely curious, I'd encourage you to take advantage of the **free first lead**. Worst case, it doesn't convert and you've lost nothing. Best case, it turns into a $20,000-$100,000 project.

**Sign up here:** www.adapthome.com/contractor-signup

Thanks for your time, [First Name]. I hope to see you on the platform.

Best,
[Your Name]

## **LinkedIn Outreach Best Practices**

### **Profile Optimization (Before You Start Outreach)**

**Your LinkedIn Profile Should Include:**
- Professional headshot
- Compelling headline: "Helping Contractors Connect with Pre-Funded VA Grant Projects | AdaptHome"
- Detailed "About" section explaining AdaptHome
- Company page for AdaptHome
- Content posts about VA grants, accessibility, veterans

### **Research Before Connecting**

**Look for these signals that a contractor is a good fit:**
- ✅ Located in Southern California (San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino)
- ✅ Specializes in accessibility, remodeling, or aging-in-place
- ✅ CAPS certified (Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist)
- ✅ Veteran-owned business (bonus)
- ✅ Active on LinkedIn (posts regularly)
- ✅ Has positive reviews/testimonials on their profile

**Red flags to avoid:**
- ❌ New construction only (not remodeling)
- ❌ Commercial-only contractors
- ❌ Out of state
- ❌ No clear specialization
- ❌ Inactive LinkedIn profile

### **Message Timing**

**Best times to send LinkedIn messages:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM PST** (best response rates)
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 5-7 PM PST** (after work hours)
- Avoid weekends (low activity)
- Avoid Monday mornings (inbox overload)

### **Message Length**

**Connection Request (Message 1):**
- Keep it under 300 characters
- Personalize with specific detail about their profile
- Mention mutual connection if possible

**Follow-Up Messages (Messages 2-5):**
- Aim for 300-600 characters (short and scannable)
- Use bullet points for easy reading
- Include ONE clear call-to-action
- LinkedIn allows up to 1,900 characters, but shorter is better

### **Personalization Tokens**

**Use these variables for scale:**
- `[First Name]` - Contractor's first name
- `[Company Name]` - Contractor's company
- `[County]` - Their primary service area
- `[Specialization]` - Bathroom, kitchen, ramps, etc.
- `[Mutual Connection]` - If you have one
- `[Veteran Status]` - If they're a veteran

### **Response Handling**

**If they reply with interest:**
- Respond within 1 hour
- Offer to schedule a call immediately
- Send calendar link for easy booking
- Provide one-pager or resources

**If they reply with questions:**
- Answer thoroughly but concisely
- Offer to discuss on a call if complex
- Share relevant case studies or testimonials
- Address objections directly

**If they reply "not interested":**
- Thank them for their time
- Ask if you can follow up in 6 months
- Offer to connect them with resources anyway
- Ask if they know anyone who might be interested (referrals)

### **Tracking & Metrics**

**Monitor these KPIs:**
- **Connection acceptance rate** (aim for 40%+)
- **Reply rate** (aim for 15-25%)
- **Meeting booking rate** (aim for 5-10%)
- **Sign-up conversion rate** (aim for 2-5%)

**If rates are low:**
- Test different message templates
- Improve personalization
- Adjust targeting (better prospect selection)
- Optimize profile (add social proof, testimonials)

### **Automation Tools (Use Wisely)**

**Recommended tools for scaling LinkedIn outreach:**
- **Dux-Soup** - Auto-visit profiles, send connection requests
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** - Advanced search and lead lists
- **Expandi** - Automated messaging campaigns
- **Phantombuster** - Extract emails and data

**Important:**
- Use automation carefully (LinkedIn limits daily actions)
- Always personalize messages (avoid generic templates)
- Monitor account health (avoid being flagged as spam)
- Keep daily limits conservative (20-30 connections/day max)
