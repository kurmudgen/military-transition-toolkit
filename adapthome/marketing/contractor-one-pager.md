# AdaptHome: Pre-Funded VA Adaptive Housing Leads

## Stop Competing for Shared Leads. Start Winning Pre-Funded VA Projects.

---

### **The Problem You're Facing**

As a contractor, you know the frustration of paying for leads that go nowhere:

- **HomeAdvisor/Angi**: Pay $50-$200 per lead, compete with 4-6 other contractors
- **Shared leads**: Veterans shop around, most leads never convert
- **Price shoppers**: Clients focused on cheapest bid, not quality work
- **Uncertain funding**: "I'm just getting estimates" turns into wasted time
- **Low close rates**: 10-20% conversion even after paying for the lead

**You deserve better.**
