## What You Can Do

**Immediately:**
1. Start contractor outreach (150+ qualified leads)

**Solution:** AdaptHome matches them with verified, experienced contractors
**Business Model:** Contractors pay for high-quality, pre-funded leads

**Competition:** Limited (no direct competitor in this niche)
**Timing:** VA grant amounts increasing, demand growing

## Final Recommendation

**LAUNCH NOW**
