## Bottom Line Up Front

25B Information Technology Specialist is one of the smoothest military-to-civilian transitions out there. Your experience with Army networks, security protocols, and IT infrastructure translates **directly** to civilian IT roles paying **$60,000-$75,000 entry-level** and **$90,000-$130,000+ with 3-5 years and the right certs**. High demand, clear certification path (Security+, Network+, CISSP), and if you've got an active clearance, you're basically printing money. Remote work is common. This is a good position to be in.

## Why 25B has the advantage

Let's start with the reality: you picked the right MOS for civilian transition.

Unlike 11B or 19D, your job exists almost identically in the civilian world. Networking, system administration, cybersecurity, helpdesk support—these are **multi-billion dollar industries** desperate for qualified people.

The unemployment rate for cybersecurity professionals is basically zero. There are over **700,000 unfilled cybersecurity jobs** in the U.S. right now. Companies are hiring people with Security+ and 2 years of experience into $75K roles.

If you've got:
- Active **Secret or Top Secret clearance**
- **Security+ certification** (or higher)
- **3+ years of Army IT experience**

You can land a $80K-$100K job within 30 days of getting out. Not exaggerating.

## Best civilian career paths for 25B

Your military IT experience opens multiple doors. Here's where 25Bs actually land.

### Cybersecurity specialist (highest demand)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst
- Cybersecurity analyst
- Information security specialist
- Penetration tester / ethical hacker
- Security engineer

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level SOC analyst:** $60,000-$75,000
- **Cybersecurity analyst (2-4 years):** $80,000-$100,000
- **Senior security engineer:** $110,000-$140,000
- **Penetration tester / red team:** $95,000-$130,000
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):** $150,000-$250,000+ (10+ years experience)

**What translates directly:**
- Network security monitoring
- Vulnerability scanning and remediation
- Incident response procedures
- Security policies and compliance (you've worked with Army regs)
- Access control and authentication
- Security tool operation (SIEM, IDS/IPS)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Security+ (CompTIA)** - Entry-level requirement. Many 25Bs already have this. If not, get it immediately. Cost: $400 exam. Study time: 2-4 weeks if you know the material.
- **CySA+ (CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst)** - Analyst-level cert. Cost: $400. Value: Mid-level positions.
- **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)** - Gold standard. Requires 5 years experience. Cost: $750. Salary bump: $10K-20K.
- **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** - If you're going offensive security route. Cost: $1,200+.

**Reality check:**
SOC analyst roles are 24/7 operations, which means shift work. Nights, weekends, holidays. Sound familiar? You're already used to it, so you've got an advantage over civilian candidates who want 9-5.

After 2-3 years as an analyst, you can move to security engineering or architecture roles with better hours and significantly higher pay.

Remote work is increasingly common post-COVID. Many SOC positions are hybrid or fully remote.

**Best for:** 25Bs who like the technical challenge, want high earning potential, and don't mind shift work initially.

### Network administrator / engineer

**Civilian job titles:**
- Network administrator
- Network engineer
- Systems administrator
- Infrastructure engineer
- Cloud network engineer

**Salary ranges:**
- **Junior network admin:** $55,000-$70,000
- **Network engineer:** $75,000-$95,000
- **Senior network engineer:** $95,000-$120,000
- **Network architect:** $120,000-$150,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Configuring routers, switches, firewalls (Cisco, Juniper)
- Troubleshooting network connectivity
- Managing IP schemes and VLANs
- Monitoring network performance
- Implementing network security policies

**Certifications needed:**
- **Network+ (CompTIA)** - Entry-level. Cost: $350.
- **CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** - Industry standard for networking. Cost: $300 exam. Study time: 2-3 months. Salary impact: $10K-15K bump.
- **CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional)** - Advanced. Cost: $400 per exam (multiple exams). Senior-level positions.

**Reality check:**
Networking is more stable and predictable than security. You're maintaining infrastructure, not fighting fires. On-call rotations are common, but day-to-day is less chaotic than SOC work.

Cloud networking (AWS, Azure) is the future. Traditional on-premises network jobs are slowly declining. If you're going this route, get cloud certifications too (AWS Solutions Architect, Azure Administrator).

**Best for:** 25Bs who like stable, predictable work and enjoy troubleshooting network issues.

### Systems administrator / engineer

**Civilian job titles:**
- Systems administrator (Windows/Linux)
- DevOps engineer
- Cloud engineer (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Site reliability engineer (SRE)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Junior systems admin:** $55,000-$68,000
- **Systems administrator:** $70,000-$90,000
- **DevOps engineer:** $95,000-$125,000
- **Senior cloud engineer:** $115,000-$145,000

**What translates directly:**
- Managing Windows Server and Active Directory
- Linux system administration
- User account management and permissions
- Patch management and updates
- Scripting and automation (PowerShell, Bash)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Linux+ or RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator)** - If you're going Linux route. Cost: $400-500.
- **MCSA (Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate)** - Windows server admin. (Note: Microsoft retired MCSA, replaced with role-based certs like Azure Administrator).
- **AWS Certified Solutions Architect** or **Azure Administrator** - Cloud is where the money is. Cost: $150-300 per exam.

**Reality check:**
Traditional sysadmin roles are being replaced by cloud and DevOps positions. The job title "systems administrator" is becoming less common. Instead, companies want "cloud engineers" or "DevOps engineers" who know automation, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), and CI/CD pipelines.

This is a growth path: sysadmin → senior sysadmin → DevOps engineer or cloud architect. Plan for it.

**Best for:** 25Bs who like automation, scripting, and are comfortable learning cloud platforms.

### IT helpdesk / desktop support (entry point)

**Civilian job titles:**
- IT helpdesk technician
- Desktop support specialist
- IT support analyst
- Service desk analyst

**Salary ranges:**
- **Tier 1 helpdesk:** $40,000-$50,000
- **Tier 2 helpdesk:** $50,000-$62,000
- **Desktop support specialist:** $48,000-$60,000

**What translates directly:**
- Troubleshooting user issues
- Password resets and account management
- Imaging and deploying workstations
- Basic network troubleshooting
- Ticketing systems and documentation

**Certifications needed:**
- **A+ (CompTIA)** - Basic IT cert. Cost: $250 per exam (2 exams). Many 25Bs can skip this if they have Security+ already.
- **ITIL Foundation** - IT service management framework. Cost: $300. Valued by large enterprises.

**Reality check:**
Helpdesk is entry-level. If you're an E-5+ with 4-6 years as a 25B, you're overqualified for tier 1 helpdesk. But if you're getting out as an E-4 with 3 years, it's a solid starting point while you build certs.

Don't stay in helpdesk long-term. It's a 1-2 year stepping stone to admin or engineering roles.

**Best for:** Junior 25Bs who need immediate employment and will use helpdesk as a launch pad.

### Government contractor / defense IT (clearance jobs)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Information systems security officer (ISSO)
- Systems administrator (DoD)
- Network engineer (defense contractor)
- Cybersecurity analyst (cleared)

**Salary ranges:**
- **ISSO (Secret clearance):** $75,000-$95,000
- **ISSO (Top Secret/SCI):** $90,000-$115,000
- **Senior network engineer (TS/SCI):** $110,000-$140,000
- **Cleared penetration tester:** $120,000-$150,000+

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're working on DoD networks doing the same stuff you did in the Army.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Security+ (DoD 8570 baseline requirement)** - Non-negotiable.
- **CISSP** or **CASP+** - For higher-level ISSO roles.
- **Active clearance** - Secret minimum, TS/SCI is golden.

**Reality check:**
If you've got an active **Top Secret/SCI clearance**, you are in insane demand. Companies will fight over you.

The clearance itself is worth $10K-20K in salary. Getting a civilian cleared costs companies $50K-100K+ and takes 12-18 months. If you already have it, you're saving them that cost and time.

Defense contractor jobs are stable, well-paid, and often in Northern Virginia (D.C. area), San Antonio, Colorado Springs, or other military-heavy regions. Cost of living in NoVA is high, but salaries compensate.

Many positions are on-site at military bases or secure facilities. Remote work is less common in cleared roles.

**Best for:** 25Bs with active clearances who want high pay and stability working in defense IT.

### Remote IT / cyber jobs

One of the biggest advantages of IT: **remote work is normal**.

Post-COVID, many IT roles went fully remote or hybrid. This is huge for work-life balance and location flexibility.

**Remote-friendly roles:**
- SOC analyst (many SOCs now operate 24/7 with distributed teams)
- Cloud engineer (working in AWS/Azure is inherently remote-capable)
- Security analyst
- DevOps engineer
- IT project manager

**Less remote-friendly:**
- Desktop support (you're touching physical hardware)
- On-site network engineer (managing data center equipment)
- Cleared government contractor roles (often require on-site presence)

If remote work is a priority, target cloud and cybersecurity roles at tech companies or startups, not defense contractors or enterprises with on-prem infrastructure.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop putting military jargon on your resume. Here's the translation:

| Military Experience | Civilian Translation |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Managed battalion network operations | Administered enterprise network infrastructure supporting 500+ users |
| Implemented STIGs and security compliance | Ensured compliance with security policies and industry standards (NIST, ISO 27001) |
| Configured NIPR/SIPR networks | Designed and managed segmented networks with strict access controls |
| Helpdesk support for classified systems | Provided IT support in secure, high-availability environments |
| Active Directory user management | Managed user accounts, permissions, and group policies in Active Directory |
| Performed system patching and updates | Maintained system security through regular patch management and vulnerability remediation |
| Operated SIEM tools for threat detection | Monitored security events using SIEM platforms; responded to incidents |
| Led team of 3-5 junior IT specialists | Supervised IT team; mentored junior technicians |

Use **active verbs**: Managed, Administered, Configured, Implemented, Monitored, Secured.

Use **numbers**: "Supported 500+ users," "Managed $1.2M in IT assets," "Reduced incidents by 30%."

Use **civilian frameworks**: NIST, ISO 27001, ITIL, COBIT (instead of Army regs and STIGs).

## Certifications priority list

You're going to hear about a million certs. Here's what actually matters, in order.

### Tier 1: Get these immediately (required for most jobs)

**Security+ (CompTIA)**
- **Cost:** $400 exam
- **Study time:** 2-4 weeks (if you know the material)
- **Value:** DoD 8570 baseline. Required for almost all government IT jobs. Expected by many private sector employers.
- **Priority:** If you don't have this, get it before you ETS.

**Network+ (CompTIA)** *(if you're going networking route)*
- **Cost:** $350
- **Study time:** 4-6 weeks
- **Value:** Baseline networking knowledge. Good foundation before CCNA.

**CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** *(if you're going networking route)*
- **Cost:** $300 exam
- **Study time:** 2-3 months
- **Value:** Industry standard for network engineers. $10K-15K salary bump.

### Tier 2: Get these within first 2 years (mid-career advancement)

**CySA+ (CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst)**
- **Cost:** $400
- **Study time:** 6-8 weeks
- **Value:** Mid-level security analyst cert. Good stepping stone to CISSP.

**AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** or **Azure Administrator**
- **Cost:** $150-300
- **Study time:** 2-3 months
- **Value:** Cloud is the future. This cert opens DevOps and cloud engineering roles.

**CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)**
- **Cost:** $750 exam
- **Requirements:** 5 years of experience in 2+ CISSP domains (can substitute 1 year with degree)
- **Study time:** 3-6 months
- **Value:** Gold standard in cybersecurity. Senior-level positions. $10K-20K salary bump.

### Tier 3: Specialized (get these if going specific direction)

**CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** - Offensive security, penetration testing
**OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)** - Hardcore pentest cert, very respected
**RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator)** - Linux admin roles
**CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional)** - Advanced networking

Don't cert-chase. Get the certs relevant to the job you're targeting.

## The clearance factor (this is huge)

If you've got an active **Secret** or **Top Secret clearance**, you need to understand how valuable that is.

**Clearance value in salary:**
- Active Secret: +$10,000-$15,000
- Active Top Secret: +$15,000-$25,000
- Top Secret/SCI: +$20,000-$30,000

Getting a clearance as a civilian costs employers $50K-$100K+ and takes 12-18 months (or longer). If you already have one, you're saving them that time and cost, which translates to higher salary offers.

**How to keep your clearance active:**
You need to be in a job that requires your clearance to keep it active. If you leave the military and take a non-cleared job, your clearance goes inactive after 2 years.

**Strategy:** If you have TS/SCI, prioritize cleared jobs for your first civilian role to keep it active. Even if the job pays slightly less, the long-term value of an active clearance is worth it.

**Where to find cleared jobs:**
- **ClearanceJobs.com** - The main site for cleared positions
- **Indeed, LinkedIn** (filter by "security clearance required")
- Defense contractors: Booz Allen, Leidos, CACI, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics

## Common 25B mistakes in transition

Let's talk about what not to do.

**Mistake #1: Taking the first job offer without negotiating**

You've got in-demand skills. Don't accept the first offer. Negotiate. Ask for $5K-10K more. Worst they say is no.

If you've got Security+ and an active clearance, you should be starting at **minimum $65K-70K**, even entry-level. If they're offering you $50K, they're lowballing you.

**Mistake #2: Staying in helpdesk too long**

Helpdesk is a stepping stone, not a career. If you're still in tier 1 helpdesk after 18 months, you're stuck. Get your certs, apply for admin/analyst roles, move up.

**Mistake #3: Not learning cloud**

On-premises IT jobs are declining. Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) is the future. If you're not learning cloud platforms, you're limiting your career growth.

Get your AWS Solutions Architect or Azure Administrator cert within your first 2 years. It'll future-proof your career.

**Mistake #4: Ignoring soft skills**

Technical skills get you the interview. Soft skills get you the job.

Learn to communicate with non-technical people. Practice explaining technical concepts in simple terms. Work on your resume and LinkedIn profile. Network.

Military folks often underestimate how important communication and networking are in the civilian world.

**Mistake #5: Not using your GI Bill**

Your GI Bill can cover certifications, associate's or bachelor's degrees in IT/cybersecurity, and even some boot camps.

An associate's in cybersecurity from a community college costs you $0 with GI Bill and gives you credentials + baseline knowledge. A bachelor's in IT or computer science opens management and senior technical roles.

Don't leave that benefit on the table.

## Real 25B success stories

**Sarah, 25, former 25B (4 years, E-4) → SOC Analyst in Austin, TX**

Sarah got out with Security+ and an active Secret clearance. She applied to 15 cybersecurity jobs, got 4 interviews, landed a SOC analyst role at $68,000. After 18 months, she got her CySA+ and moved to a senior analyst role at $85,000. Now she's studying for CISSP.

**Kevin, 28, former 25B (6 years, E-5) → Network Engineer in Northern Virginia**

Kevin had CCNA and Top Secret clearance. He landed a defense contractor gig as a network engineer supporting DoD networks at $95,000. After 3 years and getting his CCNP, he's now at $118,000 as a senior network engineer. Fully remote.

**Jordan, 30, former 25B (8 years, E-6) → Cloud Engineer in Seattle**

Jordan transitioned into helpdesk at $52K while getting AWS certifications. Within 2 years, he moved to a cloud engineer role at a tech company making $105K. Now he's a senior cloud architect at $140K. Learned DevOps, Terraform, and Kubernetes on the job.

## Your 90-day action plan

Here's what to do in your first 90 days after ETS:

### Month 1: Credentials and applications
- **Get Security+ if you don't have it** (study 2-4 weeks, take exam)
- **Update your resume** using civilian language (use our [resume builder](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com))
- **Set up LinkedIn** - add certifications, skills, professional photo
- **Register on job sites** - Indeed, ClearanceJobs, Dice, LinkedIn Jobs
- **Apply to 15-20 jobs per week** (quality + quantity)

### Month 2: Networking and skill-building
- **Attend veteran job fairs** (bring resumes, talk to recruiters)
- **Join IT veteran groups** on LinkedIn and Facebook
- **Build a home lab** (practice networking, security tools, cloud platforms)
- **Start studying for next cert** (CCNA, CySA+, or AWS depending on your path)
- **Keep applying** (15-20 jobs per week)

### Month 3: Interview and negotiate
- **Practice interview answers** - prepare for technical and behavioral questions
- **Research companies** before interviews
- **Negotiate salary** - don't accept first offer
- **Consider contract roles** - contract-to-hire can be a good entry point
- **Evaluate offers carefully** - consider salary, benefits, remote work, growth potential

## Bottom line for 25Bs

You're in one of the best military jobs for civilian transition. The skills translate, the demand is high, and the pay is good.

Entry-level: **$60K-75K**. With certs and experience: **$90K-130K+**. With clearance: add **$10K-30K**.

Get Security+ if you don't have it. Get CCNA or AWS cert within 2 years. Keep your clearance active if you have one. Don't settle for helpdesk long-term.

The cybersecurity field is desperate for people. You've got the experience. Get the certs, translate your resume, and apply.

You're not starting from scratch. You're starting ahead.
