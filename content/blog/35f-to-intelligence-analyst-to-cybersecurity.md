Major defense contractors, tech companies, and government agencies actively recruit 35F veterans for cybersecurity roles.

## Why 35F Intelligence Analysts Excel in Cybersecurity

Every intelligence analyst researching civilian careers hears: "Cyber requires programming skills." "You need a computer science degree." "Intelligence work doesn't translate to IT."

Here's the truth that hiring managers understand: **Cybersecurity is 70% intelligence work and 30% technical skills.**

You didn't just "make PowerPoint slides." You:
- Analyzed complex data from multiple intelligence sources
- Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies in large datasets
- Assessed threats and predicted adversary behavior
- Produced intelligence products under tight deadlines
- Synthesized information from HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, GEOINT
- Briefed senior leaders on threat assessments
- Maintained strict operational security and classifications
- Worked with sensitive intelligence systems and databases
- Collaborated across organizations and agencies
- Adapted analysis methods to changing threat environments

That's not "military paperwork" - that's advanced analytical methodology directly applicable to cyber threat intelligence. The adversaries changed from nation-states and terrorist groups to cyber threat actors, but the analysis process is identical.

## Cybersecurity Career Paths for 35F Veterans

Let's get specific with real 2025 salary data and actual career progression.

### Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst (most direct transition)

- **CRISC (Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control)** - Risk management - Cost: $575
- **PMP (Project Management Professional)** - Program management - Cost: $555

**Reality check:**
This path leverages your intelligence program management experience more than technical cybersecurity skills. If you were a 35F E-6+ managing intelligence operations, briefing commanders, and coordinating across organizations, you're ready for cybersecurity program management.

These roles require understanding cybersecurity concepts and frameworks (NIST, RMF, FISMA), but focus on management, compliance, risk, and governance rather than hands-on technical work.

Common in cleared contractor positions supporting government agencies. Your military leadership experience and clearance are more valuable than deep technical expertise.

**Best for:** Senior 35F NCOs (E-6+) who want leadership roles managing cybersecurity programs rather than hands-on technical work.

## The Value of Your Security Clearance

If you have an active security clearance, understand its market value:

**Secret Clearance:** +$15,000-$25,000 annual salary premium
**Top Secret:** +$25,000-$40,000 annual salary premium
**TS/SCI:** +$35,000-$50,000 annual salary premium
**TS/SCI with polygraph:** +$45,000-$60,000 annual salary premium

**How to maintain clearance during transition:**
- Accept cleared position within 24 months of separation (clearance remains active)
- Some employers will sponsor clearance reinvestigation if lapsed less than 2 years
- Document your clearance type and date on resume
- Register with ClearanceJobs.com immediately after separation

**Critical timing:** Active clearances are transferable. Let a clearance lapse, and the next employer faces 12-18 months and $100K+ costs to reinstate. This makes you significantly less attractive.

Accept a cleared contractor position even if pay is moderate initially. Maintain clearance while gaining certifications, then move to higher-paying cleared positions once certified.

## The Skills Gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest about technical gaps between intelligence and cybersecurity:

**Networking fundamentals:** You need to understand how networks operate, TCP/IP, routing, protocols. Not deep expertise, but working knowledge for context.

**Operating systems:** Windows and Linux basics - file systems, processes, services, logs. Important for understanding what analysts are looking at.

**Security tools and technologies:** SIEM platforms, IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint protection. Tool-specific training usually provided by employer, but understanding categories helps.

**Cyber threat landscape:** Different adversary profiles (nation-state APTs, ransomware groups, hacktivists), attack vectors, common techniques. Significant overlap with intelligence tradecraft but cyber-specific.

**Technical indicators:** IP addresses, domains, file hashes, YARA rules. Technical indicators vs. behavioral intelligence you're used to.

**Programming/scripting basics:** Not required for all roles, but Python and PowerShell knowledge increasingly valuable. Ability to automate analysis tasks, parse data.

**Good news:** Most of these are learned on the job or through short training. Your analytical methodology is harder to teach and more valuable than technical knowledge.
