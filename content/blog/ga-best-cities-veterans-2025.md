## Climate and Weather Considerations

### Overall Georgia Climate

- **Summers**: Hot and humid (88-95°F, high humidity statewide)
- **Rainfall**: 45-50 inches annually
- **Growing season**: Long (220+ days in south Georgia)

### By Region

**North Georgia** (Gainesville, Athens):
- Occasional snow (1-3 inches per year)
- Four distinct seasons
- Cooler summers than south Georgia (88-90°F vs. 92-95°F)
- Mountain access for cooler summer escapes

**Central Georgia** (Atlanta, Macon, Warner Robins, Augusta):
- Rare snow
- Hot, humid summers (90-92°F)
- Tornado risk (spring)
- Mild winters (45-50°F)

**South Georgia** (Columbus, Albany, Valdosta):
- Almost never snows
- Very hot, humid summers (92-95°F)
- Subtropical feel

### Veteran Health Considerations

**Mild winters**: Excellent for veterans with cold-weather injuries or arthritis aggravated by cold.
