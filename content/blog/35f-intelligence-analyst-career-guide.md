# 35F Intelligence Analyst: Your Clearance Is Worth $80K-$150K+ (Here's How)

Let's start with what you already know: your TS/SCI clearance is worth a fortune.

Getting a clearance from scratch costs employers $3,000-$15,000 and takes 6-18 months. You already have one. That makes you instantly valuable to hundreds of employers who need cleared analysts yesterday.

But here's what you might not know: where you work, who you work for, and which certifications you get will determine whether you're making $65K or $150K in the same job market.

The intelligence field has three distinct paths—government, contractor, and private sector—and each has completely different salary ranges, job security, and lifestyle trade-offs. Let's break down exactly how to maximize your 35F experience and clearance.

## The Three Paths: Quick Overview

| Path | Starting Salary | Mid-Career Salary | Job Security | Clearance Required | Best For |
|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Defense Contractor** | $75K-$95K | $110K-$150K+ | Medium | Yes (TS/SCI) | Highest pay, best benefits, tied to contracts |
| **Federal Government** | $60K-$80K | $95K-$130K | Very High | Yes (TS/SCI) | Pension, stability, slower pay growth |
| **Private Sector (Tech/Finance)** | $80K-$100K | $120K-$180K+ | Medium-High | Sometimes | Highest ceiling, less military culture |

Your TS/SCI clearance is most valuable in defense contracting and federal government. Private sector cyber and threat intelligence roles pay the most but often don't require (or use) your clearance after initial hire.

## Why Your Clearance Is a Golden Ticket

Here are the numbers that matter:

**Cost to obtain TS/SCI from scratch:**
- Initial investigation: $5,000-$15,000
- Processing time: 6-18 months
- Reinvestigation (every 5 years): $5,000+

**Your clearance has already been paid for and adjudicated.** To employers, that means:
- You can start working immediately on classified contracts
- They don't have to wait 12+ months for your investigation
- They don't have to risk a denial after investing in hiring and training you

**Cleared professionals earn 15-30% more** than their non-cleared counterparts in the same roles. A $75K intelligence analyst job becomes a $95K job when a clearance is required.

**But here's the catch:** your clearance is only valuable if you keep it active. Let it lapse, and you're back to square one—employers won't wait 18 months for a reinvestigation.

## Maintaining Your Clearance After Separation

Your TS/SCI clearance doesn't expire the day you ETS, but it goes inactive if you're not in a cleared position.

**Key timeline:**
- **0-24 months after last cleared position:** Your clearance is in "current" status and can be quickly reactivated by a sponsoring employer
- **24+ months:** Your clearance is considered "expired" and requires a full reinvestigation

**What this means:** You have a 2-year window to land a cleared job after separation. After that, your clearance value drops significantly.

**Action step:** If you're within 90 days of separation, start applying for cleared positions NOW. Don't wait until you're out—your clearance is most valuable while it's still active.

## Path 1: Defense Contractor — The Highest Pay

Defense contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, CACI, General Dynamics, and hundreds of smaller firms employ tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to support DoD, NSA, CIA, DIA, and other agencies.

**This is where most 35Fs go**, and for good reason: the money is excellent, the work is familiar, and your military experience is highly valued.

### Salary Ranges by Experience Level

**Entry-level (0-2 years out):** $70,000-$90,000
- Junior intelligence analyst
- All-source analyst
- SIGINT/GEOINT/HUMINT analyst (depending on your specialty)

**Mid-level (3-5 years):** $90,000-$120,000
- Senior intelligence analyst
- Targeting analyst
- Collection management officer
- GEOINT analyst with advanced skills

**Senior-level (6-10 years):** $120,000-$150,000
- Lead analyst
- Intelligence team lead
- Threat intelligence manager
- Specialized technical analyst (SIGINT, cyber)

**Expert-level (10+ years):** $150,000-$200,000+
- Program manager
- Intelligence operations manager
- Subject matter expert (SME)
- Fusion center director

**Add 10-20% for high-demand locations** like DC metro area, Tampa (SOCOM), San Antonio (NSA/Cyber), and Charlottesville (NCTC).

### Top Defense Contractors for 35Fs

**Big players (1,000+ intelligence analysts):**
- Booz Allen Hamilton
- Leidos
- CACI International
- General Dynamics IT
- Northrop Grumman
- BAE Systems
- ManTech (now part of CACI)
- SAIC

**Mid-size firms (strong reputations):**
- Peraton
- Parsons
- Amentum
- Guidehouse
- Perspecta (now part of Peraton)

**Small firms (niche specializations):**
- Analytic Services Inc. (ANSER)
- The Soufan Group

### What Contractor Life Looks Like

**Pros:**
- **Highest salaries** in the intelligence field
- Excellent benefits (health, 401k matching, bonuses)
- Work on cutting-edge intelligence problems
- Familiar military culture (many colleagues are veterans)
- Faster promotions than government
- More flexibility to change contracts/companies

**Cons:**
- Job security tied to contract wins/losses (contracts are typically 3-5 years)
- Can be "recompeted" off a contract even if you're doing great work
- Less job stability than federal government
- Some positions require 50+ hour weeks (especially targeting analysts)
- Frequent clearance reinvestigations and polygraphs

**Reality check:** Contractors get laid off when contracts end or are lost to competitors. It's not uncommon to have 3-5 different employers in a 10-year career, even if you're doing the same work at the same location. But the pay premium makes up for it.

### Where Contractors Work

- Tax advantages (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion)

### How to Land a Contractor Job

**1. Start applying 90-120 days before separation**

Contractors know you need transition time. Apply while you're still in uniform—your active clearance makes you more attractive.

**Where to look:**
- **ClearanceJobs.com** (the #1 site for cleared positions)
- LinkedIn (use keywords like "TS/SCI" and "35F" in your profile)
- Company career pages (Booz Allen, Leidos, CACI, etc.)
- Recruiter outreach (they'll find you if your LinkedIn is updated)

**2. Tailor your resume for contractors**

Contractors want to see:
- Your clearance level in bold at the top: **"Active TS/SCI (current)"**
- Specific intelligence disciplines (SIGINT, GEOINT, HUMINT, all-source)
- Tools and databases (Palantir, M3, DCGS-A, CIDNE, Google Earth, ArcGIS)
- Joint and coalition operations experience
- Deployments and operational experience

**3. Get certifications (more on this below)**

Contractors love certifications because many contracts require them. Even if the job posting doesn't mention certs, having them makes you more competitive.

**4. Network with contractors before you separate**

Go to military job fairs, connect with contractors on LinkedIn, reach out to veterans working at target companies. Referrals carry huge weight in contractor hiring.

## Path 2: Federal Government (GS Scale) — The Most Stable

Federal government intelligence analyst jobs offer the best job security and a pension, but lower starting salaries and slower career progression.

### GS Pay Scale for Intelligence Analysts

Most 35Fs enter federal service as **GS-9, GS-11, or GS-12** depending on education and experience.

**2025 Pay Scale (Washington DC locality):**

| Grade | Step 1 | Step 5 | Step 10 |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| GS-7 | $54,505 | $63,144 | $70,965 |
| GS-9 | $60,137 | $69,658 | $78,334 |
| GS-11 | $72,750 | $84,203 | $94,637 |
| GS-12 | $87,198 | $100,925 | $113,628 |
| GS-13 | $103,690 | $120,014 | $135,209 |
| GS-14 | $122,530 | $141,773 | $159,806 |
| GS-15 | $144,128 | $166,814 | $187,500 |

**Note:** Pay varies by locality. DC area pays highest. Rural areas pay 14-16% less.

**Promotion timeline:**
- Start: GS-9 or GS-11
- 1-2 years: GS-11 or GS-12
- 3-5 years: GS-12 or GS-13
- 6-10 years: GS-13 or GS-14
- 10+ years: GS-14 or GS-15

**Realistic career earning potential:** $60K (entry) → $130K-$160K (senior)

### Federal Agencies Hiring 35Fs

**Top employers:**
- **DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency):** All-source, targeting, GEOINT
- **NSA (National Security Agency):** SIGINT, cybersecurity, cryptanalysis
- **CIA:** All-source, HUMINT, operations support
- **NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency):** GEOINT, imagery analysis
- **FBI:** Counterterrorism, counterintelligence, intelligence analysis
- **State Department (INR):** Political-military analysis, open-source
- **DHS:** Homeland security intelligence, threat analysis
- **Various DoD agencies:** Each military branch has civilian intelligence analysts

### Pros and Cons of Federal Employment

**Pros:**
- **Best job security** (nearly impossible to get fired once you're past probation)
- **Pension** (FERS retirement after 20-30 years)
- **Stable income and benefits** (health, TSP with 5% match)
- **Career progression** is structured and predictable
- **Work-life balance** (generally 40-hour weeks, less than contractors)

**Cons:**
- **Lower starting salary** than contractors ($10K-$20K less)
- **Slower promotions** (grade increases take time)
- **More bureaucracy** and red tape
- **Less flexibility** to move between agencies (compared to contractors switching contracts)

**Best for:** 35Fs who want long-term stability, a pension, and work-life balance over maximum salary.

### How to Land a Federal Job

**1. Use USAJOBS.gov**

All federal jobs are posted on USAJOBS. Search for:
- Intelligence Analyst (0132 series)
- All-Source Analyst
- GEOINT Analyst
- SIGINT Analyst

**2. Understand veteran preference**

As a veteran with an honorable discharge, you get **5-point veteran preference** (or 10 points if you have a service-connected disability).

This means your score is boosted above non-veteran applicants. It's a HUGE advantage. Use it.

**3. Master the federal resume format**

Federal resumes are LONG (3-5 pages) and detailed. You need to:
- List every duty in detail (not bullet points)
- Use keywords from the job announcement
- Include months/years for every position
- Describe your work in exhaustive detail

(We'll cover federal resume writing in depth in our [complete USAJOBS guide](/blog/federal-resume-veterans-guide).)

**4. Apply to multiple agencies**

Federal hiring is slow (3-6 months) and competitive. Apply to 10-20 positions and be patient.

**5. Consider Pathways Programs**

Some agencies offer **veterans hiring authorities** like VRA (Veterans Recruitment Appointment) or 30% Disabled Veteran Authority. These bypass competitive hiring and fast-track you into federal service.

## Path 3: Private Sector (Tech, Finance, Consulting) — Highest Ceiling

Private sector companies need intelligence analysts for:
- **Cyber threat intelligence** (tech companies, banks, defense firms)
- **Corporate security** (Fortune 500 companies)
- **Financial intelligence** (anti-money laundering, fraud detection)
- **Consulting** (strategy firms, risk advisory)

The private sector pays the most but often doesn't require a clearance after initial hire. You're using intelligence analysis skills in a corporate setting.

### Salary Ranges

**Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst:**
- Entry: $80K-$100K
- Mid: $110K-$140K
- Senior: $140K-$180K

**Corporate Intelligence Analyst (Fortune 500):**
- Entry: $70K-$90K
- Mid: $95K-$130K
- Senior: $130K-$170K

**Financial Intelligence Analyst (Banking/FinTech):**
- Entry: $75K-$95K
- Mid: $100K-$135K
- Senior: $140K-$180K+

**Management Consulting (Deloitte, Accenture, etc.):**
- Entry: $80K-$105K
- Mid: $120K-$160K
- Senior: $180K-$250K+

### Top Employers for 35Fs in Private Sector

- Stock options and bonuses (can add 20-50% to total comp)
- Modern office environments and perks
- Career mobility (easier to switch companies)
- Less reliance on clearance (once you're in)

**Cons:**
- Less military culture (can feel like a bigger transition)
- Your clearance may not be used or maintained
- More competitive hiring (you're up against civilian analysts and tech talent)
- Steeper learning curve (corporate environment, different tools)

**Best for:** 35Fs who want the highest earning potential and are comfortable leaving the defense/intelligence world.

### How to Break Into Private Sector

**1. Translate your skills**

Don't call yourself a "35F" or "intelligence analyst" on your resume. Use private sector terms:
- Threat Intelligence Analyst
- Cyber Threat Researcher
- Security Analyst
- Risk Analyst
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Analyst

**2. Highlight transferable skills:**
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Threat assessment and risk evaluation
- Report writing and executive briefings
- Multi-source research and synthesis
- Critical thinking and problem-solving

**3. Get civilian-friendly certifications**

Private sector loves certifications (more below). Get:
- Security+ or CySA+ (cybersecurity basics)
- GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI)
- CISSP (if you can meet experience requirements)

**4. Build an online portfolio**

Show your analytical skills:
- Write blog posts analyzing cyber threats or geopolitical events
- Contribute to open-source intelligence (OSINT) projects
- Build a GitHub with Python scripts for data analysis
- Post on LinkedIn about intelligence analysis trends

**5. Network like crazy**

Private sector hiring is 60%+ referrals. Go to:
- Cybersecurity conferences (Black Hat, DEF CON, RSA)
- Veteran networking events in tech hubs (San Francisco, Austin, NYC)
- LinkedIn groups for intelligence professionals

## Certifications That Increase Your Value

Certifications can boost your salary by $5K-$15K and make you more competitive. Here are the ones that matter for 35Fs:

### Must-Have Certifications

**Security+ (CompTIA)**
- Cost: $400
- Time: 2-4 weeks of study
- Why: Required by DoD 8570.01-M for many contractor roles
- Salary boost: $5K-$10K

**What it covers:** Basic cybersecurity principles, network security, threats, and vulnerabilities

**How to get it:** Use vouchers from military Credentialing Assistance (CA) program before you separate (FREE). Otherwise, self-study with Professor Messer (YouTube) or Udemy courses, then schedule exam.

### High-Value Certifications

**GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI)**
- Cost: $2,000+
- Time: 3-6 months
- Why: Gold standard for threat intelligence analysts
- Salary boost: $10K-$20K

- Time: 3-6 months
- Why: Widely recognized, opens doors to senior roles
- Salary boost: $15K-$25K
- Requirement: 5 years of experience in security (can waive 1 year with degree)

**GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)**
- Cost: $2,000+
- Time: 2-4 months
- Why: Intermediate security knowledge, respected in government and contracting

### Niche Certifications (for specialization)

**GEOINT-specific:**
- **GEOINT Professional (GP)** – USGIF certification for GEOINT analysts

**SIGINT-specific:**
- No civilian equivalent, but NSA/CSS training is recognized

**All-source:**
- **Certified Intelligence Professional (CIP)** – AFIO certification

**Cyber focus:**
- **CySA+ (CompTIA)** – Cybersecurity Analyst
- **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** – Offensive security basics

**Bottom line:** Get Security+ before you separate (use your military TA or CA). Then pursue GCTI or CISSP within 2-3 years for maximum salary impact.

## Geographic Hotspots: Where the Jobs Are

## Your 90-Day Transition Plan

### Days 1-30: Assess and Prepare

**Week 1-2:**
- Update your LinkedIn (headline: "Intelligence Analyst | TS/SCI | 35F | All-Source Analysis")
- Create a ClearanceJobs.com profile
- Request your JST (Joint Services Transcript) to see what college credits you have
- Sign up for Security+ exam using military Credentialing Assistance (FREE)

**Week 3-4:**
- Research target companies (Booz Allen, Leidos, CACI, DIA, NSA)
- Start studying for Security+ (2-3 hours/day)
- Identify 2-3 target locations (DC, Tampa, San Antonio, etc.)
- Connect with 10+ intelligence professionals on LinkedIn

### Days 31-60: Apply and Network

**Week 5-6:**
- Take and pass Security+ exam
- Write your resume targeting contractors and federal jobs (two versions)
- Apply to 20+ positions on ClearanceJobs and USAJOBS
- Attend virtual or in-person military hiring events

**Week 7-8:**
- Continue applying (5-10 new jobs per week)
- Reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn
- Prepare for interviews (practice STAR method answers)
- Research typical interview questions for intelligence analysts

### Days 61-90: Interview and Decide

**Week 9-10:**
- Attend interviews (phone screens, technical interviews, panel interviews)
- Negotiate salary (know your market value: $75K-$95K entry level)
- Follow up with thank-you emails
- Keep applying until you have a signed offer

**Week 11-12:**
- Accept your offer
- Finalize your ETS/separation paperwork
- Relocate if needed (many companies offer relocation assistance)
- Transition to civilian employment

## Common Mistakes 35Fs Make (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Letting Your Clearance Lapse
**The fix:** Apply for jobs 90-120 days before separation. Get hired before your clearance goes inactive.

### Mistake #2: Only Applying to Jobs in One Location
**The fix:** Be geographically flexible early in your career. You can relocate later with experience.

### Mistake #3: Using Military Jargon on Resumes
**The fix:** Translate 35F duties into civilian terms. "All-source intelligence analyst" instead of "35F."

### Mistake #4: Waiting Until After Separation to Get Certifications
**The fix:** Use Credentialing Assistance (CA) to get Security+ for FREE before you ETS.

### Mistake #5: Expecting $100K+ Right Out of the Gate
**The fix:** Realistic expectations. Entry-level cleared analysts start at $70K-$90K. You'll hit six figures within 3-5 years.

### Mistake #6: Ignoring Federal Jobs Because of Lower Starting Pay
**The fix:** Run the lifetime numbers. Federal pension + TSP + steady raises = $2M+ lifetime earnings. Contractors might make more annually but have less security.

### Mistake #7: Not Networking
**The fix:** 60% of jobs are filled via referrals. Connect with veterans at target companies. One conversation can land you a job.

## Bottom Line: Your Clearance Is Your Competitive Advantage

Your TS/SCI clearance gives you a 2-year head start over civilian analysts. Use it.

Whether you go contractor, federal, or private sector, you're looking at:
- $75K-$95K starting salary (often more with experience and certs)
- $110K-$150K within 5-7 years
- $150K-$200K+ at senior levels (especially in private sector or management)

Your 35F experience translates directly to civilian intelligence work. You've done the hard part—operational intelligence under pressure, mission-critical analysis, working with classified systems.

Now it's about positioning yourself correctly, getting the right certifications, and choosing the path that fits your priorities: highest pay (contractor/private), most stability (federal), or best long-term growth (private sector).

Don't let your clearance lapse. Don't undersell your experience. And don't wait—start applying now.
