## Education Benefits for Washington Veterans

**Not covered:**
- Out-of-state tuition (must establish WA residency first)
- Books, supplies, housing, meals
- Private colleges (state waiver doesn't apply)

**How it works at major schools:**

**University of Washington (UW):**
- 50% tuition waiver for eligible veterans
- 2024-25 tuition: $12,092 (resident undergrad)
- With waiver: **$6,046** (saves $6,046/year)

- Website: washington.edu/veterans
- Phone: (206) 543-9307

**Washington State University (WSU):**
- 50% partial tuition waiver for veterans who have exhausted VA benefits or benefits don't cover 100%
- 2024-25 tuition: $12,022 (resident undergrad)
- With waiver: **$6,011** (saves $6,011/year)
- Apply through WSU Veterans & Military Affiliated Student Services
- Website: va.wsu.edu
- Phone: (509) 335-8654 (Pullman), (360) 546-9508 (Vancouver)

**Community and technical colleges:**
- Each college operates its own waiver program
- Typical annual tuition: $4,000-6,000
- With 50% waiver: **$2,000-3,000**

**Application deadlines:**
- Vary by institution
- Generally must apply each academic year
- Waivers submitted after the last day of instruction apply to the next term

**Combining with GI Bill:**
- You can use GI Bill benefits AND the state tuition waiver
- GI Bill covers remaining 50% of tuition + BAH + books
- Example: 100% GI Bill + 50% state waiver = 150% coverage, GI Bill pays BAH and books, waiver reduces tuition cost allowing you to stretch GI Bill benefits over more terms

### 100% Tuition Waiver for Dependents of Disabled/Deceased Veterans

This is **the big one**. Washington state requires public colleges to waive **all tuition and fees** for dependents of eligible veterans.

**Eligibility (dependents must be):**
- Child, spouse, or domestic partner of an eligible veteran or National Guard member who:
  - **Became totally disabled** (100% P&T) as a result of service, OR
  - **Lost their life** while engaged in active federal service, OR
  - **Is a POW or missing in action** as determined by federal government

**What's covered:**
- **100% of tuition and fees** (not books, housing, or supplies)
- Undergraduate programs only
- Up to 200 quarter credits or equivalent semester credits
- All Washington public colleges and universities (UW, WSU, community colleges, technical colleges)

**Real-world value:**
- UW Seattle tuition (2024-25): $12,092/year x 4 years = **$48,368 saved**
- WSU tuition (2024-25): $12,022/year x 4 years = **$48,088 saved**
- Community college tuition: $4,500/year x 2 years = **$9,000 saved**

**Who qualifies as a dependent:**
- Biological or adopted children
- Spouse (married to veteran at time of disability/death)
- Domestic partner (registered with state)

**Age/time limits:**
- Must be used before dependent turns 30 years old
- 200 quarter credit maximum (approximately 4 years of full-time study)

**How to apply:**

**At UW:**
- Contact UW Veterans & Military Programs
- Provide veteran's DD Form 214
- Provide VA letter confirming 100% P&T rating or death in service
- Proof of relationship (birth certificate, marriage certificate)
- Complete UW waiver application

- Find your college: sbctc.edu (State Board for Community and Technical Colleges)

**Can dependents use GI Bill AND the 100% waiver?**
- **No.** The waiver covers tuition fully.
- Instead, dependents should use **transferred GI Bill** (if veteran transferred benefits) for housing allowance and book stipend ONLY
- This maximizes benefit value: Free tuition from state + $1,000-2,000/month BAH from GI Bill

**Example:** Child of 100% disabled veteran at UW Seattle:
- Tuition: $12,092/year (waived by state)
- Transferred GI Bill covers: $2,200/month BAH (9 months) = $19,800/year
- Books: $1,000/year from GI Bill
- **Total annual value: $32,892**—almost all tax-free

- State program for low-income students
- Sign up in 7th or 8th grade

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Healthcare Questions

**Q: How do I choose between VA Puget Sound Seattle or American Lake (Tacoma)?**

A: Waitlists vary by facility and change frequently. Orting and Port Orchard (Retsil) sometimes have short waits; Spokane varies. Contact admissions for current wait times.

**Q: What level of care is provided?**
A: All three homes provide skilled nursing care (24-hour medical care). This is for veterans who need daily medical assistance, not independent living. Some assisted living is available at Retsil.

### Education Questions

**Q: I already used my GI Bill. Can I still get the Washington tuition waiver?**
A: Yes. The state tuition waiver is separate from GI Bill benefits. You can receive the 50% tuition waiver even if you've exhausted GI Bill.

**Q: Do I have to be a Washington resident to get the tuition waiver?**
A: Yes. You must establish Washington state residency. If you're separating from JBLM, you may already be a resident. Check with the college residency office.

**Q: Can my kids get the 100% dependent tuition waiver if I'm 90% disabled?**
A: Only if you have a **total disability rating** for service-connected disability. 100% schedular or TDIU typically qualifies. 90% usually does not unless accompanied by "total disability" designation. Check your VA rating letter or contact the school.

**Q: Can my spouse use the 100% dependent waiver?**
A: Yes, if you're 100% P&T disabled or died from service-connected conditions and they were your spouse at the time of the disability/death.

**Q: Does the waiver cover graduate school?**
A: The 50% veteran waiver covers graduate programs. The 100% dependent waiver covers **undergraduate only** (up to 200 quarter credits).

**Q: Can dependents use the tuition waiver at private colleges like Seattle University?**
A: No. The state waiver only applies to Washington **public** colleges and universities (UW, WSU, community colleges, Evergreen State, Western Washington University, etc.).

**Q: What if my child is attending out-of-state? Can they use the waiver?**
A: No. The waiver is only valid at Washington state public institutions.

**Q: Is the 100% dependent waiver the same as the Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer?**
A: No. They're separate. The state waiver covers tuition only. Transferred GI Bill covers tuition, housing (BAH), and books. Your dependent should use the state waiver for tuition (100% free) and GI Bill for housing/books to maximize benefits.
