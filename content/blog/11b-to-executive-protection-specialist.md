## Why 11B Infantry Veterans Excel in Executive Protection

Every infantry soldier researching civilian careers gets told: "Your combat skills don't translate." "Security is just standing around." "You'll need to start from scratch."

Here's what the data actually shows: **Infantry veterans are the most sought-after candidates in executive protection.**

You didn't just "carry a rifle." You:
- Conducted detailed threat assessments in hostile environments

That's not "military experience" - that's advanced protective services work. Every executive protection company wants agents who can assess threats, react instantly, work as a team, maintain composure, and understand tactical operations. You've been doing this for years.

Companies like Constellis, Triple Canopy, GardaWorld, and SOC actively hire infantry veterans. Preference given to recent combat deployments and maintained security clearances.

## The Skills Gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest about civilian executive protection differences:

**Customer service and communication:** You're protecting clients, not executing combat missions. Client interaction requires diplomacy, professionalism, and discretion. Less "direct orders," more "courteous security advice."

**Legal boundaries and use of force:** Civilian use of force laws are different from ROE. You need to understand self-defense laws, citizen's arrest, liability, and when you can/cannot engage. Training covers this extensively.

**Low-profile operations:** Most corporate EP is "gray man" - blend in, don't draw attention. Not combat loadout and aggressive posturing. Suit and tie, concealed weapon, professional demeanor.

**Advance work and logistics:** EP involves extensive pre-planning: route reconnaissance, site surveys, hospital locations, threat assessments. Less reactive than infantry operations, more preventative planning.

**Client management:** Some clients cooperate with security, others resist. You'll need patience and persuasion skills to manage difficult principals who don't want visible security.

**State laws and licensing:** Every state has different security licensing requirements, concealed carry laws, and use of force standards. Research before relocating.

## Salary Progression Timeline

**Years 4-5:** Senior EP specialist or security manager: $95,000-$120,000

**Alternative high-earning path:** Private contracting Year 1-3: $120,000-$180,000+ (but with significant time overseas)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1:** Not getting professional EP training. State security licenses alone don't make you competitive for high-paying EP work. Invest in recognized EP training.

**Mistake #2:** Focusing only on contracting. While overseas contracting pays well, it's not sustainable long-term. Build domestic experience for career longevity.

**Mistake #3:** Ignoring corporate security paths. EP work is competitive; corporate security management offers stable six-figure careers with better work-life balance.

**Mistake #4:** Poor civilian communication skills. Aggressive military bearing doesn't work in corporate EP. Practice professional, courteous client interaction.

**Mistake #5:** Not maintaining security clearance. If you have Secret/TS clearance, maintain it. Cleared EP positions pay 20-30% more and have less competition.

## Bottom Line for 11B Infantry Veterans

Your infantry experience is exactly what executive protection companies want.

Threat assessment, tactical operations, weapons proficiency, team coordination, emergency response - these aren't "military skills," they're core protective services competencies worth $75K-$150K+ annually in civilian markets.

The EP industry was built by and for military veterans. Companies actively recruit infantry backgrounds. Your combat deployments are assets, not obstacles.

Entry paths are clear: get state security license (2-6 weeks), complete professional EP training (1-2 weeks), start at $55K-$75K entry positions. Within 3-5 years, experienced EP specialists earn $85K-$120K. Within 10 years, security directors and senior agents hit $150K+.

Alternative high-income path: private contracting pays $120K-$180K+ immediately but requires returning to hostile environments.

Federal law enforcement (DSS, FBI, DEA, Marshals) offers stable six-figure careers with full benefits for veterans with bachelor's degrees.

Corporate security management provides leadership roles at $100K-$200K+ for infantry NCOs who want to leverage tactical expertise without constant field work.

You're not starting over. You're translating proven tactical skills into civilian protective services careers. Thousands of infantry veterans are already earning six figures doing exactly this work.

The demand is real. The pathway is clear. The earnings are substantial.

Your infantry experience isn't just valuable - it's the foundation of a high-paying security career.
