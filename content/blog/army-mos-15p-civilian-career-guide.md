## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 15P Aviation Operations Specialists transitioning out—you're not just a scheduler and dispatcher, you're an aviation operations professional with hands-on experience managing complex flight missions, coordinating aircraft movements, processing flight plans, maintaining operational readiness, and ensuring regulatory compliance under high-pressure conditions. Your **expertise in mission planning and coordination, flight following and tracking, weather analysis and briefings, NOTAMs and airspace restrictions, weight and balance calculations, fuel planning, communications center operations, and operational documentation** make you highly valuable in commercial aviation dispatch, airport operations, and flight operations management. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$65,000** for airport operations coordinators or entry-level dispatch positions, scaling to **$75,000-$100,000** with FAA Aircraft Dispatcher certification at regional/major airlines, and reaching **$100,000-$170,000+** as senior dispatchers at major airlines or aviation operations managers within 5-10 years. Top-tier aircraft dispatchers at Delta, American, or United with 10+ years experience can earn **$150,000-$200,000+**. You've got proven operations expertise—now convert it to FAA credentials and civilian aviation careers.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 15P separating hears two conflicting messages: "Your military experience is perfect for airline dispatch—they'll hire you immediately," and "Without FAA dispatcher certification, you're competing with hundreds of other applicants for entry-level coordinator jobs."

Both statements contain truth. Here's the reality: **Your military aviation operations experience translates directly to civilian flight operations, dispatch, and airport management—but the FAA Aircraft Dispatcher Certificate is your accelerator to premium airline positions.**

You didn't just "schedule flights and answer phones." You:
- Planned and coordinated tactical aviation missions involving 5-15 aircraft across multiple locations
- Processed flight plans, calculated fuel requirements, analyzed weather, and briefed aircrews on mission-critical information
- Monitored real-time flight operations and tracked aircraft movements using military flight following systems
- Coordinated with Air Traffic Control, tower personnel, meteorology, and maintenance for safe flight operations
- Maintained operational logs, DA forms, flight records, and regulatory documentation meeting Army aviation standards
- Analyzed NOTAMs, temporary flight restrictions, airspace restrictions, and special use airspace
- Performed weight and balance calculations for various aircraft configurations and mission loads
- Responded to in-flight emergencies, diversions, and operational changes under time pressure
- Maintained 24/7 operations center supporting aviation battalions with zero safety incidents

That's operational planning, risk management, regulatory compliance, real-time decision making, and safety-critical coordination. Airlines, corporate aviation, airports, and defense contractors need exactly that—you just need to translate your military operations experience into civilian aviation terminology and credentials.

## Best civilian career paths for 15P Aviation Operations Specialists

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where 15Ps consistently land, with real 2024-2025 salary data.

### Aircraft dispatcher (highest paying direct path)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Aircraft Dispatcher (also called Flight Dispatcher or Flight Operations Officer)
- Flight Dispatcher
- Flight Operations Officer
- Senior Dispatcher
- Chief Dispatcher

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level dispatcher (regional airlines):** $50,000-$65,000

- Route planning and fuel calculations
- Weight and balance computations
- NOTAMs, TFRs, and airspace restriction analysis
- Real-time flight monitoring and decision making
- Emergency response and diversion planning
- Crew coordination and briefings
- Regulatory compliance and documentation

**Certifications needed:**
- **FAA Aircraft Dispatcher Certificate** (required—discussed in detail below)
  - Cost: $4,000-$8,000 for 5-6 week accelerated program
  - GI Bill eligible (covers 60% under Montgomery GI Bill; variable under Post-9/11 GI Bill)
  - Requirements: Age 23 (can test at 21), 200 hours training, pass written + practical exams
  - Testing fees: $175 written + $550-$600 practical = $725-$775
- **Bachelor's degree** (preferred by major airlines, not required)
- **FCC Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit** (some airlines require—$65, online test)

**Reality check:**
Aircraft dispatchers share legal responsibility with pilots for every flight—you're the "pilot on the ground." You plan routes, calculate fuel, analyze weather, monitor flights, and make go/no-go decisions. It's high responsibility and excellent pay.

Major airlines like **Delta, American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, and FedEx** employ aircraft dispatchers. At American Airlines, dispatchers average $103,951 (range $38K-$201K depending on seniority). At Delta, dispatchers earn $85,000-$170,000+ depending on experience, with some earning up to $184,330 at top seniority.

Regional airlines (SkyWest, Republic Airways, Endeavor Air, PSA Airlines) hire at lower starting salaries ($50K-$65K) but offer excellent training and experience to move up to majors.

**Your 15P experience is extremely relevant**—you've done nearly identical work in a military context. The FAA dispatcher course teaches you civilian regulations (FARs), commercial aircraft performance, civilian meteorology formats, and airline operational procedures. The skills you already have (mission planning, weather analysis, operational coordination) translate directly.

Major airlines prefer hiring dispatchers with aviation backgrounds—military aviation operations specialists are highly valued. Some airlines like **Piedmont Airlines and Republic Airways** have military transition programs specifically targeting veterans.

The lifestyle is shift work (24/7/365 operations), often working 8-12 hour shifts including nights, weekends, and holidays. But pay is excellent, benefits are strong (flight benefits!), and job security at major airlines is solid.

**Best for:** 15Ps who want high-responsibility aviation careers with excellent pay, enjoy operational planning and real-time decision making, want to stay in aviation operations, and are willing to invest in FAA dispatcher certification.

### Airport operations coordinator/specialist

- **Valid driver's license** (required—you'll drive on the airfield)
- **Security clearance/background check** (required—SIDA badge)
- **Airport-specific training** (provided after hiring)

**Reality check:**
Airport operations coordinators ensure safe, efficient airport operations. You conduct airfield inspections (checking runways, taxiways, lighting), respond to emergencies (aircraft incidents, disabled vehicles, wildlife), coordinate snow removal and maintenance, ensure regulatory compliance (FAA Part 139), and serve as liaison between airlines, ATC, and airport tenants.

Major hub airports (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, O'Hare Chicago, DFW Dallas, LAX Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix) employ 10-30+ operations specialists working 24/7 shifts. Pay scales higher at major hubs—**Houston Airport System** pays $62,296-$75,941; **Charlotte Douglas International** pays $60,022-$70,028.

Smaller regional airports employ 2-5 operations staff with lower pay but often better schedules and quality of life.

The work is active—you're driving the airfield, conducting inspections, responding to situations. It's not a desk job. You work in all weather conditions and must be available for emergency callouts.

**Benefits include:** stable government/municipal employment (most airports are government-owned), pension plans, excellent benefits, and free airport parking (not trivial at major hubs!).

**Best for:** 15Ps who want hands-on operational work, prefer working outdoors and driving vs. desk-bound, enjoy coordinating multiple stakeholders, and want government employment stability with reasonable work-life balance.

- Coordination with FBOs, vendors, and service providers

**Certifications needed:**
- **High school diploma or associate's degree** (minimum)
- **Bachelor's degree** (preferred for corporate aviation)
- **Aircraft Dispatcher Certificate** (helpful but not always required)
- **Company-specific training** (provided after hiring)

**Reality check:**
Flight operations coordinators work for corporate flight departments, helicopter operators (medical transport, offshore oil/gas, tourism), cargo operators, and charter companies. You're scheduling aircraft, tracking flights, coordinating maintenance, managing crew schedules, and ensuring smooth operations.

**Corporate aviation** (companies like **NetJets, Flexjet, Wheels Up, VistaJet, and private corporate flight departments at Fortune 500 companies**) employ flight operations coordinators to support their business jet fleets. Pay is moderate but lifestyle is typically better than airlines—more predictable schedules, professional office environments, and interaction with executives and high-net-worth clients.

**Helicopter operations** include **Air Methods, PHI Air Medical, REACH Air Medical** (medical transport), offshore operators supporting oil/gas in Gulf of Mexico, and tourism operators. These are smaller operations (10-50 aircraft fleets) with tight-knit teams.

**Cargo operators** like **FedEx, UPS, DHL, and regional cargo carriers** need operations coordinators for their networks.

The work is often desk-based with regular business hours (Monday-Friday, day shifts), though some 24/7 operations require shift work. Pay is lower than airline dispatchers but work-life balance is often better.

**Best for:** 15Ps who prefer smaller operations with more personal interaction, want predictable schedules and day shifts, enjoy customer service and relationship building, or want to work in business aviation/corporate environments.

### Aviation operations manager (FBO/general aviation)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Associate's or Bachelor's degree** (preferred)
- **Management experience** (military supervisory experience counts)
- **A&P Certificate or Dispatcher Certificate** (helpful but not required)
- **NATA FBO Management Certificate** (can pursue after gaining experience)

**Reality check:**
FBOs (Fixed Base Operators) are the "gas stations" of general aviation—they provide fuel, hangar space, aircraft maintenance, passenger services, and flight planning for private, corporate, and charter aircraft. FBO operations managers oversee daily operations, manage staff (line service, customer service, maintenance coordination), ensure safety and compliance, and handle customer relations.

Major FBO chains include **Signature Flight Support, Atlantic Aviation, Million Air, Ross Aviation, Sheltair, and TAC Air**. These companies operate FBOs at hundreds of airports nationwide.

FBO operations coordinator is often an entry-level position ($40K-$55K) learning the business. After 2-3 years, you can advance to operations manager ($55K-$85K+) running the FBO.

The work involves customer service (greeting aircraft, coordinating services), operational coordination (fueling, catering, ground transportation), staff management, and facility oversight. It's fast-paced, customer-focused, and requires flexibility.

General aviation operations managers work for flight schools, aircraft management companies, maintenance facilities, and smaller aviation businesses. These positions combine operational expertise with business management.

**Best for:** 15Ps interested in general aviation vs. airlines, who enjoy customer service and relationship building, want management experience and business operations exposure, and prefer working at smaller operations where you wear multiple hats.

### DOD/Government civilian aviation operations

**Civilian job titles:**
- DOD Civilian Aviation Operations Specialist
- Army Civilian Aviation Operations Coordinator
- Air Force Civilian Airfield Operations Specialist
- Contract Flight Operations Specialist (supporting DOD)
- FAA Operations Specialist

**Salary ranges:**
- **GS-7/GS-9 entry-level aviation operations:** $45,000-$60,000
- **GS-9/GS-11 operations specialist:** $55,000-$80,000
- **GS-11/GS-12 senior operations specialist:** $70,000-$95,000
- **GS-12/GS-13 operations manager/supervisor:** $85,000-$115,000
- **GS-13/GS-14 senior manager:** $105,000-$135,000
- **Defense contractor operations specialist:** $65,000-$95,000

**What translates directly:**
Everything—you're doing identical work as a civilian employee supporting military aviation.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Security clearance** (if still active—huge advantage)
- **Bachelor's degree** (preferred for GS-11 and above)
- **Relevant certifications** (Dispatcher, airport operations helpful)
- **Veteran preference** (applies to federal hiring—gives you priority)

**Reality check:**
DOD civilian positions at military installations (Army airfields, Air Force bases, joint installations) need aviation operations specialists to support military flying operations. You'd be doing the same work you did in uniform—mission planning, flight coordination, operations center management—but as a federal civilian employee.

**Benefits include:** federal GS pay scale with predictable raises, FERS retirement system, TSP matching, comprehensive federal benefits, job security, and veteran hiring preference (gives you major advantage).

The **Air Force Civilian Service (AFCS)** actively recruits former military aviation operations specialists for airfield operations positions worldwide. Army and Navy also hire civilian aviation operations personnel at installations.

**Defense contractors** like **Booz Allen Hamilton, SAIC, Leidos, CACI, and ManTech** support DOD aviation operations and hire former military aviation operations specialists for contractor positions at military installations. Contractor pay is often higher than GS equivalent but without federal benefits/retirement.

**FAA** employs operations specialists supporting FAA facilities, though these positions are competitive and often require specialized experience or certifications.

**Best for:** 15Ps who want to continue supporting military aviation as civilians, value federal benefits and job security, prefer familiar military installation environments, or want to leverage active security clearance for immediate hiring advantage.

### Air traffic control (with additional training)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Air Traffic Control Specialist (FAA)
- Tower Controller
- Approach/Departure Controller
- En Route Controller
- Contract Tower Controller

**Salary ranges:**
- **FAA ATC trainee (Academy):** $40,000-$50,000
- **FAA developmental controller:** $60,000-$90,000
- **FAA certified professional controller (CPC):** $90,000-$140,000
- **FAA senior controller (high-level facilities):** $140,000-$185,000+
- **Contract tower controller:** $50,000-$85,000

**What translates directly:**
- Aviation operations knowledge and terminology
- Airspace management understanding
- Situational awareness and multi-tasking ability
- Radio communication skills
- Weather interpretation and decision making
- Emergency response and prioritization

**Certifications needed:**
- **FAA Air Traffic Control Specialist certification** (provided through FAA Academy after hiring)
- **Pass FAA ATC application process** (biographical questionnaire, ATSA test, medical exam)
- **Age requirement:** Must be hired before age 31 (veterans get additional time—generally can apply up to age 36)
- **3 years work experience OR bachelor's degree OR combination**
- **Security clearance**

**Reality check:**
This path requires starting over with FAA training, but former military aviation operations specialists have strong advantages in the hiring process. The FAA values military aviation experience and gives veteran preference points.

**The process:**
1. Apply through USA Jobs when FAA posts ATC openings (typically annually)
2. Complete biographical questionnaire (veteran points help)
3. Pass ATSA (Air Traffic Skills Assessment) computerized test
4. Pass medical examination and security clearance
5. Attend FAA Academy in Oklahoma City (3-5 months, paid training)
6. Complete facility training at assigned location (1-3 years as developmental controller)
7. Achieve CPC (Certified Professional Controller) status

**Pay is excellent** once certified ($90K-$185K+) with federal benefits and retirement. But the training process is rigorous (30-50% washout rate at Academy), and you have no control over initial facility assignment—FAA sends you where they need controllers (could be anywhere in the US).

The job is high-stress, high-responsibility, and mentally demanding—but aviation operations specialists often excel because you understand aviation operations, can multi-task under pressure, and are accustomed to high-stress environments.

**Best for:** 15Ps under age 31 (or 36 with veteran time), who want top-tier federal aviation careers with excellent pay, are willing to attend Academy training and accept initial assignment anywhere in US, and thrive in high-pressure, high-responsibility environments.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "15P Aviation Operations Specialist" and assuming civilians know what that means. Translate it:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 15P Aviation Operations Specialist | Aviation operations coordinator with 4+ years planning and coordinating tactical flight operations for battalion-level aviation units |
| Mission planning and coordination | Planned 200+ complex flight missions analyzing weather, airspace, fuel requirements, and operational risks; ensured 98% mission success rate |
| Flight following and tracking | Monitored real-time flight operations for 10-15 aircraft simultaneously using flight tracking systems; coordinated diversions and emergency responses |
| Weather briefings and analysis | Analyzed TAFs, METARs, weather radar, and forecast products; briefed aircrews on mission-critical weather impacts and operational risks |
| NOTAMs and airspace analysis | Reviewed NOTAMs, TFRs, and special use airspace; identified conflicts and briefed aircrews on restrictions and operational impacts |
| Weight and balance calculations | Performed weight and balance calculations for UH-60/AH-64/CH-47 aircraft across varied mission configurations ensuring safe operating limits |
| Fuel planning | Calculated fuel requirements for tactical missions considering distance, payload, weather, reserves, and alternate airports |
| Operations center management | Supervised 24/7 tactical operations center coordinating flight schedules, maintenance, crew availability, and mission priorities |
| Regulatory compliance | Maintained flight records, DA forms, and operational documentation meeting Army aviation regulatory standards (converts to FAA Part 91/135/121) |
| Crew coordination and briefings | Briefed 50+ aircrews on mission requirements, weather hazards, airspace restrictions, and emergency procedures using clear, concise communication |

Use **quantifiable results**: "Coordinated 500+ flight operations over 2-year period with zero safety incidents," "Managed operations center supporting 25 aircraft and 40 aviators with 99.2% mission-capable rate," "Processed 300+ flight plans with 100% accuracy in weather, fuel, and weight-balance calculations."

Drop military jargon. Don't write "OPORD," "PACE plan," or "9-line"—write "operations order," "primary-alternate-contingency-emergency planning," and "standardized emergency report format." Civilians don't know "DA Form 5484" but they understand "flight operations record" or "flight risk assessment documentation."

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill as a 15P:

### High priority (get these):

**FAA Aircraft Dispatcher Certificate** - This is your premium ticket to airline dispatch careers earning $75K-$200K+. The fastest path to high-paying aviation operations jobs. Cost: $4,000-$8,000 for 5-6 week intensive program; GI Bill covers 60% (Montgomery) or variable amount (Post-9/11). Testing fees: $175 written + $550-$600 practical = $725-$775 total. Time: 5-6 weeks full-time or 3-6 months part-time. Value: Opens $75K-$200K airline dispatcher career path; required by all commercial airlines.

**Where to get FAA Dispatcher Certificate:**
- **Sheffield School of Aeronautics** (online and in-person, veteran-friendly, $4,995)
- **Jeppesen (Boeing subsidiary)** (online, self-paced, $5,295)
- **Airlines Dispatcher Training Center (Dallas)** (5-week intensive, $5,500)
- **Mt. San Antonio College** (California, lower cost community college program)
- **Ohio State University** (8-week program)

Many programs are GI Bill approved. Some airlines have partnerships with specific schools and recruit directly from their graduates.

**Bachelor's degree (any field, but Aviation Management/Business preferred)** - Preferred (not required) by major airlines for dispatcher positions; required for management track at airports and aviation companies. Cost: GI Bill covers. Time: 4 years (or 2-3 with transfer credits). Value: Opens management positions and enhances competitiveness for major airline jobs.

**AAAE Airport Operations Certificate** - Industry certification for airport operations professionals. Cost: $1,200-$2,500 depending on level (Certified Member = $1,200; Accredited Airport Executive = $2,500). Time: Self-study + exam (can pursue while working). Value: Professional credibility for airport operations positions; not required but strengthens resume.

### Medium priority (if it fits your path):

**FCC Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit** - Required by some airlines for dispatcher positions. Cost: $65. Time: 1 hour online test. Value: Simple requirement for some dispatcher jobs; easy to obtain.

**Private Pilot Certificate** - Helpful for understanding flight operations from pilot perspective. Not required but valued by airlines. Cost: $8,000-$12,000. Time: 3-6 months. Value: Demonstrates commitment to aviation; helpful for dispatcher career but expensive investment.

**Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)** - If you have commercial pilot certificate or want to become flight instructor. Opens flight instruction career path. Cost: $3,000-$5,000 (if you're already a commercial pilot). Value: Alternative aviation career path; good for networking in aviation industry.

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - If targeting aviation operations management or corporate roles. Cost: $500-$3,000 for prep and exam. Value: Strengthens credentials for management positions in aviation operations.

### Low priority (nice to have, not critical):

**Drone/UAS certifications** - Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate for commercial drone operations. Cost: $175. Value: Growing field but not directly related to traditional aviation operations.

**Lean Six Sigma or similar** - If targeting process improvement or management consulting in aviation. Cost: $1,000-$3,000. Value: Useful for corporate aviation management roles.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be brutally honest. There are civilian aviation skills you'll need to develop:

**Commercial aviation regulations:** Military aviation follows Army aviation regulations (AR 95-series) and TMs. Civilian aviation follows **14 CFR (Federal Aviation Regulations)**, particularly Part 91 (general aviation), Part 121 (airline operations), Part 135 (charter/commuter operations), and Part 139 (airports). These are completely different regulatory frameworks—you'll learn them in dispatcher school or on the job, but familiarize yourself early. They're free online at faa.gov.

**Civilian aircraft performance:** Military helicopters (UH-60, AH-64, CH-47) have different performance characteristics than Boeing 737s, Airbus A320s, or Embraer regional jets. Dispatcher school teaches commercial aircraft performance, but you'll need to study specific aircraft types used by your employer.

**Airline operational systems:** Commercial airlines use complex computerized systems for flight planning, flight tracking, crew scheduling, and operational control. Systems like **Sabre, Jeppesen FliteDeck, Lido, Boeing Flight Operations, and proprietary airline systems** require training. Most is provided after hiring, but basic computer proficiency and willingness to learn complex software is essential.

**Customer service orientation:** Airlines and corporate aviation are customer-service businesses. Dispatchers coordinate with pilots (who are employees/contractors), work with schedulers, communicate with gate agents, and sometimes interact with passengers (indirectly). Professional communication, diplomacy, and service mindset matter. Military directness works with pilots (they prefer it), but corporate environments require softer communication styles.

**Union environment:** Major airlines are highly unionized. Dispatchers at major airlines are represented by the **Transport Workers Union (TWU)** or similar unions. Understand union culture, seniority systems, bidding for shifts/positions, and labor-management dynamics. It's very different from military culture—seniority often trumps merit, and systems are rigid.

**Shift work and irregular schedules:** Aviation operates 24/7/365. Expect shift work—swing shifts, night shifts, weekends, holidays. Major airlines use seniority bidding for schedules. Junior dispatchers get the worst shifts (overnight weekend shifts). After 5-10 years, you can bid for better schedules. Be prepared for irregular sleep schedules and missing family events until you gain seniority.

## Real Army 15P success stories

**Tyler, 27, former 15P (E-5) → United Airlines aircraft dispatcher**

### Months 5-6: Job search and interviews

- Apply to 30-50 positions across multiple paths: airline dispatch, airport operations, flight operations coordinators, DOD civilian, corporate aviation
- Target veteran-friendly companies: **American Airlines (7,000+ veterans), Delta (11% of 80,000 employees are veterans), United, Southwest, JetBlue (Vets in Blue program), Alaska Airlines**
- For dispatcher positions: Regional airlines (**SkyWest, Republic Airways, Endeavor Air, PSA Airlines, Horizon Air**) hire entry-level dispatchers; easier to get hired than majors
- For airport operations: Apply to major hub airports and regional airports; check **USA Jobs** for government airport positions
- Practice interviews using STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)—prepare stories about managing operations under pressure, responding to emergencies/diversions, coordinating multiple aircraft simultaneously
- Be ready to discuss: specific weather analysis you performed, weight-balance calculations, emergency situations you managed, how you prioritized competing demands
- For dispatcher interviews: Expect scenario-based questions testing decision making (weather diversion scenarios, fuel planning, go/no-go decisions)
- Be prepared to relocate—airline dispatch centers are at hubs (Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Charlotte); may need to relocate for best opportunities
- If offered regional airline position at lower pay: Consider it stepping stone to majors (2-3 years at regional, then apply to Delta/United/American)

## Bottom line for Army 15P Aviation Operations Specialists

Your 15P experience isn't just "scheduling and dispatching"—it's operational aviation expertise with direct civilian applications in commercial airlines, airports, corporate aviation, and aviation management.

You've proven you can plan complex flight operations under time pressure, analyze weather and airspace to ensure safe operations, coordinate multiple aircraft and stakeholders simultaneously, make real-time operational decisions, and maintain compliance with aviation regulations. The civilian aviation industry needs exactly those skills—airlines, airports, and aviation companies employ thousands of aviation operations professionals doing work nearly identical to your military role.

The **FAA Aircraft Dispatcher Certificate is your highest-ROI investment** if you want airline dispatch careers. At $4,000-$8,000 with GI Bill covering 60%+, it's 5-6 weeks of intensive training that unlocks $75K-$200K career potential. Major airline dispatchers earn $100K-$170K+ with excellent benefits and flight privileges.

If airline dispatch doesn't appeal, airport operations coordinator positions ($60K-$80K) offer stable government employment with pensions, active outdoor work, and reasonable schedules. Corporate/helicopter flight operations coordinator roles ($55K-$90K) provide good pay with better work-life balance than airlines.

First-year income of $50K-$75K is realistic at regional airlines, airports, or corporate aviation. With FAA dispatcher certification and 3-5 years experience at major airlines, $90K-$130K is very achievable. Top-of-scale dispatchers at legacy carriers earn $150K-$200K after 10+ years.

Your military aviation operations experience, operational decision-making skills, and ability to function under pressure make you a strong candidate for civilian aviation operations roles. Thousands of former military aviation operations specialists successfully transitioned before you—the industry actively recruits veterans and values military aviation backgrounds.

Document your experience thoroughly, consider FAA dispatcher certification seriously, target companies with veteran hiring programs, and execute your transition plan. You've coordinated complex flight operations in high-pressure military environments—civilian aviation operations is the natural career progression.
