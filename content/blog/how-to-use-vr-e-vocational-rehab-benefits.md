# How to Use VR&E Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

If you're service-connected disabled (rated by VA), you may qualify for VR&E (Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment), which covers up to 48 months of education/training for a career goal. Combined with GI Bill, you could receive 84+ months of education benefits. Most disabled veterans don't know about VR&E or how to access it, missing significant educational opportunities.

## Understanding VR&E Benefits

### What Is VR&E (Chapter 31)?

VR&E is VA benefit specifically for service-connected disabled veterans, providing:

- **Up to 48 months** of education/training
- **Tuition coverage** (full tuition to approved school)
- **Monthly stipend** while in training (similar to GI Bill housing allowance)
- **Book allowance** ($1,000/year)
- **Supplies/equipment** related to training
- **Job placement assistance** after training completion

### Who's Eligible for VR&E

**You must have:**
1. Service-connected disability rating from VA (5%+)
2. Disability interferes with employment or creates serious employment handicap
3. Entered service on/after September 16, 1981 (with some exceptions)

**You don't need:**
- GI Bill to use VR&E (separate program)
- Military education credentials
- Any specific military service length

### Service-Connected Rating Requirement

Most service-connected ratings qualify:

| Rating | VR&E Eligible |
|---|---|
| 0% | Usually not (but some cases yes) |
| 10% | Yes |
| 20% | Yes |
| 50%+ | Yes |

**Key Point:** Even 10% rating qualifies you. Your disability doesn't need to be severe.

## Step 1: Verify Eligibility and Establish Service Connection

**First: Confirm Service-Connected Rating**

1. Log into VA.gov
2. Check rating (should say "Service Connected")
3. Note disability rating percentage

**If not yet rated:**
1. File VA Disability Claim (VA Form 21-0966)
2. Undergo evaluation
3. Receive rating decision
4. Once rated, you're VR&E eligible

**Timeline for rating:** 3-6 months (sometimes longer)

## Step 2: Apply for VR&E
