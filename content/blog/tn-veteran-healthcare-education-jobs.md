# Tennessee Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Tennessee operates three major VA medical centers—Nashville, Memphis, and Mountain Home (near Johnson City)—plus the Alvin C. York campus in Murfreesboro and numerous community-based outpatient clinics statewide. The system serves 400,000+ veterans across Tennessee and adjacent states. Healthcare access is excellent in major metro areas (Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, Knoxville) with quality care, though rural veterans may drive 45-90 minutes to reach VA facilities.

For education, Tennessee offers exceptional state benefits: free tuition at state community colleges and universities for dependents of 100% disabled veterans, POWs, and Medal of Honor recipients—one of the best dependent education programs nationally. The University of Tennessee participates in Yellow Ribbon (limited programs), and Tennessee has strong GI Bill-approved schools including Vanderbilt (private, generous Yellow Ribbon), MTSU, UT system, and community colleges statewide.

Employment is strong, with Tennessee's overall unemployment at 3.5% (2025) and veteran unemployment tracking below national average. The state enacted guaranteed interview rights for veterans applying to state jobs in 2025, plus hiring preference when qualifications are equal. Major employers in Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Clarksville actively recruit veterans, particularly in healthcare, logistics, automotive manufacturing, and defense contracting.

Overall rating: **8/10** for healthcare (three major medical centers provide good coverage), **9/10** for education (exceptional dependent benefits and GI Bill schools), **8.5/10** for employment (strong job market with new state hiring preference).
