## Bottom Line Up Front

Navy AOs handle aviation weapons and ammunition—missiles, bombs, rockets, torpedoes, and the systems that deliver them. That's **specialized explosives expertise and weapons systems knowledge that translates directly to defense, law enforcement, and industrial sectors**. You've got hands-on experience with ordnance handling, explosive safety protocols, inventory management, and weapons loading systems. Realistic first-year civilian salaries range from **$46,000-$67,000**, with experienced professionals in ordnance roles hitting **$80,000-$110,000** at defense contractors. Government ammunition specialists and explosive technicians can reach **$90,000-$130,000**. Your biggest advantage? Explosives handling experience and security clearance. That combination opens doors most civilians can't access.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every AO looking at civilian jobs hits the same wall: "What the hell do I do with explosives experience in the civilian world?"

You tell people you loaded missiles and bombs on fighter jets and they look at you like you're unemployable outside the military.

Here's what they're missing: **your explosives handling and ordnance expertise is rare, regulated, and high-value.**

You didn't just "work with weapons." You:
- Assembled, loaded, and unloaded live ordnance following strict safety protocols
- Managed ammunition inventories worth millions of dollars
- Maintained complex weapons release and launching systems (mechanical and electrical)
- Handled explosive devices (primers, fuzes, warheads) with perfect safety record
- Followed technical manuals for weapons systems across multiple aircraft types
- Conducted detailed inspections and maintained meticulous documentation
- Operated forklifts, ordnance handling equipment, and loading systems
- Worked rotating shifts in high-stress environments (especially flight ops)
- Supervised junior personnel in dangerous operations

That's precision technical work, accountability, regulatory compliance, safety management, and logistics. Defense contractors, ammunition manufacturers, government agencies, mining/construction companies, and law enforcement need those exact skills. The civilian world has fewer people qualified to handle explosives than positions available.

You're not starting over. You're specializing.

## Best civilian career paths for Navy AO

Let's get specific. Here's where AOs consistently land jobs, with real salary data and what certifications you need.

### Defense Contractor - Aviation Ordnance Technician (best pay, direct translation)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Aviation Ordnance Systems Technician
- Weapons Systems Technician
- Aircraft Armament Technician
- Aviation Ordnance Specialist
- Munitions Systems Technician

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level ordnance tech (contractor):** $55,000-$70,000
- **Experienced technician (3-5 years):** $70,000-$90,000
- **Senior ordnance specialist:** $85,000-$110,000
- **Ordnance subject matter expert:** $95,000-$130,000
- **Program lead / technical advisor:** $110,000-$145,000

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing your AO job for a defense contractor.
- Loading and unloading aviation munitions
- Weapons systems maintenance and troubleshooting
- Ordnance inspection and serviceability checks
- Technical manual compliance
- Safety protocols and explosive handling procedures
- Aircraft-specific weapons configurations

**Certifications needed:**
- **Security clearance** (Secret minimum, TS/SCI preferred)—if you have active clearance, you're golden
- **Your Navy AO training documentation**—proof of ordnance school completion
- **Forklift / material handling equipment certification** (usually provided by employer)
- **Explosive safety training** (DOD/DDESB courses)—often employer-provided

**Reality check:**
This is the highest-paying direct path for AOs. Defense contractors supporting Navy, Air Force, and Marine aviation need qualified ordnance technicians at bases and on carriers.

Companies like Vertex Aerospace, M1 Support Services, AECOM, DynCorp, and L3Harris hire AOs constantly. Positions at NAS Lemoore, Oceana, Whidbey Island, Cherry Point, overseas locations (Japan, Bahrain, Diego Garcia).

Work is similar to active duty—flight line operations, shift work, working around aircraft. Difference? Way better pay, no deployments (though OCONUS contracts exist), and you go home at the end of your shift.

Active clearance is your golden ticket. If your clearance expired, getting hired is harder (employer has to sponsor you for reinvestigation, which is expensive and slow).

**Best for:** AOs who want to keep doing ordnance work for significantly better pay without the Navy bureaucracy.

### Ammunition Specialist / Munitions Handler (government civilian)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Ammunition Specialist (DoD civilian)
- Munitions Handler
- Ammunition Storage Specialist
- Ordnance Operations Specialist
- Explosive Ordnance Worker

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level ammunition specialist (GS-6/7):** $42,000-$52,000
- **Experienced specialist (GS-8/9):** $52,000-$68,000
- **Senior ammunition specialist (GS-11):** $68,000-$84,000
- **Supervisory roles (GS-12+):** $84,000-$105,000

**What translates directly:**
- Receiving, storing, and issuing ammunition
- Inventory management and accountability
- Ammunition surveillance and inspection
- Explosive safety compliance
- Operating material handling equipment
- Documentation and record keeping

**Certifications needed:**
- **DOD Ammunition Handler certification** (usually provided on the job)
- **Forklift certification**
- **Explosive safety training** (employer-provided)
- **Security clearance** (required for most positions)

**Reality check:**
Government civilian ammunition jobs are at Army, Navy, Air Force ammunition depots and storage facilities. Places like Naval Magazine Indian Island, Crane Army Ammunition Activity, McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, Sierra Army Depot.

Federal job = federal benefits. Pension, TSP match, health insurance, job security. Veteran preference gives you 5-10 points in the hiring process, which matters because these jobs are competitive.

Pay is lower than defense contractors, but stability is higher. You're not dependent on contract renewals. Downside: you're working in an ammo dump, not on a flight line. It's warehouse/logistics work with explosives, not aircraft work.

Hiring process is slow (6-12 months from application to start date). Use USAJOBS.gov and search for Ammunition Specialist (job series 6502).

**Best for:** AOs who want federal job security and benefits, don't mind less aircraft-focused work, and can handle the slow government hiring process.

### Explosives Worker / Blaster (commercial sector)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Blaster (mining, quarrying, construction)
- Explosive Technician
- Powder Crew Member
- Seismic Blaster (oil & gas)
- Demolition Specialist

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level blaster:** $40,000-$50,000
- **Experienced blaster (3-5 years):** $50,000-$65,000
- **Senior blaster / crew chief:** $65,000-$80,000
- **Blaster with specialized skills (underwater, tunnel):** $75,000-$95,000

**What translates directly:**
- Safe handling of explosive materials
- Understanding of blast procedures
- Following safety protocols and regulations
- Attention to detail (explosives don't forgive mistakes)
- Working in challenging environments
- Documentation and compliance

**Certifications needed:**
- **State Blaster's License** (varies by state)—requires written exam and practical demonstration. Cost: $500-1,500
- **ATF Employee Possessor Clearance** or **ATF Explosives License**—background check and approval to handle explosives. Cost: $200-3,000 depending on license type
- **MSHA training** (if working in mining)—Mine Safety and Health Administration certification
- **OSHA 10/30 hour safety certification**—$50-200

**Reality check:**
Blasting is hard physical work. You're drilling blast holes, loading explosives, detonating charges, and clearing debris. Construction sites, rock quarries, mining operations, road projects.

It's not aviation. It's not glamorous. But it pays decently, demand is steady, and your explosives background from the Navy is exactly what employers want.

Work is weather-dependent and project-based. You might work 60-hour weeks on a big project, then have downtime between jobs. Overtime is common.

Geographic location matters. Mining states (Nevada, Wyoming, Arizona, Alaska) and states with active construction (Texas, Colorado) have more opportunities.

**Best for:** AOs who want to use their explosives knowledge, don't mind physical outdoor work, and are willing to work in industries outside aviation.

### Quality Assurance Inspector - Ordnance / Ammunition

**Civilian job titles:**
- Ordnance Quality Assurance Specialist
- Ammunition Inspector
- Munitions QA Inspector
- Weapons Systems QC Technician
- Explosive Safety Specialist

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level QA inspector:** $50,000-$62,000
- **Experienced inspector (3-5 years):** $62,000-$78,000
- **Senior QA specialist:** $78,000-$95,000
- **QA Manager (ordnance/ammunition):** $90,000-$115,000

**What translates directly:**
- Inspecting ordnance for defects and serviceability
- Understanding technical specifications and tolerances
- Documentation and non-conformance reporting
- Regulatory compliance (DOD, DDESB, ATF standards)
- Attention to detail
- Safety protocols

**Certifications needed:**
- **ASQ Certified Quality Inspector (CQI)**—Cost: $438-638 + study materials
- **DDESB Explosives Safety courses**—Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board training
- **AS9100 or ISO 9001 training** (aerospace/defense quality standards)—$500-1,500
- **Security clearance** (for defense contractor QA roles)

**Reality check:**
QA inspection is less hands-on than loading bombs, more about checking that work was done correctly and documenting everything.

You're the person who signs off that ammunition is safe, ordnance meets specs, and weapons systems are airworthy. It's responsibility without the physical labor.

Ammunition manufacturers (General Dynamics Ordnance, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems), defense contractors, and government ammunition facilities need QA inspectors.

Work is typically day shift, climate-controlled, less physically demanding than line work. Good career progression into QA management or safety specialist roles.

**Best for:** AOs who are detail-oriented, prefer inspection over hands-on loading, and want career progression toward management.

### Law Enforcement - Bomb Squad / Explosive Ordnance Disposal Support

**Civilian job titles:**
- Bomb Technician (Police/Sheriff EOD)
- ATF Special Agent - Explosives Enforcement
- Explosive Detection K9 Handler
- Hazardous Devices Technician
- EOD Support Technician

**Salary ranges:**
- **Police Bomb Technician:** $65,000-$90,000 (including police officer base pay)
- **ATF Special Agent:** $52,000-$95,000 (GS-7 to GS-13)
- **FBI Special Agent (EOD background):** $72,000-$136,000
- **Senior Bomb Tech (large metro area):** $90,000-$115,000

**What translates directly:**
- Explosives knowledge and safety protocols
- Handling hazardous materials
- High-stress decision making
- Technical training and procedure compliance
- Understanding of ordnance and explosive devices

**Certifications needed:**
- **Police Officer certification (POST academy)**—required to be a cop first, then bomb squad. 4-6 months academy
- **FBI Hazardous Devices School**—federal bomb tech training, typically after you're hired by a department
- **ATF Special Agent application process**—federal law enforcement hiring (competitive)
- **Bachelor's degree** (preferred/required for federal agents)

**Reality check:**
You can't just apply to be a bomb tech. You need to be a police officer or federal agent first, then get selected for bomb squad training.

Path: Get hired by police/sheriff department → work patrol for 2-4 years → apply to bomb squad → attend FBI Hazardous Devices School → become bomb tech.

It's a long road, but your AO background gives you a massive advantage. Most cops have zero explosives experience. You've handled live ordnance for years.

Bomb squads are small units in large departments (NYPD, LAPD, Chicago PD) or regional teams serving multiple agencies. Jobs are competitive.

Federal agent route (ATF, FBI) is even more competitive but pays better and has national jurisdiction.

**Best for:** AOs who want a law enforcement career and can leverage their explosives expertise as a long-term specialization within LE.

### Industrial Maintenance Technician / Weapons Systems Mechanic

**Civilian job titles:**
- Industrial Maintenance Technician (aerospace)
- Weapons Systems Mechanic
- Electro-Mechanical Technician
- Hydraulic/Pneumatic Systems Technician

**Certifications needed:**
- **Industrial Maintenance Technician certification**—various providers (community colleges, trade schools). Cost: $2,000-5,000
- **Hydraulic/Pneumatic Technician certification**—Fluid Power Society. Cost: $500-1,000
- **Electrical certification** (helpful)—Cost: varies
- **OSHA 10/30 hour safety**—$50-200

**Reality check:**
This path pivots away from explosives/ordnance and focuses on the mechanical/electrical side of your AO experience. You maintained bomb racks, missile launchers, release systems—that's mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems.

Manufacturing facilities, aerospace companies, and industrial plants need maintenance techs who can troubleshoot complex machinery. Your military maintenance background translates.

Pay is solid, work is steady, and you're not dealing with explosives anymore (if you want a break from that). Downside: less specialized than ordnance work, so pay ceiling is lower.

**Best for:** AOs who enjoyed the maintenance side of the job more than the ordnance handling and want to pivot to general industrial maintenance.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "Aviation Ordnanceman" on civilian resumes. Translate your experience into civilian-friendly language:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |

Drop military acronyms. Don't write CAD, PAD, CAMS, or MAF. Write out "explosive cartridge actuated devices" or "maintenance action forms" or just rephrase entirely.

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill benefits:

### High priority (get these):

**State Blaster's License** - If you're pursuing commercial explosives work. Required by law to handle explosives in construction/mining. Cost: $500-1,500 depending on state. Time: 2-4 weeks (study, exam, practical test). Value: Opens entire commercial explosives industry.

**ATF Employee Possessor Clearance** - Required to handle explosives for an employer. Background check through Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Cost: $200 (employer usually pays). Time: 2-4 months for background check. Value: Required for most ammunition/explosives civilian jobs.

**Forklift / Material Handling Equipment Certification** - You probably operated equipment in the Navy, but civilian certification is quick and expected. Cost: $50-150. Time: 1 day. Value: Checkbox requirement for most ordnance jobs.

**OSHA 30-Hour Safety Certification** - General industry or construction safety. Shows you understand workplace safety regulations. Cost: $150-300. Time: 1 week online. Value: Expected by most employers in industrial/construction fields.

### Medium priority (if it fits your path):

**ASQ Certified Quality Inspector (CQI)** - If you're targeting QA/QC roles. Cost: $500-800. Time: 2-3 months study. Value: Industry-recognized quality credential.

**Associate's degree in Industrial Technology or related field** - Opens doors to supervisor/management roles. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 2 years. Value: Helps with career progression and federal job qualifications.

**Hydraulic/Pneumatic Technician Certification** - Fluid Power Society cert for systems maintenance. Cost: $500-1,000. Time: 3-6 months. Value: Useful if pivoting to industrial maintenance.

**POST Academy (Police Officer certification)** - If you're targeting law enforcement with long-term bomb squad goal. Cost: $0 (paid academy) but requires full-time commitment. Time: 4-6 months. Value: Required first step for bomb technician path.

### Low priority (specialized, not critical):

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - For moving into project management roles in defense contracting. Cost: $500-3,000. Value: Career advancement, not entry-level requirement.

**Welding certification** - If you enjoyed fabrication work and want skilled trade option. Cost: $500-2,000. Time: 2-6 months part-time.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest. Here's what you'll need to adjust:

**Civilian safety culture vs. military safety culture:** Both are serious about safety, but civilians are way more paperwork-focused. Expect more safety meetings, more documentation, more "cover your ass" protocols. It's not better or worse, just different.

**Customer service communication:** In the Navy, you loaded weapons and the aircrew flew the mission. Done. Civilian contractor work means interfacing with clients (active duty maintainers, government reps). You'll need professional communication skills, not just technical competence.

**Resume and interview skills:** You need to translate your experience. Practice explaining what you did without military jargon. "I assembled and loaded precision-guided munitions on F/A-18 aircraft following technical procedures" not "I was an AO on Hornets."

**Commercial driver's license (CDL):** Some ammunition and explosives transport jobs require CDL. If you want maximum flexibility, consider getting your CDL. Cost: $3,000-7,000 for training. Opens trucking, heavy equipment, and explosives transport roles.

**Regional differences:** Explosives jobs exist where extraction industries (mining, oil/gas) or major construction happens. If you live in a state with limited industry, you might need to relocate. Research job markets before you commit to a location.

## Real AO success stories

**Jason, 28, former AO (E-5) → Aviation Ordnance Technician at Vertex Aerospace**

After 5 years loading missiles on EA-18Gs at Whidbey Island, Jason got out and applied to Vertex Aerospace contractor positions. His active Secret clearance was the key. Started at $68,000 supporting F/A-18s at NAS Lemoore. Now makes $84,000 after 3 years, doing the exact same work he did in the Navy but going home every night. No duty, no deployments, way better pay.

**Maria, 26, former AO → Ammunition Specialist (GS-9) at Naval Magazine Indian Island**

Maria did 4 years as an AO, got out and applied to federal ammunition specialist positions using veteran preference. Hired at GS-7 ($48,000), promoted to GS-9 within 2 years ($62,000). Work is less exciting than flight line ops—mostly warehouse inventory and storage management—but the federal benefits are solid and work-life balance is excellent. She's using TA to finish her bachelor's degree part-time.

**Derek, 33, former AO → Blaster for mining company in Nevada**

Derek did 8 years, made E-6, got out and wanted nothing to do with military aviation anymore. Got his Nevada blaster's license, hired by a gold mining operation. Started at $52,000, now makes $71,000 after 4 years as a crew chief. Hard physical work, long days during active projects, but he loves working outdoors and the overtime pay is substantial. Completely different from the Navy but his explosives background made him immediately valuable.

## Action plan: your first 90 days out

Here's what to actually do when you transition:

### Month 1: Documentation and assessment
- Get your DD-214, keep 10 copies, upload digital version
- Request training records (proof of AO school completion)
- Document security clearance status and expiration date (critical)
- Apply for VA benefits if eligible
- Set up LinkedIn profile highlighting ordnance and explosives experience
- Research defense contractors hiring ordnance techs (Vertex, M1 Support, AECOM, L3Harris)
- Decide: stay in ordnance (defense contractors) OR pivot to commercial explosives OR change fields entirely

### Month 2: Certifications and applications
- Get forklift certification (quick, cheap, required for most ordnance jobs)
- Apply for ATF Employee Possessor Clearance (if targeting commercial explosives work)
- Update resume using skills translation table above
- Apply to 10+ positions per week on ClearanceJobs.com, USAJOBS.gov, defense contractor sites
- Network with other AOs who transitioned (LinkedIn, veteran groups)
- Attend veteran hiring events (especially defense contractors and federal agencies)
- Get OSHA 10 or 30-hour safety certification (online, 1 week)

### Month 3: Interviews and advanced planning
- Tailor resume for each application (highlight ordnance or explosives or maintenance depending on job)
- Practice interview answers about explosives safety, weapons systems, technical procedures
- Follow up on applications (phone calls, LinkedIn messages to recruiters)
- If defense contractor interviews, emphasize clearance status and willingness to relocate
- Consider temporary/contract work if direct hire hasn't happened (gets your foot in door)
- Start GI Bill paperwork if pursuing degree or advanced certifications

## Bottom line for Navy AO

Your ordnance and explosives experience is specialized, regulated, and valuable.

You've proven you can handle dangerous materials safely, follow complex technical procedures, and manage accountability for millions of dollars in weapons and ammunition. Defense contractors, government agencies, and commercial industries need that expertise.

First-year civilian income of $46K-67K is realistic for entry roles. With active security clearance and experience, defense contractor ordnance technicians make $70K-110K. Federal ammunition specialists reach GS-11/12 ($68K-105K). Commercial blasters and specialized explosive technicians make $50K-95K depending on industry and location.

Your fastest paths:
1. **Keep your clearance active, apply to defense contractors** for aviation ordnance technician roles (highest pay, direct translation)
2. **Get blaster's license, work commercial explosives** in mining/construction (pivot to new industry, decent pay)
3. **Apply to federal ammunition jobs on USAJOBS** using veteran preference (job security, benefits)

All three paths work. Pick based on what you want: highest pay (defense contractor), stability (federal), or complete change of scenery (commercial explosives).

Don't let anyone tell you ordnance experience doesn't translate. There are fewer people qualified to handle explosives than jobs available. You're in demand. Act like it.
