## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 11X Infantry soldiers transitioning out—whether you reclassed to 11B (Rifleman) or 11C (Indirect Fire)—your **combat arms training, tactical proficiency, weapons expertise, leadership under pressure, physical resilience, mission execution experience, and proven performance in high-stress environments** make you competitive across law enforcement, private security, emergency services, skilled trades, and defense contracting. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$75,000** in law enforcement, security, or trades, scaling to **$90,000-$150,000** in federal law enforcement, emergency management, or specialized security roles. Top performers in private contracting, executive protection, or technical leadership can earn **$120,000-$250,000+**.

You enlisted as 11X and got assigned either 11B or 11C after infantry training. Regardless of which path you took, you developed the same core infantry skills: tactical operations, weapons proficiency, small unit leadership, physical fitness, mission planning, crisis management, and the ability to execute under fire. The civilian world values those foundational skills across multiple industries—you just need to target roles where your infantry background translates directly to operational capability.

Most 11X infantry veterans transition to law enforcement (local, state, federal), private security (corporate, contracting, executive protection), emergency services (fire, EMS, emergency management), skilled trades (construction, transportation, manufacturing), or defense contracting (training, operations). Your transition timeline is 6-12 months with strategic planning. Start 9-12 months before ETS.

## What Does an Army 11X Infantry Soldier Do?

When you enlisted as 11X Infantry Enlistment Option, you completed Infantry One Station Unit Training (OSUT) at Fort Moore, Georgia. After basic combat training and infantry-specific training, you were assigned either MOS 11B (Infantryman/Rifleman) or MOS 11C (Indirect Fire Infantryman) based on Army needs and your performance.

**If you became 11B:** You operated as a rifleman, executed tactical missions, conducted patrols, engaged enemy forces, cleared buildings, provided security, operated crew-served weapons (M240, M249), and led or supported fire teams. You mastered individual tactical skills, close quarters combat, mounted/dismounted operations, land navigation, and weapons systems.

**If you became 11C:** You operated mortars (60mm, 81mm, 120mm), calculated firing data, directed mortar crews, executed indirect fire missions, maintained fire control systems, coordinated with maneuver forces, and ensured precision delivery of indirect fires. You mastered ballistics calculations, crew leadership, technical weapons operation, and mission coordination.

**Regardless of 11B or 11C:** You developed tactical proficiency, physical endurance, mental toughness, teamwork, leadership, accountability, adaptability, and the ability to execute complex missions under extreme pressure. Those core infantry competencies translate directly to civilian careers requiring discipline, crisis management, and operational excellence.
