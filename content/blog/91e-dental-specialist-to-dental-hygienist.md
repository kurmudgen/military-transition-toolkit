# 91E Dental Specialist to Dental Hygienist: Your Complete Transition Guide

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Army 91E Dental Specialists have significant advantages transitioning to civilian Dental Hygienist positions. With your military training in oral health procedures, patient care, and infection control, you're positioned for a smooth career transition. Dental Hygienists earn a median salary of $77,090 annually (BLS), with strong job growth of 7% through 2032. Becoming a Licensed Dental Hygienist (LDH) requires passing the DANB exam and state licensing, but your military background streamlines this process considerably.

## Career Overview: From Military Dentistry to Civilian Practice

As a 91E Dental Specialist, you've developed clinical expertise that directly transfers to dental hygienist work. Your military experience includes:

- Clinical dental procedures and patient care
- Radiographic techniques and digital imaging
- Infection control and sterilization protocols
- Patient education and health promotion
- Preventive dentistry procedures
- Electronic health records and dental documentation

The civilian Dental Hygienist role builds on these skills while expanding into independent practice responsibilities and entrepreneurial opportunities that don't exist in military settings.

### Current Scope of Practice

Military 91E Specialists typically work under dentist supervision in military treatment facilities, performing preventive care, scaling, and patient education. Civilian Dental Hygienists work in private practices, public health clinics, hospitals, and increasingly in expanded duties states that allow greater autonomy. Some states now permit Dental Hygienists to perform restorative procedures, apply sealants independently, and initiate local anesthesia.
