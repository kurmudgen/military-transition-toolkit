# Best Cities in South Dakota for Veterans 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Sioux Falls takes the #1 spot for South Dakota's best city for veterans, offering the strongest job market (unemployment under 2%), excellent healthcare (Sanford and Avera systems plus Sioux Falls VAMC), and a cost of living 9% below the national average. With a median home price of $335,000 and rent around $1,130/month, it's affordable for a metro of 200,000+ people—and growing rapidly with new veteran-friendly employers.

For military-connected veterans, **Rapid City (Box Elder area)** ranks #2 thanks to proximity to Ellsworth Air Force Base, a 3,800+ military retiree community, and stunning Black Hills scenery. Cost of living is 11% below the national average, with median homes around $285,000.

For budget-conscious veterans, **Aberdeen** offers the best value: median home prices of $209,000 (21% below national average), a VA clinic in town, and a tight-knit veteran community. **Brookings** is ideal for veterans attending college (SDSU) or seeking small-city charm with low costs.

Overall, South Dakota delivers exceptional value for veterans: even the "expensive" cities (Sioux Falls, Rapid City) cost less than most U.S. metros, the state has **zero income tax** (keeping 100% of military retirement pay), and the 1.8% unemployment rate (nation's lowest) means jobs are plentiful. No matter where you land in South Dakota, you'll find affordable living, friendly communities, and a veteran-welcoming culture.

- Monthly mortgage: $1,320
- Property tax (monthly, 1.25% rate): $218
- **If 100% disabled:** Save $208/month = $2,500/year
- Insurance: $100/month
- Total monthly: $1,638 (or $1,430 if 100% disabled)
- **20-year cost:** $393,120 (or $343,200 if 100% disabled)

**Key takeaway:** If you're 100% disabled, the $200,000 property tax exemption saves $2,500-$3,100/year depending on city. Over 20 years, that's $50,000-$62,000 in savings. This makes higher-cost cities like Sioux Falls much more affordable for disabled veterans.

### Renting vs Buying Analysis

**Break-even point in Sioux Falls:**
- Rent: $1,130/month = $13,560/year
- Own (with mortgage): $32,172/year total costs
- Own (100% disabled, partial property tax exemption): $29,088/year

Renting is cheaper short-term. If you're 100% disabled and plan to stay 10+ years, buying builds equity and the property tax exemption helps offset costs.

**Break-even in Aberdeen:**
- Rent: $875/month = $10,500/year
- Own: $19,656/year
- Own (100% disabled): $17,160/year

With lower costs, buying in Aberdeen makes sense if you plan to stay 5+ years, especially if you're 100% disabled.

## Climate & Weather

### Best Weather
1. **Rapid City/Spearfish**: Drier climate (Black Hills), 300+ sunny days/year, less humid than eastern SD
2. **Sioux Falls/Brookings**: Four seasons, but more humid and windier

### Harshest Weather
All South Dakota cities have cold winters (below freezing November-March) and hot summers (80-95°F). Western SD (Rapid City) is drier and sunnier; eastern SD (Sioux Falls, Aberdeen) is more humid with more precipitation.

**What to expect:**
- Winter: 10-25°F, snow, wind, occasional blizzards (eastern SD windier)
- Spring: Tornado season (April-June), severe thunderstorms
- Summer: 80-95°F, humid (eastern SD), dry (western SD)
- Fall: Beautiful, mild (best season)

If you hate cold and snow, South Dakota isn't for you. If you can handle seasons, western SD (Rapid City) offers more sunshine and less humidity.

## Crime & Safety

**Safest Cities:**
1. **Spearfish**: Very low crime
2. **Brookings**: College town safety
3. **Watertown**: Small-city low crime
4. **Aberdeen**: Safe community

**Higher Crime Areas:**
- **Rapid City**: 742 violent crimes per 100,000 (double state average of 350), though improving—violence lowest since 2020
- **Sioux Falls**: 5.65 violent crimes per 1,000 (565 per 100,000)—down 13% in 2024, lowest since 2019

**Reality check:** Even Sioux Falls and Rapid City are safer than most U.S. cities their size. South Dakota overall is a safe state. Crime tends to be property crime (theft) rather than violent crime.

## Lifestyle Factors

### Outdoor Recreation
**Best cities for:**
- **Hunting/Fishing:** Aberdeen (pheasant capital), Watertown (lakes), Yankton (Missouri River), anywhere in SD (hunting/fishing culture)
- **Hiking/Biking:** Rapid City/Spearfish (Black Hills trails), Sioux Falls (70+ miles bike trails)
- **Mountain sports:** Rapid City/Spearfish (skiing, rock climbing)
- **Water sports:** Watertown (Lake Kampeska), Yankton (Lewis & Clark Lake), Pierre (Missouri River)

### Nightlife & Dining
**Best scenes:**
1. **Sioux Falls**: Downtown, Phillips Avenue—breweries, restaurants, live music
2. **Rapid City**: Main Street Square, downtown—bars, restaurants, Black Hills culture

Smaller cities have limited nightlife (VFW, local bars, chain restaurants).

### Arts & Culture
1. **Sioux Falls**: Washington Pavilion (science center, performing arts), SculptureWalk, Levitt at the Falls
2. **Rapid City**: Journey Museum, Dahl Arts Center, proximity to Mount Rushmore/Crazy Horse Memorial

## What to Avoid

**Cities to Skip (or approach with caution):**

**Far western/northern SD without VA access:** Towns in Harding, Perkins, Corson, or Dewey counties are 3+ hours from VA care. If you need regular healthcare, this is isolating and impractical.

**Why:** Limited healthcare access, no veteran community, few job opportunities.

**Better alternatives:** If you want rural SD, choose Aberdeen, Watertown, or Spearfish—small enough for that feel, big enough for services and VA clinics.
