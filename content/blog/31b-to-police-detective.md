## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 31B Military Police have **the most direct pathway to law enforcement and detective careers earning $65,000-$120,000+ annually**. Your experience with law enforcement operations, investigations, security operations, and use of force translates directly to civilian police, criminal investigation, federal law enforcement, and security management roles. Entry-level police officers start at **$50,000-$70,000**, detectives earn **$70,000-$95,000**, federal agents make **$80,000-$120,000**, and senior investigators command **$95,000-$135,000+**. **Veteran preference gives you 5-10 point hiring advantages** in civil service exams. Most agencies require only a high school diploma (bachelor's increases advancement speed), plus successful completion of police academy (provided by agency after hiring). Law enforcement agencies nationwide actively recruit military police for your training, discipline, and operational experience.

## Why 31B Military Police Excel as Detectives

Every military police officer researching civilian careers hears: "Civilian police is different." "Military MP experience doesn't count." "You'll start from scratch."

Here's what law enforcement agencies actually know: **31B Military Police are among the most sought-after candidates for detective positions.**

You didn't just "write tickets and guard gates." You:
- Conducted criminal investigations and evidence collection
- Performed patrol operations and incident response
- Executed apprehensions and law enforcement operations
- Wrote detailed reports and maintained evidence chain of custody
- Testified in military court proceedings
- Responded to domestic disturbances and violent incidents
- Conducted interviews and interrogations
- Worked with sensitive and classified investigations
- Applied use of force continuum and de-escalation techniques
- Coordinated with other agencies (CID, OSI, NCIS, local police)
- Maintained security operations for high-value assets
- Led teams in law enforcement missions

That's not "basic security" - that's professional law enforcement with investigation experience. Civilian police departments want officers who can investigate crimes, write reports, testify in court, make sound judgments under pressure, and work professionally. You've been doing this.
