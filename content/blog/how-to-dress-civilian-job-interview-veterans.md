# How to Dress for Civilian Job Interview: Complete Guide for Veterans

## Bottom Line Up Front

What you wear to an interview affects whether you get hired. Most veterans either overdress in military-style formal wear or underdress in casual clothing, missing the mark for civilian professional standards. This guide shows you how to dress appropriately for different industries, interview types, and company cultures—ensuring your appearance supports (not undermines) your candidacy.

## Why Interview Appearance Matters

**The Research:**
- 93% of hiring managers consider appearance "important" or "very important"
- First impression made in 7-10 seconds
- Inappropriate dress reduces interview success by 30-40%
- Professional appearance increases confidence (your and theirs)

For veterans, appropriate dress is especially important because:
- You're unfamiliar to civilian employers
- Professional appearance signals "I understand civilian norms"
- Helps overcome military background concerns
- Shows respect for the interview process

## Understanding Civilian Dress Codes

### Industry Dress Code Levels

**Level 1: Business Formal** (Most Conservative)
- Industries: Law, finance, government, accounting, banking
- Attire: Full suit, dress shoes, conservative accessories
- Example industries: Law firms, investment banks, federal agencies

**Level 2: Business Professional** (Standard)
- Industries: Technology, consulting, corporate, healthcare, insurance
- Attire: Suit or blazer with dress pants/skirt, dress shoes
- Example industries: Tech companies, consulting firms, corporations

**Level 3: Business Casual** (Relaxed Professional)
- Industries: Creative, startup, tech, nonprofit, education
- Attire: Blazer with dress pants/skirt (suit optional), or dress pants with professional blouse
- Example industries: Startups, creative agencies, nonprofits

**Level 4: Casual** (Very Relaxed)
- Industries: Some tech, creative, very casual startups
- Attire: Nice jeans or dress pants, professional shirt/blouse
- Example industries: Casual tech startups, creative agencies

### How to Determine Dress Code Level

**Research Company Culture:**

1. **Visit Company Website**
   - Look at team photos (How are people dressed?)
   - Check about/culture pages
   - Review social media (LinkedIn, Instagram)

2. **Call Recruiting/HR**
   - "What's appropriate to wear to the interview?"
   - Most will tell you directly
   - Shows you're thoughtful about professionalism

3. **Check Glassdoor**
   - Employee reviews often mention dress code
   - Search "[Company name] dress code"

4. **Check LinkedIn**
   - Look at employee profiles
   - See what they're wearing in photos

5. **When in Doubt**
   - Default to Business Professional (one level up)
   - Better overdressed than underdressed
   - Can always remove blazer if needed
