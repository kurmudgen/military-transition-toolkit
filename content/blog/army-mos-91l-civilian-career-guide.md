## What Does an Army 91L Do?

As a Construction Equipment Repairer, you supervised and performed field and sustainment maintenance on the Army's fleet of engineer equipment—everything from bulldozers, excavators, scrapers, graders, wheel loaders, backhoes, dump trucks, forklifts, cranes, and asphalt pavers to rock crushers, concrete mixers, and specialized earthmoving equipment. You weren't working on light vehicles—you maintained **Caterpillar D7 dozers, John Deere excavators, Case backhoes, JLG telehandlers, Grove cranes**, and other heavy iron critical to engineering missions.

Your work included diagnosing hydraulic system failures (pumps, valves, cylinders, hoses), rebuilding diesel engines and transmissions, troubleshooting electrical and electronic control systems, repairing final drives and differentials, welding structural repairs, replacing undercarriage components (tracks, rollers, idlers), performing preventive maintenance, and conducting battlefield damage assessment and repair (BDAR). You used diagnostic software, hydraulic test equipment, multimeters, welders, and torque wrenches to keep equipment operational.

You worked in motor pools, forward operating bases, and field environments—often with limited parts, improvising solutions, and repairing equipment under time pressure to keep engineering missions on schedule. When a dozer broke down clearing a route or an excavator failed during a construction project, commanders called you. That's troubleshooting under pressure with mission consequences.

Dealers, rental companies, and contractors often hire based on direct contact and referrals, not just online applications.

## Interview Preparation (Common Questions)

**Q: Tell me about your heavy equipment experience.**
A: "As an Army 91L Construction Equipment Repairer, I maintained Caterpillar bulldozers, John Deere excavators, Case backhoes, wheel loaders, graders, and other engineer equipment. I diagnosed hydraulic failures, rebuilt diesel engines, repaired electrical systems, and performed preventive maintenance. I also conducted field repairs in deployed environments where equipment downtime wasn't an option. I have hands-on experience with hydraulic troubleshooting, diesel diagnostics, and welding repairs."

**Q: Describe a complex repair you completed.**
A: [Use STAR method] "During a field operation, a D7 dozer lost hydraulic pressure and couldn't operate its blade—critical for route clearing. I systematically tested the hydraulic system, identified a failed main control valve, and replaced it using available parts. I purged air from the system, tested all functions, and restored the dozer to full operation within 6 hours. This required reading hydraulic schematics, using pressure gauges, and working independently under mission pressure."

**Q: What ASE certifications do you have?**
A: "I've earned ASE T2 (Diesel Engines) and T6 (Electrical Systems) certifications, and I'm studying for T3 (Drivetrain) and T4 (Brakes). I plan to earn Master Technician status within 2 years."

**Q: Are you comfortable with field service work and travel?**
A: "Yes. I performed field repairs during Army deployments with limited tools and parts. I'm accustomed to troubleshooting independently, working in all weather conditions, and being on-call. I understand field service requires travel and flexibility, and I'm prepared for that."

**Q: What's your experience with hydraulic systems?**
A: "Hydraulics were a core part of my 91L training and daily work. I diagnosed hydraulic failures using pressure gauges and flow meters, replaced pumps and control valves, repaired cylinders and hoses, and understood hydraulic schematics. I've worked on Caterpillar, John Deere, and Case hydraulic systems. I'm comfortable troubleshooting hydraulic issues independently."

**Q: Do you have welding experience?**
A: "Yes, I'm trained in stick (SMAW) and MIG (GMAW) welding. I performed structural repairs on equipment frames, fabricated mounting brackets, and conducted field welding repairs. I understand welding safety and proper joint preparation."

**Q: Why should we hire you?**
A: "I bring proven hands-on experience with heavy equipment, strong troubleshooting skills, and a military work ethic. I've maintained million-dollar equipment where failure impacted missions and soldier safety. I'm ASE-certified, safety-conscious, and committed to minimizing downtime. I'm looking for a long-term career with a company that values quality work and invests in technician development."

**Q: What are your salary expectations?**
A: [Research first] "Based on my research and experience, entry-level heavy equipment mechanics in this area earn $50K-$60K. Given my 91L background, ASE certifications, and hands-on experience with Caterpillar and John Deere equipment, I'm targeting $55K-$60K, but I'm flexible based on training opportunities and benefits."

**Q: Do you have any questions for us?**
A: (Always ask)
- "What brands of equipment does your shop primarily service?"
- "What manufacturer training opportunities do you offer technicians?"
- "What does a typical day look like for this position?"
- "How do you support career advancement and technician development?"
- "What's the on-call rotation or field service travel percentage?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Waiting to apply until you have all certifications.**
Your 91L experience is valuable NOW. Apply immediately while studying for ASE tests. Employers will hire based on your military experience and train you. Don't wait 6 months to get certified first.

**Mistake 2: Only applying to dealerships and ignoring rental companies, construction firms, and mining.**
Dealers are competitive. Rental companies (United Rentals, Sunbelt) hire quickly, offer good pay, and provide training. Construction companies and mining operations often pay more. Cast a wide net.

**Mistake 3: Using military jargon on resumes.**
Don't write "BDAR," "PMCSed engineer equipment," or "motor pool." Say "emergency field repairs," "performed preventive maintenance," and "equipment repair facility." Translate everything to civilian language.

**Mistake 4: Not researching manufacturer dealerships in your area.**
Find every Caterpillar, John Deere, Komatsu, Case, and Volvo dealer within 50 miles. Visit in person, ask about hiring, leave a resume. Many dealers hire based on walk-ins and referrals.

**Mistake 5: Overlooking mining opportunities due to location concerns.**
Mining pays $75K-$110K+ with rotation schedules (14 on/14 off, 21 on/7 off). You work half the year and earn more than full-time shop positions. Don't dismiss it without researching.

**Mistake 6: Expecting military pay equivalency immediately.**
Army E-5 with 6 years makes $40K-$50K base (plus benefits). Civilian entry-level pays $50K-$60K with similar benefits initially. You'll advance quickly—within 3 years you'll exceed military pay.

**Mistake 7: Not getting CDL if targeting field service.**
Field service techs need CDL (Class A or B) to drive service trucks and equipment trailers. It adds $10K-$15K annually. Many employers provide CDL training—ask about it.

## Success Stories: Real 91L Transitions

**Jason, 26, former 91L (E-4) → Caterpillar Dealer Field Service Tech → Senior Tech**

Jason served 4 years and got out as a Specialist. He applied to a Caterpillar dealer emphasizing his experience with CAT dozers and excavators.
