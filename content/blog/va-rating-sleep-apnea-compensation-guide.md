# VA Rating for Sleep Apnea: Complete Compensation Guide

Sleep apnea affects an estimated 30-40% of post-9/11 veterans, making it one of the fastest-growing service-connected disability claims. Unlike tinnitus with its fixed 10% rating, sleep apnea can earn anywhere from 10% to 100% depending on severity. If you snore loudly, experience daytime fatigue, or have been diagnosed with sleep apnea during or after military service, you likely qualify for VA disability compensation.

## Understanding Sleep Apnea and Military Service Connection

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. Each pause can last from seconds to minutes, and some individuals experience 30-100 breathing interruptions per hour. These interruptions prevent restful sleep, depriving the brain and body of oxygen.

### Types of Sleep Apnea

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)** - Accounts for 90% of cases. The airway physically collapses during sleep despite the brain's breathing effort.

**Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)** - The brain fails to send proper breathing signals to respiratory muscles.

**Complex Sleep Apnea** - Combination of both obstructive and central patterns.

Most service-connected sleep apnea is obstructive type. Veterans develop OSA from:
- Obesity (common in post-service life)
- Deviated septum from combat injuries
- Enlarged tonsils
- Excess neck tissue
- Allergies and nasal congestion
- Sleeping position and muscle tone changes

The VA connects sleep apnea to military service through several pathways:
1. Direct diagnosis during active duty
2. Documented sleep problems noted in military medical records
3. Service-connected conditions causing sleep apnea (TBI, PTSD, obesity from service)
4. Secondary to other rated conditions (back pain, anxiety limiting sleep position)

## VA Rating Percentages for Sleep Apnea

The VA uses Diagnostic Code 6847 for sleep apnea with a five-tier rating system based on severity:

**0% (Not Rated)** - Sleep apnea not recognized as service-connected or mild cases not meeting rating criteria

**10% Rating** - Mild sleep apnea with minimal daytime symptoms. Typically:
- Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) under 5 events per hour
- Minimal oxygen desaturation
- Mild snoring, infrequent pauses
- Little impact on daily function

**30% Rating** - Moderate sleep apnea with significant symptoms:
- AHI of 5-14.9 events per hour
- Some daytime somnolence or fatigue
- Regular snoring with noted pauses
- Sleep disruption affecting quality of life

**50% Rating** - Moderately severe sleep apnea:
- AHI of 15-29.9 events per hour
- Significant daytime somnolence
- Frequent oxygen desaturation (below 80%)
- Noticeable impact on daily activities and work

**100% Rating (TDIU)** - Severe sleep apnea with extreme impact:
- AHI over 30 events per hour
- Severe daytime somnolence affecting employment
- Significant oxygen desaturation episodes
- Medical documentation of severe functional limitation
- Often supported by additional service-connected conditions

### Understanding AHI Scores

The Apnea-Hypopnea Index measures breathing disruptions per hour of sleep. The higher the AHI, the more severe the sleep apnea and typically the higher the VA rating:

- AHI < 5: Generally mild (10% or non-rated)
- AHI 5-15: Usually moderate (30%)
- AHI 15-30: Often moderately severe (50%)
- AHI > 30: Typically severe (50-100%)

Your sleep study (polysomnography report) will show your specific AHI score.

## Monthly Compensation Amounts for Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea compensation varies by rating percentage and dependent status. As of 2025:

**10% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $175-$185/month
- With spouse: $195-$210/month
- With child: $210-$230/month

**30% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $330-$350/month
- With spouse: $365-$390/month
- With child: $395-$425/month

**50% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $605-$625/month
- With spouse: $665-$690/month
- With child: $720-$755/month

**100% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $3,737-$3,850/month
- With spouse: $4,095-$4,230/month
- With child: $4,450-$4,600/month

These amounts increase annually with Cost of Living Adjustment. Your effective date (usually your diagnosis or discharge date) determines your rate, with back pay calculated from that point.

### Combined Ratings Impact

Sleep apnea combines with other disabilities using the VA formula. For example:
- 10% sleep apnea + 10% hearing loss = 19% combined
- 30% sleep apnea + 20% back pain = 44% combined
- 50% sleep apnea + 30% PTSD = 65% combined

If you have multiple conditions, your sleep apnea rating may result in a higher combined rating than the individual percentages suggest.

## Evidence Requirements for Sleep Apnea Claims

### Medical Documentation

**Sleep Study Report (Polysomnography)**
- Most crucial evidence piece
- Shows AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) score
- Oxygen saturation levels during sleep
- Must be performed in a sleep lab or with home sleep apnea test
- Should be dated and contain physician interpretation

**Physician Diagnosis**
- Letter from sleep medicine specialist confirming sleep apnea diagnosis
- Date diagnosis established
- Recommended treatment (CPAP, oral appliance, surgery)
- Clinical opinion on severity

**Treatment Records**
- CPAP machine compliance data if applicable
- Oral appliance fitting records
- Surgical records if procedures performed
- Follow-up sleep study results

**Baseline Medical Records**
- Military service medical records mentioning sleep problems
- Previous sleep studies from service
- Waist circumference measurements (obesity is contributing factor)
- Blood pressure readings showing hypertension (common with sleep apnea)

### Lay Evidence

Written statements describing:
- When you first noticed sleep problems
- Frequency of snoring or breathing interruptions
- Daytime fatigue and functional limitations
- Impact on work performance
- Relationship between military service and condition onset
- Witness statements from family or service members

## Nexus Letter Guidance for Sleep Apnea

A nexus letter from a sleep medicine physician or primary care doctor is critical for most sleep apnea claims, establishing the connection between military service and current condition.

### Essential Nexus Letter Components

**1. Medical Opinion on Service Connection**
The nexus must state that sleep apnea is "at least as likely as not" caused by or significantly aggravated by military service.

**2. Specific Service-Related Cause**
Examples include:
- PTSD causing sleep disruption leading to OSA development
- TBI affecting airway control
- Obesity from military physical stress and post-service lifestyle
- Combat stress causing sleep problems aggravating pre-existing sleep apnea

**3. Review of Medical Evidence**
Reference your sleep study findings and diagnostic criteria supporting service connection.

**4. Timeline**
Explain when sleep problems started relative to military service or when current condition developed.

### Quality Nexus Letter Providers

- **VA Sleep Medicine Specialists**: Free through VA; request explicitly
- **Private Sleep Medicine Doctors**: Board-certified sleep specialists with access to military occupational knowledge
- **Veterans-Focused Providers**: Telehealth companies specializing in VA claims ($400-$800)
- **VA Service Organizations**: VSOs can connect you with approved providers

The strongest nexus letters come from providers familiar with military PTSD and other service-connected conditions commonly causing sleep disruption.

## C&P Exam Process for Sleep Apnea

The VA frequently schedules C&P exams for sleep apnea claims to assess severity and functional impact.

### What to Expect

**Exam Duration**: 30-60 minutes with a VA or contracted physician or physician assistant

**Examination Components**:
1. Medical history review focusing on sleep problems
2. Description of daytime symptoms and functional impact
3. Physical examination (weight, blood pressure, airway assessment)
4. Discussion of current treatments and compliance
5. Mental status evaluation to assess alertness and cognition
6. Work capacity assessment

### Key Questions You'll Be Asked

- When did sleep problems start?
- How many hours do you sleep nightly?
- Do you snore or experience pauses in breathing (per spouse/family)?
- Do you wake gasping for air?
- How fatigued are you during the day?
- What tasks does fatigue prevent you from performing?
- Are you using CPAP or other treatment? Compliance level?
- Has sleep apnea affected your job performance?
- Have you had a formal sleep study?

### Preparation Tips

- **Bring Sleep Study**: Provide actual polysomnography report showing AHI score
- **Document Daytime Impact**: Prepare specific examples of fatigue affecting work or daily activities
- **Note Treatment Attempts**: Discuss CPAP use, side effects, and compliance
- **Mention Witnesses**: Reference family members observing breathing pauses
- **Be Detailed on Impact**: "Extremely fatigued" is better than "tired." Specify: Can't concentrate at work, nearly fell asleep while driving, missed social events due to exhaustion.

The examiner will review your sleep study results and assess your current functional status. They're evaluating both the objective findings (AHI score) and subjective symptoms (daytime impact).

## Real Claim Examples

### Case 1: Combat PTSD with Secondary Sleep Apnea

A former Army infantryman (Sergeant E-5) with PTSD (70% rating) filed for sleep apnea. His combat-related hypervigilance prevented sleep; he developed severe sleep apnea from sleep deprivation consequences. He provided:
- Sleep study showing AHI of 42 (severe)
- Nexus letter from VA psychiatrist connecting PTSD-induced sleep disruption to sleep apnea
- Sleep medicine specialist report

**Outcome**: 50% sleep apnea rating. Combined with 70% PTSD = 85% overall. Monthly compensation increased from $2,100 to $2,894. Back pay: $8,400.

### Case 2: TBI-Related Sleep Apnea

A Navy pilot with documented TBI from aircraft accident filed sleep apnea claim with:
- Military brain injury documentation
- Sleep study (AHI 28)
- Neuropsychology report noting sleep regulation problems from TBI
- Private sleep medicine nexus letter

**Outcome**: 50% rating with effective date from TBI diagnosis. Monthly compensation: $625. Combined with 10% hearing loss = 55% overall.

### Case 3: Obesity Secondary to Service

A former Navy engineer with 20 years service filed for sleep apnea related to military-connected weight gain. He had:
- Sleep study showing AHI of 8 (mild-moderate)
- Military weigh-in records from service showing normal weight
- Current BMI of 33 (obese category)
- Physician statement that military occupational stress contributed to weight gain

**Outcome**: 30% rating. Combined with 20% back pain = 44% overall. Monthly compensation: $350.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Insufficient Sleep Study Documentation
Many claims fail because the sleep study is too old, incomplete, or lacks crucial AHI measurements.

**Solution**: Obtain a recent, comprehensive polysomnography report with clear AHI scoring.

### Mistake 2: No Clear Service Connection
Simply having sleep apnea isn't enough if you don't explain military service's role.

**Solution**: File nexus letter specifically addressing how military service caused or aggravated sleep apnea.

### Mistake 3: Downplaying Daytime Impact
Saying "I'm tired sometimes" won't justify 50% or 100% rating.

**Solution**: Document specific functional limitations: "Unable to work day shift," "Fall asleep while driving," "Can't perform job duties without sleep treatment."

### Mistake 4: Poor CPAP Compliance Documentation
If you have CPAP but don't use it, the VA questions severity.

**Solution**: Use CPAP consistently; request compliance reports from machine for exam.

### Mistake 5: Missing Secondary Conditions
Sleep apnea causes hypertension, heart problems, and worsens existing conditions.

**Solution**: File for secondary conditions (hypertension, atrial fibrillation) related to sleep apnea.

For denials with questionable reasoning, request board hearing. You can present new evidence and arguments before an appeals officer.

### Appeal Tips
- Identify specific reason for denial
- Provide better evidence addressing denial reason
- File quickly (one year from decision)
- Consider VSO or attorney assistance
- Document appeal timeline and submission dates

## Secondary Conditions Related to Sleep Apnea

Veterans with sleep apnea commonly develop secondary conditions warranting additional ratings:

**Hypertension (20-60% rating)** - Sleep apnea causes sustained high blood pressure

**Atrial Fibrillation (50-100% rating)** - Chronic oxygen deprivation triggers irregular heartbeat

**Pulmonary Hypertension (50-100% rating)** - Right heart stress from sleep apnea

**Cor Pulmonale (100% rating)** - Heart failure from untreated sleep apnea

**Depression/Anxiety (10-100% rating)** - Sleep deprivation effects on mental health

Filing secondary conditions dramatically increases total compensation through combined ratings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get 100% rating for sleep apnea without TDIU?**
A: Rarely. 100% is typically assigned through TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) when sleep apnea prevents work.

**Q: Does using CPAP affect my rating?**
A: Using CPAP shows you're treating the condition, which doesn't lower your rating—it demonstrates severity and compliance.

**Q: What AHI score guarantees 50% rating?**
A: AHI over 15 typically warrants 50%, but VA also considers daytime functional impact.

**Q: Should I file immediately after diagnosis?**
A: Yes. Your effective date starts when diagnosed or when service ends; delaying filing costs back pay.

**Q: Can I combine sleep apnea with PTSD ratings?**
A: Yes, if both are service-connected, they combine using VA formula.

## Conclusion

Sleep apnea represents one of the most winnable VA disability categories, particularly for post-9/11 veterans. With proper sleep study documentation and a clear nexus letter establishing military service connection, approval rates exceed 70%.

The key to maximum compensation is obtaining comprehensive sleep study evidence, securing a strong nexus letter, and clearly documenting daytime functional limitations. If you haven't filed yet, do so immediately to establish your effective date and begin receiving compensation.

Start your claim through VA.gov, your VA Regional Office, or with assistance from a veterans' service organization. With persistence and proper documentation, you can achieve the sleep apnea rating and compensation you've earned through military service.
