# Connecticut Military Retirement: Best Cities, Housing Costs & Quality of Life

Connecticut ranks among the best states for military retirees thanks to 100% exemption of military retirement pay, a new full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans, and excellent VA healthcare access. But Connecticut is also one of America's most expensive states, with the nation's 3rd highest property taxes and 8th highest overall cost of living.

So where should you actually live? Connecticut's cities vary dramatically in housing costs, veteran populations, employment opportunities, and property tax rates—ranging from Norwich's military-friendly submarine community to Stamford's expensive but high-earning finance corridor.

This guide ranks Connecticut's best cities for veterans with real data on home prices, veteran populations, and quality of life factors.

**Best for employment**: Stamford (highest salaries, defense contractors)

**Best for VA healthcare access**: West Haven, New Haven (adjacent to VAMC)
**Best college town**: Storrs/Mansfield (UConn, strong veteran programs)

**State average**: $415,300

**Critical factor**: Connecticut's property tax exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans (full exemption as of 2024) makes expensive towns more affordable for qualifying veterans.

## Cost of Living Deep Dive

### Property Taxes: The Connecticut Reality

Connecticut has the **3rd highest property taxes in America**. Here's what that means:

**Without exemptions**:
- Hartford: $13,028/year on $270K home
- Stamford: $8,610/year on $615K home
- Norwich: $4,725/year on $250K home

**With 100% P&T exemption**: $0 across the board

**The lesson**: The new 100% P&T property tax exemption (effective 2024) is TRANSFORMATIVE in Connecticut. It makes expensive towns with high mill rates suddenly affordable for disabled veterans.

### Housing Affordability Index

**Most affordable** (home price to income ratio):
1. Waterbury ($220K homes, $55K income)
2. New Britain ($200K homes, $50K income)
3. Norwich ($275K homes, $62K income with Electric Boat)

**Least affordable**:
1. Greenwich ($1.85M homes, need $300K+ income)
2. Stamford ($665K homes, need $110K+ income)
3. Darien/New Canaan ($900K+ homes, need $150K+ income)

### Where Veterans Can Actually Afford to Live

**On military retirement alone** (E-7 with 20 years = ~$45K/year):
- Waterbury: Manageable with 100% P&T exemption
- New Britain: Tight but possible
- Norwich: Requires second income or VA disability
- Hartford: Requires 100% P&T exemption + careful budgeting

**With Electric Boat job** ($70K-$95K):
- Norwich: Comfortable
- Hartford: Manageable
- Stamford: Still expensive

**With finance/insurance job** ($90K-$140K):
- Stamford: Manageable
- Hartford: Comfortable
- Norwich: Very comfortable

### Veterans Using GI Bill
**Best city**: Storrs/Mansfield (UConn)
**Why**: State tuition waiver + GI Bill = full coverage + housing allowance, strong veteran student support

### Veterans Seeking State Government Jobs

## Key Takeaways

1. **Norwich/Groton wins for most veterans** - Submarine community, Electric Boat jobs, affordable housing make it the clear choice

2. **100% P&T exemption is game-changing** - Turns Hartford's $13,000/year tax bill into $0, makes expensive towns suddenly viable

3. **Connecticut requires high income** - Unless you're 100% P&T disabled with full exemptions, you need $70K+ household income to live comfortably

4. **Small state advantage** - Nowhere in Connecticut is more than 90 minutes from VA medical center, excellent healthcare access statewide

5. **Job matters more than location** - Electric Boat job in Norwich ($75K) beats retail job in Stamford ($45K) even though Stamford is "nicer"

6. **Veteran community varies dramatically** - Norwich has strong submarine community, Stamford/Greenwich feel like regular affluent suburbs

7. **Apply for property tax exemption immediately** - If you're 100% P&T, file with your town assessor as soon as you establish residency—savings are enormous
