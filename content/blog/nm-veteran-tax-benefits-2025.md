# New Mexico Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

New Mexico offers solid tax benefits for veterans, with major improvements taking effect in 2025 and 2026. The standout benefit is a $10,000 annual property tax exemption for ALL veterans starting in 2025—regardless of disability rating. This exemption will be adjusted for inflation annually, making New Mexico one of the few states offering universal veteran property tax relief.

For 100% disabled veterans, New Mexico provides a full property tax exemption on your primary residence with no income cap or dollar limit, potentially saving $3,000-$6,000+ annually depending on where you live. Starting in 2026, veterans with disability ratings below 100% will receive proportional property tax exemptions—so if you're 70% disabled, you'll get a 70% property tax reduction on your home.

Military retirement pay receives a $30,000 annual income tax exemption (effective 2025), saving military retirees about $1,500-$1,800 per year. This exemption is now permanent and extends to surviving spouses. For higher-income retirees, there's pending legislation to eliminate the $30,000 cap entirely, which would make New Mexico fully tax-free for military retirement income.

The downside? New Mexico doesn't fully exempt military retirement pay like some neighboring states (Texas has no income tax at all). However, the combination of property tax relief for all veterans plus the $30,000 retirement exemption makes New Mexico competitive, especially if you're 100% disabled.

Overall, New Mexico ranks as highly tax-friendly for 100% disabled veterans and above-average for all other veterans. If you're planning to retire here, you'll save thousands annually—and those savings are only getting better with the 2026 proportional exemption expansion.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans (2025):**
- Exemption amount: 100% of assessed property value
- Cap: None—unlimited exemption
- Requirements: Must have 100% service-connected disability rating (permanent or temporary) from the VA
- Annual savings: $3,000-$6,000+ (based on county property tax rates and home values)

New Mexico's 100% disabled veteran property tax exemption is one of the most generous in the Southwest. If you're rated 100% by the VA, your primary residence is completely exempt from property taxes. There's no income limit, no cap on home value, and no requirement that your disability be permanent and total (P&T)—temporary 100% ratings qualify too.

Whether your house is worth $200,000 or $500,000, you pay zero property tax. This benefit alone can save you $3,000-$6,000 annually in Albuquerque or Santa Fe, and $2,000-$4,000 in smaller cities like Las Cruces or Farmington.

**All Veterans - $10,000 Exemption (Starting 2025):**
- Exemption amount: $10,000 reduction in assessed property value annually
- Eligibility: ALL honorably discharged veterans, regardless of disability rating
- Inflation adjustment: Yes—adjusted annually for inflation
- Annual savings: $300-$600 depending on county tax rates
- Requirements: Honorable discharge, New Mexico residency

Starting with the 2025 property tax year, New Mexico offers a $10,000 property tax exemption to ALL veterans. This is a universal benefit—you don't need a VA disability rating to qualify. As long as you served and received an honorable discharge, you're eligible.

This $10,000 exemption will be adjusted for inflation every year, ensuring the benefit keeps pace with rising property values. In practical terms, this saves you $300-$600 annually depending on your county's tax rate.

**Proportional Exemption for Disabled Veterans (Starting 2026):**
- Exemption amount: Proportional to your VA disability rating
- Eligibility: All disabled veterans and their surviving spouses
- Example: 70% disabled = 70% property tax reduction; 50% disabled = 50% reduction
- Effective date: Tax year 2026 and beyond

In November 2024, New Mexico voters approved Constitutional Amendment 1, which extends property tax exemptions to ALL disabled veterans in proportion to their federal disability rating. This is a game-changer for veterans rated below 100%.

If you're 80% disabled, you'll receive an 80% property tax exemption on your primary residence starting in 2026. A 50% rating gives you a 50% exemption. This proportional system makes New Mexico one of the most veteran-friendly property tax states in the nation.

**Example savings (based on $300,000 home in Albuquerque):**
- Annual property tax: ~$3,540 (1.18% effective rate)
- 70% disabled veteran savings (2026): $2,478/year
- 50% disabled veteran savings (2026): $1,770/year
- 30% disabled veteran savings (2026): $1,062/year

Plus, you still get the $10,000 universal veteran exemption on top of the proportional exemption.

### How to Apply

**For 100% Disabled Veteran Exemption:**

1. **Contact your county assessor's office** (Bernalillo, Santa Fe, Doña Ana, San Juan, or your county of residence)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - VA award letter showing 100% service-connected disability (P&T or temporary)
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
   - Proof of New Mexico residency
   - Property deed or mortgage statement
   - Photo ID
3. **File application between February 1 and June 30** of the filing year
4. **Processing time:** Typically 30-60 days
5. **Effective date:** Retroactive to January 1 of the tax year you apply (if filed by deadline)

**For $10,000 Universal Veteran Exemption (2025):**

Application process varies by county—contact your county assessor. You'll need your DD-214 and proof of honorable discharge. Most counties allow online applications or mail-in forms.

**For Proportional Exemption (Starting 2026):**

Application procedures will be established by county assessors in 2025. Expect to provide your VA rating letter and DD-214. Check with your county assessor in early 2026 for exact procedures.

### Property Tax by County

New Mexico property tax rates vary significantly by county and municipality. Here's how major counties compare:

| County | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Annual Savings (100% Disabled) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Bernalillo (Albuquerque) | $300,000 | 1.18% | $3,540 | $3,540 |
| Santa Fe | $490,000 | 0.51% | $2,499 | $2,499 |
| Doña Ana (Las Cruces) | $285,000 | 0.65% | $1,853 | $1,853 |
| San Juan (Farmington) | $275,000 | 0.75% | $2,063 | $2,063 |
| Valencia | $250,000 | 0.70% | $1,750 | $1,750 |
| Sandoval (Rio Rancho) | $310,000 | 0.79% | $2,449 | $2,449 |
| Chaves (Roswell) | $128,000 | 0.85% | $1,088 | $1,088 |

Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) has the highest effective property tax rate at 1.18%, meaning a 100% disabled veteran saves $3,540 annually on a median-priced home. Santa Fe County has lower rates (0.51%) but much higher home values, resulting in $2,499 annual savings.

Even in smaller, more affordable cities like Roswell, the exemption saves you over $1,000 per year.

**Payment Deadlines:** Property taxes are typically due in two installments—November 10 (first half) and April 10 (second half)—but check with your county treasurer for specific dates.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax exemption: $30,000 per year (2025)
- Annual savings: $1,500-$1,800 (depending on income and tax bracket)
- Eligibility: All military retirees (any branch, any service period)
- Surviving spouse benefit: Yes—surviving spouses can claim the same $30,000 exemption

New Mexico exempts up to $30,000 of military retirement pay from state income tax as of January 1, 2025. This exemption applies to all branches: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force, USPHS Commissioned Corps, and NOAA Corps officers.

The 2024 amendment made this exemption permanent (previously it had a sunset date) and extended it to surviving spouses of military retirees—a significant improvement for military families.

**Who qualifies:** Anyone receiving military retirement benefits reported on IRS Form 1099-R issued by the Department of Defense or Office of Personnel Management.

**How it works:** When filing your New Mexico state tax return, you exclude the first $30,000 of military retirement income from your taxable income. If you use tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block, indicate that your 1099-R is military retirement, and it'll automatically apply the exemption.

**Example calculation:**
- Annual military retirement: $50,000
- New Mexico exemption: $30,000
- Taxable retirement income: $20,000
- New Mexico tax rate: ~5.9% (top marginal rate)
- Tax owed on retirement: $1,180
- Compared to no exemption: $2,950
- **Annual savings: $1,770**

If your annual military retirement is $30,000 or less, you pay ZERO New Mexico state tax on it.

**Pending legislation:** Senate Bill 497 proposes removing the $30,000 cap entirely, allowing military retirees to exempt their entire retirement income from state taxes. If passed, this would put New Mexico on par with states like Mississippi and Alabama that fully exempt military retirement pay. Watch for updates in 2025-2026 legislative sessions.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt (like all states)
- Federal tax: Exempt
- State tax: Exempt

All VA disability compensation is tax-free at both the federal and state level. New Mexico doesn't tax it, and neither does the IRS. This is standard across all 50 states—VA disability payments are never taxable income.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Taxation: Subject to New Mexico income tax
- Federal taxation: Taxable as income
- State treatment: No special exemption

Unlike military retirement pay, Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments to spouses and dependents are taxable in New Mexico. There's no special exemption for SBP, so you'll pay state income tax on these benefits at standard rates.

However, the federal government eliminated the "widow's tax" (SBP-DIC offset) in 2021, so surviving spouses can now receive full SBP plus Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) from the VA without offset.

### Other Military Income

- **Active duty pay:** Taxable by New Mexico if you're a New Mexico resident
- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Taxable by New Mexico
- **Combat pay:** Generally exempt from federal tax; New Mexico follows federal treatment
- **National Guard/Reserve retirement:** Eligible for $30,000 exemption (same as active duty retirement)

If you're active duty stationed at Kirtland AFB or Holloman AFB but maintain legal residency in another state, you're not subject to New Mexico income tax on your military pay under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

### Disabled Veteran License Plates

**50% Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: FREE (no registration fees)
- Eligibility: Veterans with 50%+ service-connected disability rating
- Vehicles covered: Up to TWO vehicles per veteran (including motorcycles)
- Annual savings: $25-$50+ (standard registration fees waived)

This is one of New Mexico's best vehicle benefits. If you're 50% or higher disabled, you can register up to two vehicles completely free—no registration fees, no renewal fees. You'll still pay the 4% vehicle excise tax when purchasing, but ongoing registration is free.

**Other Veteran Specialty Plates:**
- Standard veteran plates: Available for $17 one-time fee, then regular annual registration applies
- Medal of Honor plates: FREE (no fees)
- Purple Heart plates: $17 one-time fee
- Various other military branch plates: $17 one-time fee

### Registration Fee Reduction (General Veterans)

Veterans entitled to property tax exemption who don't have sufficient real estate to claim the full exemption may be eligible for a one-third reduction in motor vehicle registration fees. This applies to vehicles they own.

**Savings:** Roughly $8-$15 per vehicle annually (one-third off standard $25-$50 fees)

### Severe Disability Motor Vehicle Tax Exemption

- **Eligibility:** Honorably discharged veterans who lost or lost the use of:
  - One or both arms (at or above the wrist), OR
  - One or both legs (at or above the ankle), OR
  - Amputation of one extremity plus loss of use of another
- **Benefit:** One motor vehicle exempt from motor vehicle excise taxes
- **Savings:** 4% of vehicle value (can be $800-$2,000+ on a new vehicle purchase)

This exemption is narrow but valuable for severely disabled veterans. It exempts you from the 4% motor vehicle excise tax (MVET) on one vehicle. If you buy a $40,000 truck, you save $1,600 in excise tax.

**How to apply:** Contact your county motor vehicle office with proof of disability and DD-214.

### Parking Privileges

- Standard veteran plates: No special parking privileges
- 50% disabled veteran plates: No automatic handicapped parking privileges
- Handicapped placard: Apply separately if you qualify based on mobility limitations

Disabled veteran plates alone don't grant handicapped parking access. You need a separate handicapped placard or handicapped-specific plates based on mobility impairment.

## Sales Tax Exemptions

- Vehicle purchases: 4% motor vehicle excise tax (no veteran exemption)
- Other purchases: 5.125% base state sales tax (no veteran exemptions)
- Local taxes: Vary by city/county (0.5%-3.9375% additional)

New Mexico doesn't offer sales tax exemptions for veterans on vehicle purchases or general goods. You'll pay the standard 4% motor vehicle excise tax when buying a car (unless you qualify for the severe disability exemption above) and 5.125%-9.06% sales tax on other purchases depending on location.

The only exception is the motor vehicle tax exemption for severely disabled veterans with lost or lost use of limbs (see above).

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% Disabled Veteran Example (Albuquerque):**
- Property tax saved (median home): $3,540
- Income tax saved (military retirement $40,000): $1,770
- Vehicle registration saved (2 vehicles): $50
- **Total Annual Savings: $5,360**

Over 20 years, that's $107,200 in tax savings. Over 30 years: $160,800.

**70% Disabled Veteran (Starting 2026):**
- Property tax saved (70% of $3,540): $2,478
- Universal veteran exemption ($10,000): $300
- Income tax saved (military retirement): $1,770
- Vehicle registration: Not eligible for free plates (need 50%+)
- **Total savings: $4,548/year**

**50% Disabled Veteran (Starting 2026):**
- Property tax saved (50% of $3,540): $1,770
- Universal veteran exemption: $300
- Income tax saved: $1,770
- Vehicle registration saved (2 vehicles): $50
- **Total savings: $3,890/year**

**30% Disabled Veteran (Starting 2026):**
- Property tax saved (30% of $3,540): $1,062
- Universal veteran exemption: $300
- Income tax saved: $1,770
- **Total savings: $3,132/year**

**Non-Disabled Military Retiree:**
- Property tax saved (universal exemption): $300
- Income tax saved: $1,770
- **Total savings: $2,070/year**

Even without a disability rating, military retirees save over $2,000 annually in New Mexico—and that number jumps dramatically if you have any VA rating.

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled:**
- Annual savings: $5,360
- 20-year total: $107,200
- 30-year total: $160,800
- Net present value (3% discount): $126,800

**70% Disabled (2026 onward):**
- Annual savings: $4,548
- 20-year total: $90,960
- Net present value: $72,000

**50% Disabled (2026 onward):**
- Annual savings: $3,890
- 20-year total: $77,800
- Net present value: $61,600

**Military Retiree (No VA rating):**
- Annual savings: $2,070
- 20-year total: $41,400
- Net present value: $32,800

New Mexico's property tax savings compound over decades, especially with the proportional exemption starting in 2026. Combined with military retirement income exemption, you're looking at five-figure savings over a typical retirement span.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Tax Exemption | All Veterans Property Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled) |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **New Mexico** | $30,000 exempt | Full exemption | $10,000 (2025) | $5,360 |
| Texas | No income tax | $12,000 exemption | $12,000 | ~$5,000 |
| Arizona | $3,500 exempt | Varies by county, up to $4,000 | None | $2,800 |
| Colorado | $24,000 exempt (55+) | Full exemption | $6,000 (certain veterans) | $4,500 |
| Oklahoma | 100% exempt (75%+ disabled) | Full exemption (100% disabled) | $1,000 | $5,200 |
| Utah | $39,800 exempt | Partial exemption | None | $3,200 |

**Verdict:** New Mexico ranks #1 or #2 among neighbors for 100% disabled veterans, tied with Oklahoma. Texas edges ahead slightly because it has no state income tax at all (vs. NM's $30,000 exemption), but New Mexico's proportional property tax system starting in 2026 makes it superior for veterans rated 50-90%.

For non-disabled military retirees, Texas wins (no income tax), but New Mexico is competitive and more affordable for cost of living.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Property tax exemption:** Excellent—proportional system for all disabled veterans places NM in top 10 nationally
- **Income tax treatment:** Good—$30,000 exemption is solid but not exceptional (12 states have no income tax; 20+ states fully exempt military retirement)
- **Overall ranking:** Top 15 nationally for 100% disabled veterans; top 20 for all veterans

New Mexico's 2024-2026 tax reforms have vaulted it into the top tier of veteran-friendly states. The universal $10,000 property exemption and proportional disability exemptions are among the best in the nation. The military retirement exemption could be better (pending legislation may fix this), but overall, New Mexico is highly competitive.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- 100% disabled veterans (save $5,000+/year)
- Veterans rated 50%+ disabled (massive savings starting 2026 with proportional exemptions)
- Military retirees with pensions under $30,000 (completely exempt from state income tax)
- Veterans seeking affordable cost of living + generous tax benefits

**Less beneficial for:**
- High-income military retirees with $60,000+ pensions (only $30,000 exempt—Texas or Florida have no income tax)
- Active duty with out-of-state residency (already don't pay NM tax under SCRA)

**Better options:**
- If you want zero income tax and have a high military pension, consider Texas, Florida, Nevada, Tennessee, or Washington
- If you're less than 50% disabled and want better property tax breaks, check Oklahoma (100% disabled only, but full exemption)

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- New Mexico estate tax: None
- New Mexico inheritance tax: None
- Federal estate tax: Applies if estate exceeds $13.61 million (2024)

New Mexico doesn't impose state estate or inheritance taxes. When you pass away, your beneficiaries won't owe state taxes on inherited property or assets.

### Other Tax Benefits

**Income Tax Exemptions:**
- Social Security: Not taxed by New Mexico
- Railroad retirement: Partially exempt
- Military retirement: $30,000 exempt (as discussed)

New Mexico doesn't tax Social Security benefits, which is a significant benefit for retirees combining VA disability, Social Security, and military retirement income.

### New Mexico Veteran State Park Pass

- **Cost:** FREE (lifetime pass for all NM resident veterans, starting July 1, 2025)
- **Value:** $225-$300/year if you frequently camp
- **Benefit:** Free day-use entry and camping at all NM state parks

Starting July 1, 2025, New Mexico resident veterans receive a lifetime pass providing free day-use and camping access at all state parks. If you camp 5-10 nights per year, this saves you $200-$300 annually. Over 6,000 veterans have already claimed this pass.

**How to apply:** Email vet.benefits@dvs.nm.gov or call 1-866-433-8387.

### Hunting & Fishing License Discounts

**50% Discount (All Veterans):**
- Applies to all licenses, permits, and stamps
- Must be NM resident veteran or active duty
- Saves $50-$150/year depending on what you hunt/fish

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Free lifetime Game-hunting & Fishing License
- Free deer hunting license annually

**Less Than 100% Disabled:**
- $10 Game-hunting & Fishing License

Contact NM Department of Game & Fish: 1-888-248-6866.

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Apply for the $10,000 universal property tax exemption immediately** if you're a veteran (any rating). Contact your county assessor. This is free money—don't wait.

2. **If you're 100% disabled, apply for the full property tax exemption between February 1–June 30, 2025.** You could be losing $300-$500+ per month if you delay.

3. **If you're 50-90% disabled, prepare to apply for the proportional property tax exemption in early 2026.** Check your county assessor's website in January 2026 for application procedures. This will save you thousands annually.

4. **Update your New Mexico tax withholding if you're a military retiree.** Since the first $30,000 of retirement pay is exempt, adjust your W-4 with DFAS to avoid over-withholding. Get your money now instead of waiting for a refund.

5. **If you're 50%+ disabled, get your free disabled veteran license plates.** Save $25-$50/year on two vehicles. Apply at your county motor vehicle office with your VA rating letter and DD-214.

6. **Claim your lifetime state park pass.** Email vet.benefits@dvs.nm.gov. If you camp even once or twice a year, this saves money.

7. **Watch for Senate Bill 497 updates.** If this passes, military retirees can exempt their entire retirement income from state taxes—not just $30,000. Follow NM legislative news in 2025-2026.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Missing the June 30 property tax exemption deadline:** Apply early—don't wait until the last minute. If you miss it, you'll pay full property tax for that year.

- **Not applying for the universal $10,000 exemption:** Even if you're not disabled, all veterans get this starting 2025. Don't leave $300-$600/year on the table.

- **Assuming you don't qualify because you're not 100% disabled:** Starting 2026, ANY VA disability rating gets you a proportional property tax exemption. 30% disabled? You get 30% off. Apply.

- **Forgetting to notify DFAS about the $30,000 military retirement exemption:** Update your withholding to keep more money in your paycheck.

- **Not checking for county-specific benefits:** Some counties offer additional veteran benefits beyond state programs. Call your county assessor and treasurer to ask.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?**

A: For 100% disabled veterans, check with your county assessor—requirements vary by county. Some require annual verification, others allow multi-year certifications. For the universal $10,000 exemption, application procedures are still being finalized by counties.

**Q: When does the proportional property tax exemption for veterans under 100% disabled start?**

A: Tax year 2026. You'll apply in early 2026 for property taxes due that year. The exemption applies to tax years 2026 and beyond.

**Q: Can I get both the universal $10,000 exemption AND the proportional disability exemption?**

A: This is being clarified by state tax authorities. Most likely, you'll receive whichever benefit is greater, or they may stack. Check with your county assessor in early 2026.

**Q: I'm a military retiree with $50,000 annual pension. How much do I pay in NM state tax?**

A: You exclude the first $30,000, so you pay tax on $20,000. At New Mexico's top rate (~5.9%), that's roughly $1,180 in state tax. Without the exemption, you'd pay about $2,950, so you save $1,770/year.

**Q: Does the property tax exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. It only applies to your primary residence.

**Q: I just retired from the military and moved to New Mexico. How do I claim the $30,000 retirement exemption?**

A: When you file your New Mexico state tax return, report your military retirement income but exclude $30,000 from taxable income. Tax software like TurboTax will guide you through this. There's no separate application—you just claim it on your return.

**Q: Are National Guard and Reserve retirement payments eligible for the $30,000 exemption?**

A: Yes. Guard and Reserve retirement (including "grey area" retired pay) is treated the same as active duty retirement—$30,000 is exempt from New Mexico state tax.

**Q: I'm stationed at Kirtland AFB but my home of record is California. Do I pay New Mexico income tax?**

A: No, as long as you maintain California residency. Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), you're not subject to New Mexico income tax on your military pay if you're a legal resident of another state.

**Q: Can I get the 50% disabled veteran free license plates if I'm rated 60%?**

A: Yes. Any disability rating of 50% or higher qualifies you for two free license plate registrations.

**Q: Does my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption if I die?**

A: Surviving spouses are included in the proportional exemption (starting 2026) and may qualify for certain exemptions. Contact your county assessor immediately to understand your options. The military retirement income exemption ($30,000) DOES extend to surviving spouses.

**Q: What's the difference between the 100% disabled property tax exemption and the universal $10,000 exemption?**

A: The 100% disabled exemption eliminates ALL property tax on your primary residence. The universal $10,000 exemption reduces your assessed property value by $10,000 (saving you $300-$600/year depending on county rates). If you're 100% disabled, you get the full exemption. If you're not disabled, you get the $10,000 reduction.

**Q: I'm 80% disabled. Should I wait until 2026 to buy a house in New Mexico?**

A: Not necessarily. You'll get the $10,000 universal exemption in 2025, then the 80% proportional exemption will kick in for 2026. Buying in 2025 locks in current home prices, and you'll still benefit from partial exemptions immediately.

**Q: Does New Mexico tax VA disability compensation?**

A: No. VA disability compensation is tax-free federally and in every state, including New Mexico.

**Q: If I move to New Mexico mid-year, can I still get the property tax exemption for that year?**

A: Yes, but you must establish New Mexico residency and apply by June 30. The exemption typically applies starting the year you establish residency. Check with your county assessor for specific rules.

**Q: Do I pay property tax while my exemption application is being processed?**

A: Pay any property taxes due while your application is pending. If approved, the exemption is typically retroactive to January 1 of the tax year you applied (if filed by June 30), and you'll receive a refund.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I overpaid property taxes before I knew about the exemption?**

A: Generally, you can only get a refund for the current tax year. If you recently became disabled or recently learned about the exemption, apply immediately. For prior years, refunds are unlikely, but consult your county treasurer.
