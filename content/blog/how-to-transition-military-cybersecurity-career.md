# How to Transition to Cybersecurity: Military IT to Security Career Path

## Bottom Line Up Front

**If you're military IT (17C, 25B, 25D) with cyber/security background, cybersecurity is your natural path.** You can transition in **6-12 months** with Security+ certification and your military experience. **Cost: $500-$2,000 for certifications.** **Salary: $80K-$110K starting (much higher than regular IT), $120K-$180K within 5 years, $150K-$250K+ as senior security engineer or manager.** Cybersecurity demand is extreme—jobs go unfilled. Your military security clearance is worth $20K-$50K.

**Your advantage:** Military cyber operations = exact experience companies are desperate for.

## Why Cybersecurity Needs Military Talent

Cybersecurity is offense and defense. Military cyber ops is literally that. You've done this.

**Specific advantages:**
- **Combat experience:** You've fought adversaries. Cyber is different but mentality is same.
- **Threat modeling:** You understand how adversaries think (you've been one).
- **Defensive posture:** You understand what needs protection and why.
- **Security clearance:** You've been vetted. Companies trust you.
- **Discipline:** Security is process-heavy. Military = natural fit.
- **High-stakes thinking:** You're used to consequences. Cyber breaches have consequences.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge #1: "I'm Not Technical Enough"

**Reality:** You can be. Technology is learnable.

**Solution:**
- Take CompTIA A+ first (6 months)
- Get help desk IT job (learn hands-on)
- Then do Security+ (3 months)
- Then transition to security

**Timeline extended:** 2-3 years to SOC role vs. 1 year with IT background. But doable.

### Challenge #2: "Security+ is Hard"

**Reality:** It's moderate difficulty. Memorization + concepts.

**Solution:**
- Use quality study materials (Udemy, CompTIA guides)
- Do practice tests (critical!)
- Take multiple practice exams before real exam
- Most people with IT background pass first try

### Challenge #3: "Cybersecurity Job Market is Oversaturated"

**Reality:** Opposite. Jobs outnumber candidates significantly.

**Reality check:**
- 500K+ open cybersecurity jobs (US)
- ~100K qualified candidates
- Employers desperately hiring
- Salaries increasing
- Definitely not oversaturated

### Challenge #4: "I Have a Clearance but Don't Know How to Leverage It"

**Reality:** Tell employers immediately.

**In resume:** "Active Secret Security Clearance (eligible for TS)" — prominent statement

**In interviews:** "I have clearance, reducing onboarding timeline and allowing me to work on classified projects immediately"

**In salary negotiation:** "Clearance is worth +$20-30K premium for classified work"

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need Security+ before getting a security job?**
A: Strongly preferred, often required. Get it first.

**Q: What's the difference between offensive and defensive?**
A: Defensive = protect (SOC, security engineer). Offensive = attack (pen tester, ethical hacker). Both have demand, different personalities suit each.

**Q: Can I do cybersecurity without military IT background?**
A: Yes, but takes 2-3 years longer (need to get IT background first). Possible but slower.

**Q: Is CEH worth getting?**
A: If going offensive (pen testing), yes. If defensive, CISSP or GCIH more valuable. CEH is "nice to have" but not necessary.

**Q: How much will military cyber experience help?**
A: Huge. You'll be hired faster, paid more, trusted more. You know actual threat tactics. That's extremely valuable.
