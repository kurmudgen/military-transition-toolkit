## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 13B Cannon Crewmembers transitioning out—your **artillery operations expertise, precision calculations, crew coordination, heavy equipment operation, ammunition handling, safety protocols, technical proficiency, and ability to execute missions requiring mathematical accuracy under pressure** make you competitive across heavy equipment operation, precision manufacturing, skilled trades, law enforcement, logistics, and technical fields. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$75,000** in equipment operation, technical trades, or logistics roles, scaling to **$85,000-$130,000** in specialized equipment operation, quality control, or federal positions. Senior equipment operators, maintenance supervisors, and specialized technical roles can earn **$95,000-$160,000+**.

You didn't just "load shells"—you operated and maintained multi-million dollar howitzer systems (M777, M109 Paladin), calculated firing data using ballistics and meteorology, coordinated complex fire missions requiring split-second crew synchronization, managed ammunition inventory and safety protocols, performed technical maintenance on hydraulic and mechanical systems, communicated mission-critical information using precise military procedures, and executed time-sensitive missions where a single calculation error could result in friendly fire. That's precision operations, mathematical proficiency, crew leadership, quality control, technical troubleshooting, and zero-defect execution. The civilian world needs those skills in roles requiring exactness and technical competence.

Most 13B cannoneers transition to heavy equipment operation, precision manufacturing/quality control, skilled trades (welding, machining, HVAC), law enforcement, logistics/supply chain, or technical instruction. Your transition timeline is 6-12 months with strategic planning. Start 9-12 months before ETS.

## What Does an Army 13B Cannon Crewmember Do?

As a 13B Cannon Crewmember, you operated as part of an artillery crew on towed (M777 155mm) or self-propelled (M109 Paladin 155mm) howitzers. Your responsibilities varied by crew position:

**Chief of Section/Gun Chief:** Led 6-8 person crew, coordinated fire missions, communicated with fire direction center, ensured safety protocols, maintained accountability for equipment and ammunition, and made tactical decisions affecting mission execution.

**Gunner:** Operated gun's elevation and traversing mechanisms, set deflection and quadrant elevation based on fire commands, maintained gun's mechanical systems, and ensured precision targeting.

**Assistant Gunner:** Assisted with gun operations, set fuses on projectiles, managed ammunition preparation, maintained fire control equipment, and served as backup gunner.

**Ammunition Handler/Loader:** Loaded projectiles and propellant charges, managed ammunition inventory, ensured safety protocols, prepared charges based on fire mission requirements, and maintained ammunition readiness.

**Driver (M109 Paladin):** Operated self-propelled howitzer, navigated to firing positions, performed driver-level maintenance, positioned vehicle for optimal firing angles, and ensured vehicle readiness.
