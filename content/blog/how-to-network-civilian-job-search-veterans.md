# How to Network Effectively for Your Civilian Job Search: Veteran Networking Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

70% of jobs are filled through networking, not job applications. Most veterans network poorly because they either wait for others to reach out or approach networking too aggressively. This guide provides proven networking strategies, conversation templates, and relationship-building frameworks that generate job opportunities without feeling transactional or uncomfortable.

## Why Networking Matters More Than Job Applications

**The Reality:**
- 70% of jobs filled through networking
- Only 15% of open positions posted publicly
- Referrals have 4x higher hire rate than applications
- Recruiters spend 2x more time on referred candidates

For veterans, networking is especially critical because:
1. You're career-changing (need insider knowledge)
2. Civilian employers don't understand military experience
3. Referred candidates get "translation" help from referrer
4. Network provides mentorship during transition

## The Four Networking Phases for Job Transition

### Phase 1: Reconnect (Weeks 1-3)

Before reaching out to strangers, reconnect with your existing network.

**Who to Reconnect With:**
- Military colleagues (enlisted and officers)
- Former supervisors/leaders
- College/university classmates
- Neighbors/friends from past locations
- Alumni from your college
- Professional association members

**Reconnection Email Template:**

```
Subject: Let's Catch Up - Transitioning to Civilian Role

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I'm transitioning from military to civilian work and your experience [specific reason: in operations, tech, leadership, etc.] would be invaluable.

I'm not immediately asking for anything—I'd love to just catch up and get your advice on the industry/roles I'm targeting. Would you be open to a 15-20 minute coffee/call in the next few weeks?

[Your story in 1-2 sentences: "I'm transitioning from 12 years in military operations to supply chain management and would benefit from your insights."]

Thanks, and hope to hear from you soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific reason for reaching out (not "let's be friends")
- Limited ask (15-20 minutes, not vague "let's catch up")
- You're seeking advice (most people want to help)
- Clear next step

### Phase 2: Informational Interviews (Weeks 2-6)

Once you've reconnected, ask for informational interviews with people in your target roles.

**How to Request Informational Interview:**

```
Subject: 15-Minute Conversation About Your Role in Operations

Hi [Name],

[Your referrer's name] mentioned you're doing excellent work in operations management at [Company]. I'm transitioning from military to civilian operations role and would love to learn more about:

• What does a typical day look like in your operations role?
• What skills are most critical for success in operations management?
• How did you transition into operations? (if applicable)
• Any advice for someone entering this field from military background?

Would you have 15-20 minutes for a call in the next two weeks? I'm flexible with timing.

Thanks so much,
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific questions (not "tell me about your job")
- Shows you've done homework (named their company/role)
- Specific ask (15-20 minutes, specific timeframe)
- Clear agenda

**During Informational Interview:**
- Listen more than talk (70/30 rule)
- Take notes (shows you care)
- Ask follow-up questions
- Ask for one additional referral at the end
- Never ask for job directly (yet)

**Sample Informational Interview Questions:**

1. "What does a typical day look like in your role?"
2. "What are the 3-5 most important skills for success?"
3. "What was your path to this role?"
4. "What surprised you most when you started?"
5. "How is the industry changing?"
6. "What does your company look for when hiring?"
7. "Any advice for someone transitioning into operations?"
8. "Would you mind introducing me to [specific type of person: operations director, hiring manager at similar company]?"

### Phase 3: Expand Network (Weeks 4-8)

Systematically expand beyond your immediate network.

**Networking Activities:**

**Activity 1: LinkedIn Outreach**
- Search for "Operations Manager" in target cities
- Find people who work at target companies
- Write personalized connection requests
- Reference mutual connections when possible

**LinkedIn Connection Message Template:**

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're doing [specific work: operations management at Company]. I'm transitioning from military operations to civilian roles and would appreciate any insights you could share.

Would you be open to connecting? I'd love to hear about your path into operations.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Activity 2: Industry Events & Meetups**
- Join Meetup.com groups in your target industry
- Attend 1-2 networking events per month
- APTA meetings, industry conferences, chamber of commerce
- Military transitioning groups and veteran networking events

**At Networking Events:**
- Arrive early (less crowded, easier conversations)
- Have business cards
- Introduce yourself with 30-second pitch (see below)
- Ask questions, listen actively
- Exchange contact information
- Follow up within 48 hours

**Networking Event 30-Second Pitch:**

"Hi, I'm [Name]. I'm transitioning from military operations management to the civilian supply chain field. I'm interested in learning how companies like yours manage logistics operations. What brings you to this event?"

**Activity 3: Informational Interview Referrals**
After each informational interview, ask: "Who else would be valuable for me to talk with?"

Most people will refer 1-2 others. These warm introductions are gold.

### Phase 4: Create Opportunities (Weeks 6-12)

By now, you've built relationships. Use them to create job opportunities.

**Option A: Ask for Introductions to Hiring Managers**

Once you've talked to 5-10 people in your target role, identify hiring managers at target companies. Ask your network contacts to introduce you.

```
Hi [Name from previous informational interview],

Thanks again for our conversation last month about operations management at [Company type]. Based on what you shared, I'm very interested in working in operations at companies like yours.

I noticed that [Target Company] is hiring for an Operations Manager role. Do you know anyone at [Company] I could talk to about their operations? Even an introduction to someone in operations (not necessarily hiring) would be helpful.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Option B: Let Your Network Know You're Actively Seeking**

After 6-8 weeks of informational interviews, send an update to your network:

```
Hi [Network],

I wanted to update you on my transition progress. I'm actively seeking an Operations Manager or Supply Chain Coordinator role in [target industry/location]. I'm open to:

• Full-time positions
• Contract/freelance work
• Consulting opportunities

If you hear of anything, please let me know. And if you know anyone in operations I should talk to, I'd appreciate the introduction.

Thanks for your support during my transition.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Networking Conversation Framework

### Opening (2 minutes)
- Greeting and small talk
- Acknowledge how you were connected
- Express appreciation for their time

**Example:** "Hi Sarah, thanks so much for taking time. I really appreciate it. [Mutual contact] mentioned you've had a great career in operations, and I wanted to learn from your experience."

### Context (2 minutes)
- Briefly explain your transition
- Why you're interested in their field
- What you're trying to learn

**Example:** "I'm transitioning from 12 years in military operations to civilian supply chain management. I'm interested in understanding how companies approach supply chain differently, and what's most important for success in this field."

### Questions (10 minutes)
- Ask prepared questions
- Listen actively, take notes
- Ask follow-up questions
- Build on what they share

### Closing (2-3 minutes)
- Thank them specifically
- Ask for referrals
- Confirm how to stay in touch
- Mention following up

**Example:** "This has been really helpful. I really appreciate your insights on [specific topic]. Would you mind if I connected with you on LinkedIn? And if you know anyone else in operations I should talk to, I'd appreciate the introduction."

## Common Networking Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Being Too Direct About Job Search
**Wrong:** "Do you know anyone hiring?"
**Right:** "I'm interested in learning more about operations. Would you recommend anyone else I should talk to?"

### Mistake 2: Not Following Up After Meetings
**Wrong:** Talk to someone, never contact again
**Right:** Send thank you email within 48 hours, check in monthly

**Follow-Up Email Template:**

```
Subject: Thanks for Your Time - [Date] Call

Hi [Name],

Thanks so much for taking time to talk with me about operations at [Company type]. Your insight about [specific topic they discussed] was particularly helpful.

[Reference one specific thing they said that was valuable to you]

I'll keep you updated on my transition. If you hear of any opportunities or know anyone else I should talk to, please let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Mistake 3: Only Networking When Desperate
**Wrong:** Reach out only when you're unemployed and desperate
**Right:** Network continuously, before you need a job

### Mistake 4: Talking About Yourself Too Much
**Wrong:** Talk 70% of the time
**Right:** Listen 70% of the time, talk 30%

### Mistake 5: Being Too Salesy
**Wrong:** "I'm perfect for your team. You should hire me."
**Right:** "I'm learning about the operations field and would appreciate any advice."

### Mistake 6: Poor Body Language (for in-person networking)
**Wrong:** Closed posture, no eye contact, checking phone
**Right:** Open posture, eye contact, fully present

### Mistake 7: Not Staying Organized
**Wrong:** Meet 20 people, forget who said what
**Right:** Keep spreadsheet of contacts, dates, conversations, next steps

## Networking CRM (Contact Relationship Management)

Create simple spreadsheet to track your network:

| Name | Company | Role | Date Met | Key Info | Follow-up Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| John Smith | XYZ Logistics | VP Operations | 3/15 | Interested in supply chain improvement | 4/15 | Connected |
| Sarah Lee | ABC Supply | Manager | 3/20 | Knows hiring manager at DEF Corp | 4/20 | Awaiting intro |
| Mike Johnson | MilitaryNetwork | Recruiter | 3/25 | Specializes in veteran placements | 4/25 | Active |

This prevents "who was that person and what did we talk about?" scenario.
