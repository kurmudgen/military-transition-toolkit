# Military Skills Translator: Find Your Civilian Career Match (Complete Guide to All Tools)

You've been told to "use a military skills translator" about 47 times since you started your separation process. Cool. But which one? And more importantly, how do you actually use the results to land a job?

There are at least 6 different military skills translator tools out there. Some are great. Some are garbage. None of them give you the full picture alone.

Here's what nobody tells you: these tools are just starting points. They'll tell you "project manager" or "network administrator," but they won't tell you how to translate your experience for a resume, which companies are actually hiring, or what those jobs really pay.

This guide covers every major military skills translator tool, what makes each one useful (or useless), and how to actually use the results to get hired. Not just get suggestions - get hired.

## How to Actually Use These Tools (Step-by-Step Process)

Here's the process nobody tells you about. Don't just use one tool and call it done. Use them in sequence:

### Step 1: Start with O*NET (30 minutes)
1. Go to mynextmove.org/vets
2. Enter your military code
3. Look at the top 5 job matches
4. For each match, click through and read:
   - Job duties (what you'll actually do)
   - Salary range (know your worth)
   - Required education (do you need more school?)
   - On-the-job training (can you learn as you go?)

**Write down:**
- 3 job titles that sound interesting
- Salary ranges for each
- Any certifications mentioned

### Step 2: Cross-check with Military.com (20 minutes)
1. Go to military.com/veteran-jobs/skills-translator
2. Enter your code again
3. Compare results to O*NET
4. Look for job titles that appear on BOTH lists (these are your strongest matches)
5. Click "Find Jobs" and note companies that are hiring

**Write down:**
- Companies actively hiring for your matches
- Job titles that appeared on both lists
- Any new job titles that make sense

### Step 3: Check CareerOneStop for Local Options (20 minutes)
1. Go to careeronestop.org/veterans
2. Enter your military code AND your location
3. Filter by veteran-friendly employers
4. Look at training programs available locally
5. Note any state-specific licensing requirements

**Write down:**
- Local companies in your field
- Required state licenses or certifications
- Local training programs (some are free for veterans)

### Step 4: LinkedIn for Real People (Ongoing)
1. Update your LinkedIn profile
2. Search for the job titles you identified
3. Find people who have those jobs
4. Send connection requests with a brief note:
   - "Hi [Name], I'm transitioning from the military and researching [job title]. Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share your experience?"

**Goal:** Talk to 3-5 people in roles you want within the next month

### Step 5: Translate Your Resume
Now comes the important part. You have job titles. You have tasks. You have salary ranges. Now translate your actual experience.

**For each job title you're targeting:**
1. Pull up the O*NET detailed task list
2. Match YOUR actual duties to the civilian task language
3. Rewrite your resume bullets using that civilian language
4. Include specific metrics (numbers, percentages, dollar values)

**Example: Infantry Squad Leader → Operations Manager**

**Military resume bullet:**
"Led squad of 9 soldiers through 150+ combat patrols"

**Civilian resume bullet (using O*NET language):**
"Managed team of 9 in high-stress environment, planning and executing 150+ operations with zero safety incidents"

See the difference? Same experience, different language.

## Branch-Specific Tips

### Army (MOS Codes)
- Most MOS codes translate clearly (68W → EMT/Paramedic, 25B → IT Support, 92Y → Supply Chain)
- NCO leadership experience is often MORE valuable than your technical MOS
- Focus on translating leadership and management experience for E6+

### Air Force (AFSC)
- AFSC translations are usually more technical than other branches
- Civilian employers understand Air Force = technical expertise
- Emphasize your certifications (Sec+, clearance, etc.)

### Navy (Ratings)
- Navy ratings are the HARDEST to translate (what's an "FC"?)
- Spend extra time explaining your role in civilian terms
- Use O*NET heavily for the task-level translations

### Marines (MOS)
- Infantry MOS translation is tough - focus on leadership, not "combat"
- Emphasize problem-solving, team leadership, adaptability
- Look at operations, logistics, and management roles

### Coast Guard (Ratings)
- Smaller branch = fewer automatic matches
- Focus on maritime, law enforcement, safety roles
- Government agencies (FEMA, DHS, CBP) understand CG experience

## Common Translation Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Using one tool and stopping**
Each tool has different strengths. Use at least 3 to get the full picture.

**Mistake #2: Accepting the first match**
The top match isn't always the best match. Read through multiple options.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring local opportunities**
National job boards are competitive. Local veteran-friendly employers are goldmines.

**Mistake #4: Not networking**
Tools give you titles. People give you jobs. Use LinkedIn to connect with real humans.

**Mistake #5: Copying military language to your resume**
"Fire team leader" means nothing to civilians. "Supervised team of 4 in high-pressure environment" means everything.

## What If the Matches Suck?

Sometimes the translator tools give you terrible matches. "Your infantry skills translate to forestry technician!" Uh, no thanks.

Here's what to do:

**Option 1: Focus on soft skills**
Your technical MOS might not translate, but leadership, problem-solving, and adaptability do. Look at:
- Operations Manager
- Project Manager
- Logistics Coordinator
- Business Analyst

**Option 2: Get certified**
Pick a civilian field that interests you and get certified before you separate:
- Tech: CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+
- Project Management: PMP, CAPM
- Supply Chain: APICS CSCP
- Trades: Use SkillBridge for apprenticeship

**Option 3: Use SkillBridge**
If you're within 180 days of separation, SkillBridge lets you intern with civilian companies while still on active duty. This is better than any translator tool.

**Option 4: Go to school**
GI Bill is money on the table. If your skills don't translate well, use education to bridge the gap.

## How to Use Translation Results on Your Resume

Once you have your civilian job titles and task descriptions, here's how to structure your resume:

### Resume Format for Veterans

**Top Section: Professional Summary**
Use your civilian job title target, not your military rank.

❌ Wrong: "Staff Sergeant with 8 years logistics experience"
✅ Right: "Supply Chain Professional with 8 years managing logistics operations for $50M+ inventory"

**Experience Section: Translate Each Role**

**Format:**
- **Civilian Job Title Equivalent** | Military Unit | Dates
- Bullet point using civilian language and metrics
- Bullet point using civilian language and metrics
- Bullet point using civilian language and metrics

**Example:**

**Operations Manager** | 1st Infantry Division | 2018-2024
- Managed daily operations for 45-person team, ensuring 98% on-time mission completion rate
- Coordinated logistics for 200+ operations valued at $5M+ in equipment and resources
- Implemented process improvements reducing equipment downtime by 35%
- Trained and supervised 12 team members on safety procedures and operational standards

### Keywords to Include
Based on your translator results, sprinkle these throughout your resume:
- The exact job title you're applying for
- Industry-specific software or systems
- Certifications (even if in-progress)
- Measurable outcomes (%, $, time saved)
- Leadership and team management
- Compliance and safety
- Process improvement

## The Bottom Line on Skills Translators

Here's the truth: skills translator tools are useful, but they're just the starting point.

**What they DO:**
- Give you civilian job title ideas
- Show you salary ranges
- Help you understand what's possible

**What they DON'T DO:**
- Write your resume for you
- Get you interviews
- Replace networking and research

**Your actual process:**
1. Use 3+ translator tools to identify job titles (1 hour)
2. Research those roles on LinkedIn and Glassdoor (2 hours)
3. Talk to real people in those roles (ongoing)
4. Translate your resume using civilian language (4 hours)
5. Apply to 5-10 jobs per week (ongoing)
6. Network, follow up, interview (ongoing)

The translator is step 1 out of 100. It's important, but it's not magic.

Start with O*NET for detailed info, cross-check with Military.com for employers, use LinkedIn to connect with real people, and translate your resume using civilian language.

That's how you actually use a military skills translator to get hired.
