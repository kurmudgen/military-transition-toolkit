## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 11C Indirect Fire Infantrymen transitioning out—your **mortar systems expertise, fire direction coordination, ballistics calculations, crew leadership, tactical operations experience, and precision under pressure** make you competitive across law enforcement, technical fields, skilled trades, and defense contracting. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$75,000** in law enforcement, technical trades, or logistics roles, scaling to **$90,000-$150,000** in federal law enforcement, emergency management, or specialized technical positions. Defense contractors, training roles, and senior technical positions can earn **$120,000-$200,000+**. Your technical precision and tactical expertise are valuable—target the right industries.

You didn't just "carry mortars"—you calculated firing solutions with zero margin for error, coordinated indirect fire missions supporting ground operations, led crews under fire, maintained complex weapons systems, communicated fire missions using precise military terminology, and executed time-sensitive operations where accuracy meant the difference between mission success and friendly casualties. That's technical mastery, mathematical precision, crisis communication, quality control, and operational coordination. The civilian world needs those skills in roles ranging from law enforcement to technical instruction to precision manufacturing.

Most 11Cs land in law enforcement, defense contracting (training and instruction), technical fields (surveying, mapping, quality control), skilled trades (especially precision work), logistics coordination, or emergency management. Your transition timeline is 6-12 months with strategic planning. Start 9-12 months before ETS.

## What Does an Army 11C Indirect Fire Infantryman Do?

As an 11C Indirect Fire Infantryman, you operated crew-served mortars (60mm, 81mm, 120mm), calculated firing data using fire direction procedures, directed mortar crew operations, executed fire missions in support of maneuver forces, maintained accountability for ammunition and equipment, and ensured precision delivery of indirect fire. You planned and coordinated mortar fires, calculated range and deflection, applied meteorological data, corrected rounds based on observer feedback, and maintained mortars and fire control equipment.

Your role required mathematical proficiency (ballistics calculations), attention to detail (precision is life-or-death), crew leadership, clear communication under pressure, technical troubleshooting, physical endurance, and the ability to execute complex procedures flawlessly while under fire. You operated in high-stress environments where a single calculation error could result in friendly fire—the ultimate accountability.

- Apply to federal law enforcement (FBI, DEA—12-18 month process)
- Connect with 20+ veterans in target fields (LinkedIn)
- Identify certifications needed

### 6-9 Months Before ETS
- Enroll in certification programs (GIS, surveying, trade school, CDL)
- Apply to SkillBridge (last 180 days—try civilian career)
- Submit 20-30 job applications
- Attend veteran job fairs
- Get state security license if targeting security
- Network aggressively—informational interviews

### 3-6 Months Before ETS
- Attend interviews
- Pass background checks/polygraphs (federal LE)
- Negotiate job offers
- Complete pre-employment requirements
- Coordinate start date with terminal leave
- Finalize housing if relocating

### Final 3 Months

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Assuming Your MOS is "Too Specialized" for Civilian Work**
Wrong. Your precision, technical skills, and mathematical proficiency are valuable. You just need to translate them.

**2. Targeting Only "Artillery" or "Weapons" Jobs**
There are very few civilian mortar jobs. Cast a wider net: surveying, GIS, quality control, law enforcement, training.

**3. Underselling Your Technical Skills**
You performed complex ballistics calculations under fire. That's advanced math, precision work, and crisis management. Emphasize this.

**4. Skipping Certifications**
GIS, surveying, and trade certifications open doors your experience alone won't. Invest the time.

**5. Not Using GI Bill Strategically**
Don't waste it on a degree you don't need. Use it for high-ROI certifications and training.

**6. Waiting Until Terminal Leave**
Start 9-12 months out. Federal jobs take 12-18 months.

**7. Being Inflexible on Location**
Willing to relocate = 10x more opportunities.
