# How to Get and Maintain Security Clearance for Civilian Job: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

An active security clearance is one of the most valuable assets you have as a transitioning military professional, worth $10,000-$50,000/year in salary premium. Most veterans don't understand how to maintain or leverage their clearance, losing this significant advantage. This guide shows you how to maintain your clearance, find high-paying clearance-required jobs, and maximize this career asset.

## Understanding Security Clearances in Civilian Market

### What Is a Security Clearance?

A security clearance is government authorization to access classified information. Three main levels:

**Secret (S)**
- Most common
- Access to Secret level classified information
- Many contractor jobs require this
- Salary premium: $5,000-$15,000/year
- Processing time: 6-12 months (if needed)

**Top Secret (TS)**
- Higher level access
- Significant salary premium
- Processing time: 12-18+ months (if needed)
- Requires extensive background investigation

**Top Secret/SCI (TS/SCI)**
- Highest level civilian clearance
- Access to compartmented information
- Highest salary premium
- Most rigorous requirements
- Processing time: 18+ months (if needed)

### Why Clearances Matter in Civilian Job Market

**Salary Premium by Clearance:**

| Clearance | Salary Premium | Job Opportunities |
|---|---|---|
| No clearance | Baseline | Competitive field |
| Secret clearance | $5K-15K/year | 30% more opportunities |
| Top Secret | $15K-30K/year | Significant advantage |
| TS/SCI | $25K-50K/year | Limited candidates, high demand |

**Example:**
- Same job: Operations Manager
- Without clearance: $75,000/year
- With Secret clearance: $82,000-90,000/year
- With Top Secret: $90,000-105,000/year
- With TS/SCI: $100,000-125,000/year

## Step 1: Determine Your Clearance Status

**Check Your Current Clearance:**

### What Type of Clearance Did You Have?

- Secret (S)
- Secret/SCI (S/SCI)
- Top Secret (TS)
- Top Secret/SCI (TS/SCI)
- Top Secret/SCI with Polygraph (TS/SCI/Poly)
- Secret/SCI with Polygraph (S/SCI/Poly)
- Confidential (older, rarely used now)
- Other specialized clearances

### Check If Your Clearance Is Active

**Clearance Expiration:**

Most clearances issued by military expire after:
- 5 years if not used continuously
- 5-10 years if actively used
- Some may be revoked at separation if you leave federal service

**Check Your Clearance Status:**

1. **DoD Clearance Verification**
   - Contact Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) / Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA)
   - Verify clearance status through previous security officer
   - Request letter from military confirming active/inactive status

2. **eBenefits (if available)**
   - Log into VA eBenefits
   - Some clearance information available there

3. **Ask Your Last Employer**
   - Security office at final assignment
   - Ask for clearance termination/continuity letter
   - Get specific clearance level and adjudication date

### Clearance Status Categories

**Active Clearance**
- You left military with active clearance
- Can be transferred to cleared contractor job
- Stays active if "sponsored" (used)
- High value for employers

**Inactive Clearance**
- Clearance was administratively closed at separation
- Not active, but may be reactivatable
- Easier to reactivate than obtain new
- Still valuable (6-12 months to reactivate vs. 18+ for new)

**No Clearance**
- You left without clearance or clearance expired
- Will need to obtain new clearance if required for job
- Takes 18+ months
- Employer typically pays for new clearance

## Step 2: Preserve Your Clearance Status

If you have active clearance, preserve it.

**To Keep Clearance Active:**

1. **Maintain Continuous Sponsorship**
   - Sponsor = employer using your clearance
   - Job at contractor with clearance requirement
   - Clearance stays active as long as you're employed in cleared position

2. **Transition Strategy**
   - Plan to move from military to cleared contractor job quickly
   - 6-month gap = clearance becomes "inactive but eligible"
   - 12+ month gap = clearance may lapse
   - Find cleared contractor job before separation (if possible)

3. **Update Security Forms If Required**
   - Some contractors require SF-86 update after separation
   - Provide updated personal information
   - Disclose any changes in financial, legal, or personal situation

### Timeline for Clearance Preservation

**Ideal Transition:**
- Month 12 (last year of service): Start applying for contractor jobs
- Month 6-11: Secure job offer (at cleared contractor)
- Month 1-2 (during terminal leave): Complete transition paperwork
- Day 1 of separation: Start civilian job with active clearance

**Reality (if gap exists):**
- If gap: 6 months = "inactive but eligible" (reactivation quicker)
- If gap: 12+ months = clearance may lapse (need reactivation or new clearance)

## FAQ: Security Clearances

**Q: How long does my clearance last?**
A: 5-10 years (depending on level and if continuously sponsored). Reinvestigation required every 5-10 years.

**Q: What happens if I don't use my clearance?**
A: After 2 years of non-use, clearance becomes "inactive." Can be reactivated but takes 6-12 months.
