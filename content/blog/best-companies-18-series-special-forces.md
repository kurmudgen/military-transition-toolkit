## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the highest-earning path for 18-Series veterans?**
A: Management consulting (McKinsey/BCG Partner: $500,000-$1,000,000+) or successful startup equity ($1,000,000+ post-IPO/acquisition). Best risk-adjusted path: Consulting to Principal level ($300,000-$500,000) within 5 years.

**Q: Do I need an MBA?**
A: Not required for entry but helpful for advancement. Consulting firms prefer military background over MBA for entry. MBA accelerates advancement to partner level (year 5-6 vs. 7-8).

**Q: Which company has best military culture?**
A: McKinsey, BCG, and Lockheed Martin have dedicated military programs. Amazon has strong ops culture. All value military leadership extensively.

**Q: What's the difference between consulting and tech for 18-Series?**
A: Consulting: Higher base pay initially ($170,000-$280,000), faster advancement to high income ($300,000+ year 3-4), premium partner compensation ($500,000+). Tech: Better work-life balance, more direct responsibility, higher equity upside at startups, clearer operational impact.

**Q: Can I get VC funding to start my own company?**
A: Yes, increasingly common. 18-Series background valued by VCs. Startup equity can exceed consulting partner income if successful ($1,000,000+ post-exit possible).

A: Consulting requires significant travel (50%+). Tech increasingly remote (40-60%). Startups variable. After 5+ years experience, remote opportunities increase significantly.

**Q: How important is security clearance?**
A: Valuable but not required for most civilian roles. Adds $10,000-$30,000 to government contractor positions. Less important for consulting, tech, and startups.

**Q: What's the typical career timeline to $200,000+?**
