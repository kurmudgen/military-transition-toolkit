## Certifications that actually matter for 2381s

Here's what's worth pursuing:

### Critical priority:

**Maintain your TS/SCI clearance** - Worth $30K-50K for IED exploitation contractor work. With active TS/SCI, you're immediately worth $140K-200K+ for overseas exploitation positions. Let it lapse and you lose high-paying opportunities. Value: Priceless for contractor work.

**Bachelor's degree** - Required for FBI TEDAC, ATF, IC positions, and increasingly preferred by contractors. Forensic science, chemistry, criminal justice, or intelligence studies work well for your background. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Value: Required for federal forensics and law enforcement; competitive advantage for contractors.

**Naval School EOD and 2381 qualification** - Your military qualifications are your primary credentials. Keep documentation of all EOD and EORE training. Value: Core qualification for all IED exploitation careers.

### High priority:

**Forensic certifications (if targeting civilian forensics)** - American Board of Criminalistics (ABC) certifications or International Association for Identification (IAI). Cost: $400-800. Value: Required or preferred for civilian forensic laboratory positions.

**HAZWOPER 40-hour** - Required for some post-blast investigation roles and evidence collection. Cost: $400-600. Time: 5 days. Value: Required for certain forensic and investigative positions.

**Master's degree (if targeting IC or senior positions)** - Forensic science, chemistry, intelligence studies, or security studies. Valuable for senior technical intelligence analyst roles (GS-13+) and laboratory management. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Value: Career advancement to senior positions; $15K-$25K salary impact.

### Medium priority:

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - For C-IED program management roles. Cost: $500-1,000. Value: Opens $150K-$200K+ program manager positions.

**Language certifications (DLPT)** - If you have foreign language skills (Arabic, Pashto, Dari, Urdu are high-demand for IED exploitation). Value: $5K-20K language proficiency pay for contractors; competitive advantage.

### Low priority:

**Additional EOD certifications** - Additional civilian EOD or explosives certifications. Research specific employer requirements.

**Photography certifications** - Evidence photography skills are valuable for forensics but not critical—usually trained on the job.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest about civilian exploitation versus military:

**Criminal forensics standards:** Military exploitation focuses on tactical/technical intelligence. Civilian forensics (FBI TEDAC, ATF, state labs) follows strict legal standards for evidence collection, chain of custody, and court admissibility. You'll learn this in FBI/ATF training or civilian forensic training.

**Expert testimony:** Civilian forensic examiners testify in criminal trials as expert witnesses. Military exploitation doesn't emphasize courtroom testimony. If pursuing forensics, you'll need strong communication skills and comfort testifying under cross-examination.

**Laboratory instrumentation:** Civilian forensic labs use analytical instruments (GC-MS, FTIR, SEM-EDS) for explosive residue analysis. Military exploitation is more field-focused. If targeting forensics, you may need additional laboratory training (covered in forensic positions).

**Criminal investigation:** FBI/ATF roles combine explosive forensics with criminal investigation. You'll need to learn investigative techniques, interview skills, and criminal law (covered in federal training).

**Networking in specialized field:** IED exploitation is a small, specialized community. Attend NDIA EOD Symposium, IABTI conferences, and forensic science conferences. Network with FBI TEDAC personnel, ATF post-blast investigators, and contractor exploitation specialists. Leverage your 2381 network.

**Business skills (for consulting):** If targeting consulting, you need business development, client relationship management, and proposal development skills. Take courses if needed.
