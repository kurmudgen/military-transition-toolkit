# Best Cities in South Carolina for Veterans 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Myrtle Beach ranks #1 for South Carolina veterans in 2025** according to Veterans United Home Loans—it's affordable (median home $300,000), has 28,000 veterans (8% of population), excellent quality of life with beaches and recreation, and proximity to Myrtle Beach VA Clinic. Charleston takes #2, offering world-class quality of life, strong economy, Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center on-site, and Joint Base Charleston employment—though housing is expensive at $410,000+ median.

For affordability, **Columbia** offers the best value: median home $220,000 (50% cheaper than Charleston), direct access to Dorn VA Medical Center, Fort Jackson civilian jobs, and South Carolina's capital city amenities. Greenville ranks #4 for veterans seeking Upstate mountain scenery, strong job market, and 7% below-national-average cost of living.

South Carolina's challenge is **rapidly rising housing costs** in desirable areas—Charleston jumped from $242,000 median (2020) to $410,000+ (2025). However, South Carolina offers massive tax advantages: **zero state tax on military retirement** (saves $2,000-$4,500/year) and **full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans** (saves $1,500-$4,000/year), substantially offsetting housing costs.

Overall, South Carolina cities excel for **quality of life** (warm climate, beaches, low crime in suburbs), **veteran employment** (1.7% unemployment—7th lowest nationally), and **military community** (large active-duty presence at Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson, Shaw AFB). Best for veterans prioritizing southern lifestyle, moderate cost of living, and excellent tax benefits.

## Tax Benefits Impact on Cost of Living

While housing costs are rising in South Carolina's desirable cities, **veteran tax benefits substantially offset costs:**

**Military Retirees (all ratings):**
- Zero state tax on military retirement (effective 2022): **Saves $2,000-$4,500/year**
- Example: O-5 retiree with $60,000 pension saves $3,990/year vs. pre-2022 SC (at 7% rate)

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Full property tax exemption on home + up to 5 acres: **Saves $1,400-$4,000/year depending on location**
- Vehicle exemption (2 vehicles): **Saves $1,000 one-time (sales tax) + $80-$120/year (registration)**

**Combined Benefits (100% Disabled Military Retiree):**
- Charleston ($410,000 home, $50,000 retirement): **$5,000+/year total savings**
- Columbia ($220,000 home, $50,000 retirement): **$4,500+/year total savings**
- Myrtle Beach ($300,000 home, $50,000 retirement): **$4,400+/year total savings**

Over 20 years, these tax savings total **$80,000-$100,000**—substantially offsetting higher housing costs in Charleston or coastal areas.
