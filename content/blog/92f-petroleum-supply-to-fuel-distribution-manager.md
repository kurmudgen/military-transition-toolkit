# 92F Petroleum Supply Specialist to Fuel Distribution Manager: Your Complete Transition Guide

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Army 92F Petroleum Supply Specialists transition successfully to civilian fuel distribution and energy sector management roles. Petroleum Distribution Managers earn a median salary of $98,280 annually (BLS), with 8% job growth through 2032. Your military experience in fuel logistics, inventory management, safety protocols, and multi-site supply coordination directly translates to high-value distribution management. Most 92Fs transition to civilian roles within 3-6 months, with potential to advance to regional management and executive positions earning $130,000-$200,000+ within 5-10 years. Industry demand remains strong, particularly in energy security and fuel supply chain optimization.

## Career Overview: From Military Petroleum to Civilian Energy Distribution

As a 92F Petroleum Supply Specialist, you've developed specialized expertise:

- Fuel storage and inventory management
- Multi-site logistics coordination
- Regulatory compliance and safety protocols (environmental/hazmat)
- Equipment operation and maintenance
- Fuel quality testing and documentation
- Supply forecasting and demand planning
- Environmental protection and spill response
- Military-to-civilian supply chain coordination
