## Bottom Line Up Front

11B Infantry gets labeled as "no civilian skills." That's complete garbage. You've got **leadership under pressure, weapons proficiency, physical fitness, attention to detail, and the ability to follow complex procedures**—skills that translate directly to law enforcement, security, corrections, and skilled trades. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$65,000**, with experienced professionals hitting **$85,000+** in protective services, federal law enforcement, or contractor work. You'll need some certs and maybe an associate's degree, but your military experience is the foundation.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 11B who starts researching civilian careers sees the same discouraging stuff: "Infantry doesn't translate." "You'll need to completely retrain." "Good luck with that resume."

Here's what that misses: **civilian HR doesn't understand what you actually did.**

You didn't just "carry a rifle." You:
- Led a fire team of 4-5 people in high-stress environments
- Maintained accountability for $200,000+ in weapons and equipment
- Executed complex missions with 15+ coordinated steps
- Adapted to changing situations in real-time
- Worked rotating shifts in all weather conditions
- Passed regular qualifications and standards
- Followed strict safety protocols

That's management, logistics, attention to detail, stress tolerance, and reliability. Those skills have value. You just need to translate them into language civilians understand, and target industries that actually need them.

## Best civilian career paths for 11B

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where 11Bs consistently land, with real salary data.

### Law enforcement (most common path)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Police officer
- Deputy sheriff
- State trooper
- Federal law enforcement (CBP, ICE, USMS, DEA)
- Game warden / conservation officer

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level municipal police:** $45,000-$55,000
- **State trooper:** $50,000-$65,000
- **Federal agent (GS-7 to GS-9 entry):** $52,000-$72,000
- **Experienced officer (5+ years):** $65,000-$85,000
- **Federal senior agent (GS-12+):** $85,000-$110,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Weapons handling and marksmanship
- High-stress decision making
- Following rules of engagement / use of force policies
- Report writing and documentation
- Shift work and irregular hours
- Physical fitness requirements

**Certifications needed:**
- **Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)** certification—required for most state/local police. Usually earned through police academy (4-6 months).
- **Driver's license** (clean record helps)
- **Associate's degree** increasingly preferred/required by competitive departments
- **Physical fitness test** (you'll smoke this)

**Reality check:**
The hiring process is slow. Background checks, psych evals, polygraph, medical screening—plan on 6-12 months from application to academy start. Some departments have mandatory waiting lists.

Military veteran preference applies for federal positions and many state/local departments, giving you serious advantage.

**Best for:** 11Bs who want structure, clear hierarchy, serve-your-community mission, and benefits similar to military.

### Private security and protective services

**Civilian job titles:**
- Armed security officer
- Security supervisor / operations manager
- Executive protection specialist
- Corporate security manager
- Loss prevention specialist

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level armed security:** $35,000-$45,000
- **Security supervisor:** $48,000-$60,000
- **Executive protection:** $55,000-$95,000
- **Corporate security manager:** $70,000-$90,000
- **High-end EP with overseas work:** $100,000-$150,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Weapons proficiency
- Situational awareness
- Patrol procedures
- Access control
- Emergency response
- Shift work tolerance

**Certifications needed:**
- **State security guard license** (requirements vary by state, usually $100-300 and a quick course)
- **Armed security certification** (additional firearms qualification)
- **Concealed carry permit** (for some EP roles)
- **First aid/CPR**
- **Executive protection training** (if going that route—companies like ESI, EPI offer courses)

**Reality check:**
Entry-level armed security pays less than you'd hope. It's a stepping stone. The real money is in executive protection (bodyguard work) for high-net-worth individuals or corporate security management.

If you go the EP route, you're looking at 60-80 hour weeks, constant travel, and being on-call. But six figures is reachable within 3-5 years if you build the right network.

**Best for:** 11Bs who want to work armed roles immediately without a long academy, or those willing to grind toward high-end EP work.

### Corrections and detention

**Civilian job titles:**
- Correctional officer
- Detention officer
- Juvenile corrections officer
- Federal Bureau of Prisons officer

**Salary ranges:**
- **State correctional officer:** $40,000-$52,000
- **Federal BOP (GS-5 to GS-6 entry):** $38,000-$47,000
- **Experienced officer:** $55,000-$70,000
- **Supervisory roles:** $70,000-$85,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Following strict procedures and protocols
- Maintaining accountability (headcounts, movement tracking)
- High-stress environment management
- De-escalation and communication
- Shift work
- Physical fitness and defensive tactics

**Certifications needed:**
- **State corrections training academy** (usually 6-12 weeks, often paid)
- **High school diploma** minimum (some prefer associate's)
- **Physical fitness and defensive tactics testing**

**Reality check:**
Corrections is hard work. You're managing inmates, not guarding a gate. Verbal abuse is constant, physical altercations happen, and the environment is stressful.

But: hiring is faster than police departments, veteran preference applies, federal BOP offers good benefits, and overtime opportunities can push your take-home income significantly higher.

A lot of 11Bs use corrections as a bridge job while waiting for police academy or building credentials for other careers.

**Best for:** 11Bs who need steady income quickly and can handle a high-stress environment while planning next steps.

### Skilled trades (underrated option)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Electrician
- HVAC technician
- Plumber
- Heavy equipment operator
- Lineman (electrical utility)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Apprentice (year 1-2):** $35,000-$45,000
- **Journeyman tradesman:** $55,000-$75,000
- **Master electrician / specialized trades:** $75,000-$95,000
- **Union lineman:** $80,000-$110,000+ (with OT)

**What translates directly:**
- Attention to detail and following procedures
- Physical fitness and manual labor tolerance
- Working in adverse conditions
- Tool accountability and maintenance
- Safety-first mindset

**Certifications needed:**
- **Trade-specific apprenticeship** (2-5 years depending on trade)
- **State licensing** (for electrician, plumber, HVAC in most states)
- **OSHA 10 or 30-hour safety certification**
- **CDL** (for some heavy equipment operator roles)

**Reality check:**
Trades require multi-year apprenticeships before you're making real money. But the path is clear, demand is high, and you can't outsource an electrician to India.

GI Bill can cover some apprenticeship programs. Unions often have veteran-friendly recruitment.

Long-term earning potential is strong—union lineman clearing $100K+ with overtime is common. And you're not sitting at a desk.

**Best for:** 11Bs who don't want an office job, like working with their hands, and are willing to put in 2-4 years of apprenticeship for a solid career.

### Private military contracting (PMC)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Security contractor (OCONUS)
- Static security specialist
- Personal security detail (PSD)
- Training instructor / advisor

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level overseas security:** $70,000-$90,000
- **PSD contractor:** $90,000-$130,000
- **High-threat environment contractor:** $120,000-$200,000+

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing a military-adjacent job.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Secret or Top Secret clearance** (massive advantage if you already have it)
- **High Threat Contractor training** (PSD course)
- **Advanced weapons and tactics certifications**
- **EMT or combat medic background** (helps but not required)
- **Previous deployment experience** (Iraq, Afghanistan)

**Reality check:**
Contracting is a young man's game. You're working 12+ hour days, 6-7 days a week, often in dangerous environments. But the money is real.

The work is cyclical based on contracts. You might work 6 months, then have 2 months off (unpaid). Not a long-term career for most, but a way to bank serious cash in your late 20s/early 30s.

Post-9/11, the contracting boom has slowed. Jobs still exist, but competition is higher and contracts are shorter.

**Best for:** Young 11Bs with recent deployments, clearances, and willingness to live overseas in high-threat areas for significant money.

### Federal government (non-law enforcement)

**Civilian job titles:**
- TSA officer
- Customs and Border Protection officer (non-agent roles)
- VA police officer
- Federal protective service officer
- DoD security specialist

**Salary ranges:**
- **TSA (GS-5 to GS-6):** $38,000-$47,000
- **CBP officer (GS-7 to GS-9):** $52,000-$72,000
- **Federal security roles (GS-7 to GS-11):** $52,000-$80,000

**What translates directly:**
- Security procedures
- Following federal regulations
- Attention to detail
- Customer service under stress

**Certifications needed:**
- **Federal background check and clearance** (standard)
- **Role-specific training** (provided on the job)

**Reality check:**
Federal jobs come with job security, benefits, and a clear GS pay scale with annual step increases. Veteran preference gets you 5-10 points in the hiring process.

The work isn't glamorous. TSA is checking bags. CBP officers are doing inspections. But it's stable, you get a pension, and you can promote over time.

**Best for:** 11Bs who want federal benefits and job security more than high pay or excitement.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "Infantry squad leader" on your resume. Civilians don't know what that means. Here's how to translate:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Fire team leader | Supervised team of 4-5 personnel in high-stress operations |
| Squad leader | Managed 9-person team; coordinated multi-step operations |
| Weapon maintenance | Maintained accountability for $200K+ equipment inventory |
| Conducted patrols | Executed security patrols and surveillance operations |
| Physical fitness standards | Met rigorous physical fitness requirements; maintained readiness |
| Qualified expert marksman | Weapons proficiency with pistol, rifle, and advanced systems |
| Shift work / guard duty | 24/7 operational availability; flexible schedule |
| Battle drills / SOPs | Executed complex procedures under pressure with zero margin for error |
| After-action reports | Documented operations and incidents in detailed written reports |

Use **active verbs**: Led, Managed, Coordinated, Executed, Maintained, Supervised.

Use **numbers**: "Led team of 9," "Managed $200K inventory," "Conducted 100+ security operations."

Drop the acronyms. No civilian knows what TTP, SOP, or METL means. Spell it out or rephrase it.

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill benefits:

### High priority (get these):

**Associate's degree in Criminal Justice** - Opens doors in law enforcement, corrections, probation. Many community colleges have veteran-friendly programs. Use your GI Bill. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Value: Required or preferred by most police departments.

**EMT certification** - Basic Emergency Medical Technician cert makes you more competitive in law enforcement, security contracting, and fire departments. Also a standalone career if you want it. Cost: $1,000-2,000 (covered by GI Bill at many programs). Time: 6 months part-time.

**State security guard / armed guard license** - Required to work armed security. Varies by state but usually a quick process. Cost: $100-500. Time: 1-2 weeks.

**POST / Police academy** - Required for law enforcement. Usually done after you're hired by a department (they pay for it). Time: 4-6 months.

### Medium priority (if it fits your path):

**Executive protection training** - If you're targeting high-end bodyguard work. Companies like ESI, EPI offer 1-2 week courses. Cost: $2,000-5,000. Value: Increases your marketability for EP roles.

**CDL (Commercial Driver's License)** - Opens up trucking, heavy equipment operation, and some security transport roles. Cost: $3,000-7,000 for training. Starting pay: $45K-55K. Demand is high.

**Trade apprenticeship** - Electrician, plumber, HVAC, lineman. Covered by GI Bill in many cases. Time: 2-5 years. Long-term value: High.

### Low priority (nice to have, not critical):

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - If you're trying to pivot to corporate project management. Requires 3 years experience. Cost: $500-3,000 for training + exam.

**Personal trainer certification** - If fitness is your thing and you want a side income or career pivot. Cost: $500-1,500. Income: $30K-50K unless you build a business.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest. There are civilian skills you don't have. Recognizing the gap is the first step.

**Computer skills:** If your computer experience is limited to looking at PowerPoints during briefs, you're behind. Most jobs require basic Microsoft Office, email, and data entry. Take a free online course. Learn Excel basics.

**Customer service / de-escalation:** Infantry trains you to be aggressive and assertive. Civilian jobs (especially law enforcement, security) require de-escalation and customer service. You'll need to adjust your communication style.

**Resume and interview skills:** Writing a resume and interviewing for civilian jobs is different. Use the [resume builder at Military Transition Toolkit](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com) to translate your military experience into civilian-friendly language.

**Patience with bureaucracy:** You think military paperwork is bad? Wait till you deal with civilian HR. The hiring process is slow. Background checks take months. Stay patient.

## Real 11B success stories

**Jake, 26, former 11B team leader → Police officer in Texas**

After 4 years and two deployments, Jake got out as an E-5. He used his GI Bill to get an associate's degree in criminal justice while working armed security part-time. Applied to 6 police departments, got 3 offers. Now makes $58,000 as a patrol officer, on track for $70K+ in 3 years.

**Marcus, 29, former 11B squad leader → Executive protection specialist**

Marcus did 6 years, got out as an E-6. Took a 2-week EP course, networked hard, and landed a job with a corporate security firm protecting executives. Started at $65K, now makes $95K after 3 years. Lots of travel, long hours, but he likes the work.

**David, 31, former 11B → Lineman (electrical utility)**

David wanted nothing to do with security or law enforcement. Got into an IBEW apprenticeship using his GI Bill. Took 4 years to get his journeyman card. Now makes $92K with overtime as a union lineman. Hard work, but great pay and job security.

## Bottom line for 11Bs

Your infantry experience isn't a dead-end. It's a foundation.

You've proven you can handle stress, lead people, stay disciplined, and execute complex tasks. Those skills matter in the civilian world—you just need to translate them, target the right industries, and get a few certifications to check the boxes.

Law enforcement, security, corrections, and skilled trades are proven paths. Thousands of 11Bs have done this before you. You're not starting from zero.

First-year income of $45K-65K is realistic. Within 5 years, $70K-85K+ is achievable if you stay focused and build your credentials.

Don't listen to the people who say infantry doesn't translate. They don't know what they're talking about.
