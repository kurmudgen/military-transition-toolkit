**CompTIA A+** - Basic IT support cert. Only get if you have zero IT background and need fundamentals. Cost: $246 per exam (2 exams). Most 0612s can skip this—you have more advanced skills.

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - If you want to move into project management after 3-5 years. Requires experience. Cost: $555 exam. Value: Opens PM roles ($85K-$110K).

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest. There are civilian skills you don't have. Recognizing the gap is the first step.

**Advanced IP networking:** You understand basic networking from military systems, but civilian roles require deeper TCP/IP knowledge, subnetting, VLANs, routing protocols. Solution: CompTIA Network+ or Cisco CCNA covers this. Study hard.

**Customer service communication:** Military communications work is mission-focused. Civilian work requires customer interaction, explaining technical issues to non-technical people, managing expectations. You'll need to adjust your communication style. Practice translating tech-speak into plain language.

**Enterprise VoIP systems:** You worked with tactical systems. Civilians use enterprise platforms—Cisco Unified Communications, Avaya, Microsoft Teams, Ring Central. Platforms differ but concepts are similar. Many employers provide training.

**Documentation in civilian formats:** Military technical documentation is formatted differently than civilian work orders, service tickets, and project documentation. You'll adapt quickly, but expect a learning curve.

**Vendor-specific tools:** Each manufacturer has proprietary tools, testing equipment, and software. You'll need on-the-job training for specific platforms. Your general technical aptitude matters more than specific tool knowledge.

**Less structure:** Civilian jobs have less rigid hierarchy and procedures than military. You'll have more autonomy but also less clearly defined processes. Some 0612s struggle with ambiguity—work on being more adaptable.
