### 7. Which city is best for military families with school-age children?

Appleton and Waukesha have excellent public schools. Madison also has strong schools but higher costs. Green Bay offers good schools at moderate prices.

### 8. Can I live anywhere in Wisconsin and use the Wisconsin GI Bill?

Yes, as long as you maintain Wisconsin residency and attend a UW System or Wisconsin Technical College school. You can live in any city.

### 9. Which city has the worst winters?

All Wisconsin cities have cold winters. Eau Claire and northern cities (Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh) typically get more snow. Milwaukee's lakefront location moderates temperatures slightly.

### 10. Is Madison too liberal for conservative veterans?

Madison is Wisconsin's most progressive city (university town, state capital, highly educated population). If politics matter to you, consider Green Bay, Appleton, or Waukesha (more conservative).

### 11. Is Milwaukee safe?

Safety varies dramatically by neighborhood. Safe areas: East Side, Bay View, Wauwatosa, Shorewood. Avoid North Side and some South Side areas. Research specific neighborhoods carefully.

### 12. Which city is best for manufacturing jobs?
