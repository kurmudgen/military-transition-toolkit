# How to Start a Business as a Veteran: Complete Entrepreneur Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Veterans have excellent conditions for entrepreneurship: strong leadership skills, discipline, access to capital through VA programs, and preferred contracting status. However, 90% of veteran businesses fail in first 5 years because they skip critical planning steps. This guide walks you through business planning, accessing veteran-specific funding and support, and executing your business launch systematically.

## Why Veterans Make Great Entrepreneurs

**Veteran Advantages:**
- Leadership and management experience
- Crisis decision-making skills
- Ability to manage complex operations
- Discipline and work ethic
- Access to VA small business programs and funding
- Preferred vendor status in government contracting
- Veterans business loans with favorable terms
- VOSB (Veteran-Owned Small Business) certifications

**Why Veterans Struggle:**
- Skip strategic planning
- Undercapitalize business
- Try to do everything themselves
- Don't leverage veteran business resources
- Don't apply for government contracts (big opportunity)
- Lack civilian business experience/knowledge
- Don't seek mentorship or advisors

## Step 1: Validate Business Idea (Weeks 1-2)

Before quitting your job, validate your business idea.

**Validation Process:**

### Step 1A: Define Your Business Concept

Answer these questions:

1. **What problem does your business solve?**
   - Specific problem
   - Who has this problem (target customer)
   - How big is the market for this problem

2. **What's your solution?**
   - Product or service
   - Why you're uniquely qualified (veteran advantage?)
   - Competitive advantage vs. competitors

3. **Who's your customer?**
   - Target customer profile
   - Where do they buy this solution today
   - Why would they buy from you

4. **What's your pricing model?**
   - What will you charge
   - How does this compare to competitors
   - Is pricing profitable

### Step 1B: Research the Market

Don't rely on hunches. Research your market.

**Market Research Checklist:**

- [ ] Identify 5-10 competitors (existing businesses solving same problem)
- [ ] Analyze competitor pricing, positioning, and marketing
- [ ] Survey 20+ potential customers on problem importance
- [ ] Research market size (total addressable market)
- [ ] Check if market is growing, stable, or declining
- [ ] Identify industry trends affecting your business
- [ ] Research regulations/licensing requirements

**Question 20 Potential Customers:**
- "Do you have this problem?" (Yes/No)
- "How often do you need this solution?" (Frequency)
- "What do you currently do to solve this?" (Current solution)
- "What would you pay for a better solution?" (Price validation)
- "Would you buy from me?" (Basic commitment)

### Step 1C: Calculate Basic Economics

Create simple math to see if business is viable.

**Example: Veteran-Owned Consulting Business**

| Factor | Calculation | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Service: Project management consulting | | |
| Hourly rate | $150/hour | $150 |
| Billable hours per month | 160 hours | 160 |
| Monthly revenue | 160 × $150 | $24,000 |
| Annual revenue | $24,000 × 12 | $288,000 |
| | | |
| Operating costs per month | | |
| Office/Software/Insurance | $2,000 | $2,000 |
| Marketing/Sales | $1,000 | $1,000 |
| Admin/Overhead | $500 | $500 |
| Total monthly costs | | $3,500 |
| | | |
| Monthly profit (revenue - costs) | $24,000 - $3,500 | $20,500 |
| Annual profit | $20,500 × 12 | $246,000 |
| Net profit margin | $246,000 / $288,000 | 85% |

**Question:** Can you realistically achieve 160 billable hours/month starting year 1? If yes, business is viable. If no, reduce assumptions or reconsider.

## Step 2: Create Simple Business Plan (Weeks 2-4)

Veterans often skip business planning because it feels like military planning (tedious). But business planning is just strategic thinking on paper.
