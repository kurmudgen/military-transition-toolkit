## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 35T Military Intelligence Systems Maintainer/Integrators transitioning out—your combination of intelligence systems expertise, IT skills, and security clearance makes you valuable across government and private sector IT fields. Your **intelligence systems maintenance and troubleshooting, network administration, systems integration, classified systems security, hardware/software installation and configuration, and ability to maintain mission-critical intelligence systems** translate directly to civilian IT careers. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$75,000-$100,000** with defense contractors or entry-level IT positions, scaling to **$100,000-$135,000** with mid-career systems administration or cybersecurity roles, and **$135,000-$165,000+** for senior IT engineering or security positions. Your TS/SCI clearance with technical IT skills is worth **$20,000-$35,000** in salary premium.

As a 35T, you didn't just "fix computers." You maintained, troubleshooted, and integrated sophisticated intelligence systems including DCGS-A, TROJAN, Prophet, and other classified intelligence platforms. You administered networks, configured servers, installed and maintained hardware and software, performed systems security operations, troubleshot complex technical problems under operational pressure, and ensured mission-critical intelligence systems remained operational 24/7. That's systems administration, network engineering, cybersecurity, technical troubleshooting, and IT project management—all highly marketable civilian IT skills.

The key advantage: Your cleared IT experience with mission-critical intelligence systems demonstrates both technical competence and trustworthiness. Defense contractors supporting intelligence systems need your expertise. Federal agencies need cleared IT professionals. Private sector companies value your systematic troubleshooting and mission-focused mindset. You've kept intelligence systems running in combat zones and high-tempo operational environments—that's the hardest IT support there is.

## What Does a 35T MI Systems Maintainer/Integrator Do?

As a 35T, you maintained, operated, integrated, and troubleshot military intelligence systems and networks. You performed installation, configuration, and maintenance of intelligence hardware and software including servers, workstations, networking equipment, and specialized intelligence platforms (DCGS-A, TROJAN, Prophet, GUARDRAIL, etc.). You administered classified networks, managed user accounts and permissions, implemented security protocols, and maintained systems security. You troubleshot complex technical problems including hardware failures, software conflicts, network connectivity issues, and system performance problems. You integrated new systems and equipment, performed software updates and patches, and conducted preventive maintenance.

Your responsibilities included maintaining accountability and security of intelligence systems and equipment, performing systems backups and recovery operations, documenting technical procedures and maintenance actions, training users on intelligence systems operations, supporting deployed intelligence operations often in austere environments, and ensuring 24/7 availability of mission-critical intelligence systems. You worked with TOP SECRET/SCI materials and maintained strict security protocols.

This role required technical proficiency with computer hardware and software, networking knowledge, troubleshooting and problem-solving skills, attention to detail, ability to work under pressure, understanding of information security principles, documentation skills, and TS/SCI clearance to work on classified intelligence systems.
