## Bottom Line Up Front

Transitioning from military to civilian life isn't something you figure out in your last 30 days. **Start 12 months out**, hit the mandatory appointments (TAP/ACAP/TAMP, VA claim, medical records review), and document everything. The difference between a smooth transition and a chaotic scramble is a timeline. This guide breaks down exactly what to do at 12 months, 6 months, 3 months, and 30 days before your ETS/retirement date. **Miss critical deadlines (like VA claims or GI Bill applications), and you're leaving money on the table.**

## Why you need a transition checklist

Here's the problem: the military gives you a separation briefing, hands you a binder full of forms, and says "good luck."

That binder sits on your desk. You're busy with your actual job. Then suddenly you're 60 days out and panicking.

The E-7s and E-8s who nail their transition? They started early. They treated it like a deployment—timelines, checklists, rehearsals.

The ones who struggle? They winged it.

Don't wing it. Here's your timeline.

## 12 months before separation: Setup and assessment

At the 12-month mark, you're starting to shift your focus from "what's my next duty station" to "what's my next career."

### Register for TAP (Transition Assistance Program)

Every branch calls it something slightly different (Army: ACAP / SFL-TAP, Navy: TGPS, Air Force: TAP, Marines: TAMP), but it's the same thing: **mandatory transition training**.

You're required to attend TAP within 12 months of separation. Schedule it now, not later.

**What TAP covers:**
- Resume writing
- Interview skills
- VA benefits overview
- Career exploration
- Financial planning

**Reality check:** TAP quality varies wildly by base. Some programs are excellent. Some are PowerPoint hell presented by contractors who've never served. Attend anyway. It's mandatory, and you might learn something useful.

**Pro tip:** If your base has a crappy TAP program, look for online resources or veteran organizations (Hiring Our Heroes, American Corporate Partners) that offer better career transition support.

### Start your VA disability claim research

You don't file your VA claim at 12 months, but you start **documenting your conditions now**.

**Actions:**
- **List every injury, condition, or issue** you've had during your service. Back pain? Tinnitus? Knee problems? PTSD? Sleep issues? Write it all down.
- **Check your medical records.** Are your conditions documented? If not, get seen NOW.
- **Get a baseline hearing test** if you haven't had one recently (crucial for tinnitus claims).
- **Talk to veterans who've filed claims** to understand what to expect.

The VA claims process takes **3-6 months minimum**, and longer if they need additional evidence. Starting your research at 12 months gives you time to build your case.

**Common mistake:** Assuming "I feel fine, I don't need VA disability." Even if you're not hurting now, conditions worsen over time. Tinnitus, hearing loss, joint pain, sleep apnea—these are degenerative. File for everything you're entitled to.

### Assess your finances

**Actions:**
- **Calculate your separation/retirement pay.** Know exactly what you're getting and when.
- **Build a 3-6 month emergency fund** if you don't have one. Unemployment might not kick in immediately, and job hunts can take longer than expected.
- **Review your TSP** (Thrift Savings Plan). Decide if you're rolling it into a civilian 401(k) or IRA, or leaving it in TSP.
- **Check your credit score.** You'll need good credit for renting apartments, car loans, etc.

**Reality check:** You're about to lose steady paychecks, free healthcare, and housing allowance. Get your financial house in order now, not when you're unemployed in 6 months.

### Research career paths

**Actions:**
- **Identify 3-5 civilian careers** that match your military skills.
- **Research salary ranges** for those careers in your target city (use Glassdoor, Indeed, Salary.com).
- **Look at job postings** to see what qualifications employers want.
- **Connect with veterans** who've transitioned into those careers (LinkedIn is great for this).

Use the [career planning tools at Military Transition Toolkit](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com) to translate your military experience into civilian job titles and explore career options.

### Update personal documents

**Actions:**
- **Get a copy of your DD-214** (you'll get the official one at out-processing, but request a copy early if possible).
- **Update your driver's license** if needed.
- **Get a passport** if you don't have one (some jobs require it, plus it's easier to get while you're still employed).

## 6 months before separation: Applications and certifications

At 6 months, you're shifting from research mode to action mode.

### File your VA disability claim (BDD)

This is **critical**. The **Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)** program lets you file your VA claim **60-180 days before separation**.

**Why BDD matters:**
- You get your VA rating **within 30-60 days of separation** (instead of waiting 6-12 months).
- Faster rating = faster disability payments.
- You can schedule C&P (compensation and pension) exams while still on active duty.

**How to file BDD:**
1. **Go to eBenefits or VA.gov** and start your claim.
2. **Upload supporting documents:** medical records, service treatment records, buddy statements, private medical records.
3. **Attend your C&P exams** (VA will schedule them).
4. **Follow up** to ensure nothing's missing.

**Common mistake:** Waiting until after you ETS to file. You'll wait months for a decision. File BDD at 90-120 days out.

### Apply for GI Bill / education benefits

If you're planning to use your **Post-9/11 GI Bill**, apply now.

**Actions:**
- **Go to VA.gov** and apply for education benefits (VA Form 22-1990).
- **Get your Certificate of Eligibility (COE).**
- **Research schools or certification programs** you want to attend.
- **Apply to schools** (some schools have rolling admissions, but many have deadlines).

**Reality check:** The GI Bill covers tuition, housing allowance, and books. It's worth over **$100,000** in benefits. Don't leave it on the table.

You can also use GI Bill for:
- Vocational/technical training
- Apprenticeships
- Certifications (IT certs, CDL, etc.)
- Flight school

If you've got dependents, consider **transferring your GI Bill** to your spouse or kids (you need to have at least 6 years in service and commit to 4 more years to transfer it—so this needs to be done before separation if you haven't already).

### Get civilian certifications

Depending on your career path, now's the time to knock out certifications.

**Examples:**
- **IT (25B):** Security+, Network+, CCNA
- **Medical (68W):** EMT-B, paramedic cert
- **Mechanic:** ASE certifications
- **Truck driver:** CDL
- **Project management:** PMP, CASP

Many of these are covered by **SkillBridge** or **credentialing programs** through your branch. Look into:
- **Army Credentialing Assistance (CA)**
- **Navy COOL (Credentialing Opportunities On-Line)**
- **Air Force AFVEC**
- **Marine Corps COOL**

These programs can pay for certifications while you're still on active duty. Use them.

### Research SkillBridge programs

**SkillBridge** is a DoD program that lets you do civilian internships or training during your last 6 months of service (180 days max).

You stay on active duty (getting paid, keeping benefits), but you work for a civilian company gaining experience.

**How it works:**
- You find a SkillBridge-approved company or program (list at SkillBridge.osd.mil).
- You apply and get accepted.
- Your command approves your participation.
- You spend your last 90-180 days interning at the company (many get hired afterward).

**Reality check:** SkillBridge is competitive. Apply early. Popular programs (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, defense contractors) fill up fast.

**Common mistake:** Not knowing SkillBridge exists. It's one of the best programs for transitioning service members, but a lot of people miss it because their command doesn't advertise it.

### Start applying for jobs

Yes, **6 months out**. The civilian hiring process is slow.

**Actions:**
- **Update your resume** to civilian format (no military jargon).
- **Set up LinkedIn profile** (professional photo, detailed experience, certifications).
- **Start applying** to jobs (aim for 10-15 applications per week).
- **Network** with veterans in your target industry (LinkedIn, veteran Facebook groups, in-person events).

**Realistic timeline:**
- Application to first interview: 2-4 weeks
- Interview to offer: 2-6 weeks
- Offer to start date: 2-4 weeks

Total: **6-14 weeks**. If you start applying at 6 months out, you might have a job offer by 3 months out, with a start date right after separation.

### Attend medical appointments

**Actions:**
- **Get a full medical exam** and document everything.
- **Dental check** (get all work done now while it's free).
- **Vision exam** (get glasses/contacts if needed).
- **Mental health screening** if you've got PTSD, anxiety, or depression symptoms (this needs to be in your records for VA claims).

**Common mistake:** Not getting stuff documented. If it's not in your medical records, the VA will fight you on it. Get. Everything. Documented.

## 3 months before separation: Final preparations

At 3 months, you're in the final stretch. Time to lock down the details.

### Finalize your VA claim

If you filed BDD at 6 months, you should have:
- Completed your C&P exams
- Submitted all supporting documents
- Received a decision (or have one pending)

**Follow up** on your claim. Check eBenefits or VA.gov for status updates. If something's missing, submit it ASAP.

### Secure housing

**Actions:**
- **Decide where you're moving.** Job lined up? Move there. No job yet? Move somewhere with a strong job market and lower cost of living.
- **Research housing costs** (rent/mortgage, utilities).
- **Start looking for apartments or houses.**
- **Budget for moving costs** (truck rental, movers, deposits, etc.).

**Reality check:** If you're leaving base housing, plan for:
- **Security deposit** (usually 1 month's rent)
- **First month's rent**
- **Utility deposits**

That's easily **$3,000-5,000** upfront. Have it saved.

### Plan your healthcare transition

Once you ETS, you lose Tricare (unless you're retiring).

**Options:**
- **VA healthcare** (enroll at VA.gov; free or low-cost depending on your VA rating)
- **Tricare Retired Reserve** (if you're in reserves)
- **Civilian employer insurance** (if you land a job with benefits)
- **ACA marketplace** (healthcare.gov if you're between jobs)
- **CHCBP (Continued Health Care Benefit Program)** - temporary coverage for 18-36 months (you pay premium)

**Enroll in VA healthcare** even if you have other insurance. It's a backup, and if you're rated 50%+ disabled, it's free.

### Review terminal leave

**Terminal leave** = using your accrued leave at the end of your contract so you get out early but still get paid.

**Example:** Your ETS is June 30. You have 60 days of leave. You take terminal leave starting May 1. You're done with work on May 1, but you're still getting paid through June 30.

**Actions:**
- **Calculate your leave balance.**
- **Submit terminal leave request** (work with your command).
- **Plan your actual move** during terminal leave.

**Reality check:** Some commands don't like terminal leave and will pressure you to use-or-lose it or sell it back. Know your rights. You're entitled to terminal leave if you want it.

### Complete mandatory out-processing appointments

Every base has slightly different out-processing, but expect:

- **Final medical exam**
- **Finance (final pay, travel vouchers, etc.)**
- **Personnel (DD-214 review)**
- **CIF/supply turn-in** (TA-50, gear, weapons, etc.)
- **Housing (clear quarters if in base housing)**
- **TMO/Transportation** (arrange move)
- **ID card turn-in** (you'll get a veteran ID card or dependent ID if retiring)

**Pro tip:** Start this checklist early. Some appointments take weeks to schedule. Don't wait until your last week.

### Prep your resume and portfolio

**Actions:**
- **Finalize your civilian resume** (get it reviewed by a professional or use our [resume builder](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com)).
- **Prepare interview answers** (practice common questions, prepare STAR-method responses).
- **Build a portfolio** if relevant (IT folks: GitHub with projects; mechanics: photos of work; etc.).

## 30 days before separation: Final out-processing

You're in the final month. Time to close out.

### Confirm your DD-214 accuracy

Your **DD-214** is the most important document you'll get. It's proof of service, and you'll need it for:
- VA benefits
- Veteran hiring preference
- Education benefits
- VA home loans
- Veteran discounts

**Check for errors:**
- Dates of service
- Character of discharge (honorable, general, etc.)
- Awards and decorations
- Reenlistment eligibility code (RE code)

**Common mistake:** Not reviewing your DD-214 before signing. Once you sign, corrections are a bureaucratic nightmare. Review it line-by-line.

**Get multiple copies** (10+ certified copies). You'll need them.

### Finalize job offers / income plan

Ideally, you've got a job offer by now. If not, have a plan:
- **Unemployment benefits** (you're eligible in most states)
- **Spouse income** (if applicable)
- **Savings** (emergency fund)
- **Temp work or gig jobs** (Uber, DoorDash, etc.) to cover gaps

**Don't panic if you don't have a job yet.** The average job search takes 3-6 months. You've got savings, VA disability (if rated), and unemployment to bridge the gap.

### Set up veteran benefits

**Actions:**
- **Register for VA healthcare** (if you haven't already).
- **Apply for veteran ID card** (Vets.gov).
- **Sign up for VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility** (if buying a house).
- **Check state veteran benefits** (property tax exemptions, education waivers, etc.).

### Transfer/close accounts

**Actions:**
- **TSP:** Decide if you're leaving it in TSP or rolling it to an IRA/401(k).
- **Bank accounts:** If you're using a military-only bank (like Navy Federal or USAA), decide if you're keeping it or switching.
- **SGLI (Servicemembers Group Life Insurance):** Decide if you're converting to VGLI (Veterans Group Life Insurance) or getting civilian life insurance.

**SGLI to VGLI:** You have 1 year and 120 days after separation to convert SGLI to VGLI without a medical exam. Don't sleep on this if you've got health issues—civilian life insurance will be more expensive or deny you.

### Final gear turn-in and clearing

**Actions:**
- **Turn in all gear** (CIF, TA-50, etc.). **Do not lose anything.** Lost gear = statement of charges = money out of your pocket.
- **Clear all on-base accounts** (library, gym, etc.).
- **Final finance check** (make sure you're not overpaid; overpayments will be collected).

### Say your goodbyes

Look, this part's harder than people admit. You've spent years with these people. You've deployed together. You've done stupid details and drunk at the same bars.

Transition is exciting, but it's also a loss. Take time to say goodbye.

Get contact info. Stay in touch. The military community is smaller than you think.

## Common mistakes to avoid

### Mistake #1: Starting too late

If you start thinking about transition 60 days before ETS, you're in panic mode. Start at 12 months.

### Mistake #2: Not filing VA disability

Even if you feel fine, file. Tinnitus, hearing loss, joint pain, sleep apnea—these get worse with age. File now.

### Mistake #3: Skipping TAP

It's mandatory for a reason. Go. Pay attention. Network with other transitioning service members.

### Mistake #4: Not saving money

Your first few months out are expensive. Moving costs, deposits, gap between paychecks. Have 3-6 months of expenses saved.

### Mistake #5: Accepting the first job offer without negotiating

You've got valuable skills. Negotiate salary. Ask for $5K-10K more. Worst they say is no.

### Mistake #6: Forgetting to document everything

Medical issues, awards, training—if it's not in your records, it doesn't exist. Get everything documented before you ETS.

### Mistake #7: Not using SkillBridge

Free civilian job training while still getting paid? Yes please. Look into it at 6 months out.

## Branch-specific notes
