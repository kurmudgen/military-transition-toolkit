## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 68V Respiratory Specialists—you're stepping into one of healthcare's fastest-growing and highest-paying allied health careers. Your **advanced airway management, mechanical ventilation experience, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary function testing, critical care expertise, and ability to manage life-threatening respiratory emergencies** make you exceptionally qualified for civilian respiratory therapy positions. Realistic first-year salaries as a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) range from **$61,900-$75,000** for entry-level positions, scaling to **$75,000-$95,000** with 3-5 years experience, and reaching **$85,000-$108,820+** for senior respiratory therapists, specialists, or those in management roles. Travel respiratory therapists can earn **$85,000-$120,000+** on contract assignments.

The respiratory therapy field projects **12% job growth from 2024 to 2034**—much faster than average for all occupations—with approximately 139,600 jobs nationwide and growing demand driven by aging populations, increased chronic respiratory diseases, and expanding critical care capabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of respiratory therapists, leading to expanded roles, increased salaries, and greater professional recognition. You're entering a profession with excellent job security, competitive pay, and meaningful clinical impact.

Your military training already covers 70-80% of civilian respiratory therapy competencies. You've managed ventilators in combat hospitals, performed emergency airway interventions, analyzed blood gases, administered respiratory medications, and treated everything from traumatic lung injuries to ARDS. What you need is the **credential**—Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) certification through the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC)—and you're employable immediately. Most 68V transitions complete the credential pathway within 6-12 months and start earning $70,000-$85,000 within their first year.

## What Does a 68V Respiratory Specialist Do?

Army 68V Respiratory Specialists provide specialized respiratory care across the full spectrum of military medical operations. You performed diagnostic testing including pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, and bronchoscopy assistance. You managed mechanical ventilators for patients from neonates to adults, adjusting settings based on patient condition and physician orders. You administered respiratory medications via nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, and endotracheal tube. You conducted airway clearance therapy, oxygen therapy management, and emergency airway interventions. You assisted with advanced procedures including intubation, extubation, and bronchoscopy. You educated patients on respiratory conditions, proper inhaler technique, and home oxygen use.

Your 68V training at Fort Sam Houston Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) lasted 35 weeks—among the longest AIT programs in the Army—covering anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology of cardiopulmonary disease, pharmacology, radiography interpretation, mechanical ventilation, arterial blood gas interpretation, pulmonary function testing, and critical care respiratory management. This exceeds many civilian respiratory therapy associate degree programs in clinical depth, particularly in critical care and trauma management.

The critical difference between you and civilian respiratory therapy students: You managed real patients with life-threatening conditions in high-acuity military treatment facilities and combat support hospitals. You made ventilator adjustments on critically ill patients, responded to respiratory emergencies including rapid response and code blue situations, and managed airways under pressure. That clinical experience gives you a massive advantage over new civilian respiratory therapy graduates who may have limited hands-on critical care exposure during training.

## Skills You've Developed (Military to Civilian Translation)

### Technical Respiratory Skills

## Transition Timeline: Your 12-Month Roadmap

### Months 1-3: Credentialing Foundation

**Week 1-2**:
- Research NBRC certification requirements at NBRC.org
- Request official military training transcripts from Army (AARTS transcript)
- Gather all 68V training certificates and documentation
- Join AARC (American Association for Respiratory Care) for $89/year student rate
- Connect with 10-20 former 68Vs on LinkedIn who transitioned to civilian respiratory therapy

**Week 3-4**:
- Purchase NBRC study materials (Egan's Fundamentals, Kettering review books)
- Take NBRC self-assessment exam ($50-$125) to identify knowledge gaps
- Create study schedule for TMC (CRT) exam - plan 2-4 months preparation
- Research state respiratory therapy licensure requirements for your target location

**Month 2-3**:
- Study 10-15 hours/week for TMC exam
- Consider Kettering National Seminars review course ($600-$1,200) - many 68Vs find this helpful
- Schedule TMC exam through NBRC for Month 4
- Apply for BLS certification course (take within next 30 days)
- Begin applying for "Respiratory Therapist" positions that accept "RRT eligible" or "RRT pending" candidates

### Months 4-6: Certification and Initial Employment

**Month 4**:
- Take TMC (CRT) examination ($200)
- If pass at high-cut score: Immediately eligible for RRT (CSE) exam
- If pass at low-cut score: Granted CRT credential, eligible for RRT after clinical experience or program completion
- Most 68Vs pass at high-cut score due to extensive military clinical experience

**Month 5**:
- Schedule CSE (RRT) examination through NBRC ($365)
- Study for clinical simulation exam (2-4 weeks preparation)
- Continue applying to respiratory therapist positions - mention "RRT exam scheduled [date]"
- Take ACLS course ($250-$350) while waiting for RRT exam date

**Month 6**:
- Take CSE (RRT) examination
- Receive RRT credential (typically within 2-4 weeks)
- Apply for state respiratory therapy license ($100-$300)
- Apply to 20-30 respiratory therapist positions nationwide
- Consider travel staffing agencies if open to relocation

### Months 7-12: Employment and Career Launch

**Month 7-8**:
- Accept respiratory therapist position (typical starting salary $65,000-$80,000)
- Begin hospital orientation (1-4 weeks)
- Complete facility-specific competencies on equipment
- Shadow experienced respiratory therapists in ICU, ER, and floors
- Join state respiratory care society ($25-$75/year)

**Month 9-12**:
- Complete probationary period (typically 90 days)
- Build civilian clinical experience
- Take specialty certification if applicable (PALS for NICU, NRP for neonates)
- Network with respiratory therapy colleagues
- Identify specialty interest (ICU, NICU, transport, pulmonary rehab)
- Plan for specialty credential (ACCS, NPS) in 12-24 months

**Month 12 Assessment**:
- Employed as RRT earning $65,000-$85,000
- RRT certification complete
- State licensure active
- BLS, ACLS certifications current
- Building civilian references and experience
- Positioned for specialty advancement or travel positions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long to Get RRT Certification**
The problem: Some 68Vs work as uncertified respiratory therapy techs or delay certification, losing earning potential.
The fix: Prioritize RRT certification immediately. The salary difference between respiratory therapy tech ($35,000-$45,000) and RRT ($65,000-$85,000) is $20,000-$40,000 annually. Get certified within first 6 months.

**Mistake 2: Not Leveraging Military Clinical Experience**
The problem: Underselling your 68V experience on resumes and applications.
The fix: You managed ventilators in combat support hospitals, treated trauma patients, and performed procedures civilian new grads never see. Emphasize this extensively in applications and interviews.

**Mistake 3: Limiting Job Search to One Geographic Area**
The problem: Only applying locally when better opportunities exist elsewhere.
The fix: Respiratory therapist jobs exist nationwide. Be flexible on location, especially initially. Work 1-2 years to build experience, then relocate to desired area.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Travel Opportunities**
The problem: Only pursuing permanent positions when travel pays $20,000-$40,000 more annually.
The fix: After 1-2 years civilian experience, consider travel respiratory therapy. Earn more, try different locations and specialties, then settle in preferred area.

**Mistake 5: Not Using Veterans Preference**
The problem: Not claiming veterans hiring advantage for VA and federal positions.
The fix: VA hospitals actively hire veteran respiratory therapists. You get veterans preference, federal benefits, and job security. Apply to VA medical centers nationwide.
