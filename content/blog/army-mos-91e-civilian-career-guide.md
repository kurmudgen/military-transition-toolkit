## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 91E Allied Trades Specialists transitioning out—you're not just a welder or machinist, you're a **multi-skilled craftsman with welding, machining, fabrication, metalworking, blueprint reading, precision measurement, and problem-solving abilities across multiple skilled trades**. Your hands-on experience fabricating, repairing, and modifying metallic and non-metallic parts for military equipment translates directly to some of the highest-paying blue-collar careers in America. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$52,000-$65,000** for entry-level welder-fabricators or machinists at manufacturing facilities, scaling to **$75,000-$90,000+** with AWS certifications and 3-5 years experience in specialized welding or precision machining. Top-tier certified welders in oil and gas, aerospace, or union construction, plus master machinists, can earn **$90,000-$120,000+**. You've got multi-trade skills that are in extreme demand—deploy them strategically.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 91E separating hears the same thing: "But welding and machining are dying trades being replaced by automation."

Here's the reality: **Skilled welders and machinists are in SEVERE shortage. The American Welding Society projects 330,000 new welding professionals needed by 2028, with 82,500 jobs to fill annually. CNC machinists have similar shortages. Automation doesn't replace skilled trades—it creates demand for people who can program, operate, and maintain advanced equipment.**

You didn't just "weld stuff." You:
- Performed MIG, TIG, stick, and flux-core welding on various metals and alloys
- Fabricated components from blueprints and technical drawings
- Operated lathes, milling machines, drill presses, and grinders
- Programmed and operated CNC (computer numerical control) machines
- Performed precision measurements using micrometers, calipers, and gauges
- Read and interpreted complex technical drawings and specifications
- Welded and fabricated repairs on damaged military equipment
- Modified parts and created custom components for unique applications
- Performed heat treating, grinding, and finishing operations

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest about civilian skills you don't have:

**Advanced CNC programming:** Military machining may have been primarily manual or basic CNC. Civilian manufacturing uses sophisticated multi-axis CNC with CAM software (Mastercam, Fusion 360, etc.). Expect 6-12 month learning curve for advanced programming.

**Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T):** Aerospace and precision manufacturing use GD&T extensively on blueprints. If your military training didn't emphasize GD&T, take courses—it's critical for quality machining.

**Welding codes and standards:** Civilian welding follows AWS codes (D1.1, D1.6, etc.), ASME codes (pressure vessels), or API codes (oil & gas). Military welding may not have followed these civilian standards. Get AWS certified to learn proper codes.

**Quality management systems:** Aerospace uses AS9100, automotive uses IATF 16949, general manufacturing uses ISO 9001. You'll need to learn documentation, traceability, and quality procedures—more bureaucratic than military maintenance.

**Business operations (if going independent):** Mobile welding or small machining businesses require licensing, liability insurance (critical—weld failures can be catastrophic), invoicing, marketing, and tax planning. Many 91Es have technical skills but struggle with business side.
