**Q: How difficult is OSCP?**
A: OSCP is challenging, estimated 40-50% failure rate. Your 94F background gives significant advantage. Expect 300-500 intensive hours of study/lab work.

**Q: Can I transition to penetration testing without CEH?**
A: Some companies hire based on experience and skills testing, but CEH or OSCP significantly improves hiring chances and starting salary.

**Q: Which is better: CEH or OSCP?**
A: OSCP is harder, more respected, higher earning potential. CEH is faster, still valuable for employment. Many pursue both sequentially.

**Q: How much do penetration testing consultants earn?**
A: Independent penetration testers charge $150-$300/hour ($300,000-$600,000 annually for full-time consulting). Requires client acquisition skills and business acumen.

**Q: Will federal contractors pay for my certifications?**
A: Yes, most federal contractors reimburse Security+, CEH, and OSCP ($1,000-$5,000 per certification). Many provide study time.

**Q: What's the career ceiling for penetration testers?**
A: Senior penetration tester: $200,000. Consulting: $300,000-$500,000+. Principal security engineer: $200,000-$350,000+. Director/CISO: $250,000-$500,000+.

**Q: Should I pursue red team or penetration testing?**
A: Red teaming: More strategic, longer engagements, similar pay. Penetration testing: Faster-paced, more variety. Red teaming positions are usually for senior professionals (post-OSCP).

**Q: Can 94F background skip Security+?**
A: No, it's federal requirement (DoD 8570). Even with military background, civilian employers require it. Fast to obtain (2-3 months).

**Q: How do I specialize within cybersecurity?**
A: After OSCP, specializations include: cloud security, mobile application testing, API security, ICS/SCADA security, hardware hacking. Each has unique earning potential.
