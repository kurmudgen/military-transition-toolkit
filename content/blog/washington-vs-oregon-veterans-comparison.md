## Final Verdict

### Choose Washington if:
- You earn $100,000+ (high-earning advantage)
- You work in tech/aerospace
- You want zero state income tax
- You prefer mountain recreation
- You can afford higher cost of living

### Choose Oregon if:
- You're on military retirement income only
- You want lower overall cost of living (3-4%)
- You prefer beach and wine country recreation
- You seek progressive, arts-focused communities
- You want to maximize purchasing power

**The Numbers:** Washington's tax advantage (no income tax) is significant for higher earners but less impactful for military retirees with modest additional income. Oregon's lower cost of living (3-4%) partially offsets Washington's tax advantage.

For a military retiree with $45,000 pension + modest other income, costs are essentially equivalent. For high-earning professionals, Washington's tax-free income is decisive.

**Choose based on income level and lifestyle:** Washington for high earners and tech professionals, Oregon for budget-conscious retirees who value beach recreation and wine country.
