# How to Stop Using Military Jargon in Civilian Life: Communication Guide for Veterans

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Your military jargon marks you as military instantly—not always helpful.** Civilian world uses different language. It's not better, just different. **Key: Maintain military values (directness, honesty, clarity) while using civilian language.** You don't have to change who you are, just how you express it. **Timeline: 3-6 months to adjust. Some jargon will stay forever (and that's fine).**

## Why Military Jargon Doesn't Translate

### The Problem with Jargon

**Military jargon:**
- Serves a purpose (efficient communication, bonding, identity)
- Creates community (you're "in the know")
- Marks status (you speak the lingo, you belong)
- Saves time in military context (everyone knows acronyms)

**In civilian context:**
- Creates barriers (people don't understand)
- Marks you as different (outsider, military)
- Confuses communication (people aren't sure what you mean)
- Can seem exclusive or rude (like you're showing off)

**Example:** "I need to get that ASAP, no dilly-dally, roger?"
- **Military:** Clear, efficient, understood
- **Civilian:** Confusing ("roger?" what?), seems aggressive ("no dilly-dally?")

### Common Jargon Translation

| Military | Civilian | Better |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Roger that | Understood / Got it | "I understand" |
| Copy | I heard you | "I got that" |
| Negative | No | "No, that won't work" |
| Affirmative | Yes | "Yes, absolutely" |
| Dilly-dally | Waste time | "Let's move forward quickly" |
| Gear up | Get ready | "Let me get prepared" |
| All hands on deck | Everyone needed | "I need everyone's help" |
| ASAP | As soon as possible | "This is urgent" |
| Double time | Hurry | "Can we do this faster?" |
| At ease | Relax | "You can relax" |
| Suck it up | Deal with it | "I know it's hard, but we can handle it" |
| No pain, no gain | Struggle is worth it | "This is challenging but worthwhile" |
| Stand down | Stop / Finish | "Let's take a break" |
| Touch base | Connect / Check in | "Let me follow up with you" |
| Downrange | In theater / Combat | "In [country]" / "In active conflict" |
| Hurry up and wait | Inefficiency | "This process is frustratingly slow" |

## Real Examples

### Workplace Example

**Military style:** "Hey, grab your tactical gear and report to the conference room. We're executing a strategy session on the Q4 objectives. Don't be late or we're starting without you."

**Civilian translation:** "Hi! Could you join us in the conference room at 2pm? We're meeting to plan Q4 strategy. Hope to see you there!"

**Key differences:**
- Military uses orders/commands
- Civilian uses requests/invitations
- Military is formal/hierarchical
- Civilian is friendly/egalitarian
- Military creates urgency
- Civilian is collaborative

### Social Example

**Military style:** "That event last night was unsat. Civilians were being fobits, no sense of mission focus. They were just dilly-dallying and not getting after it."

**Civilian translation:** "I didn't enjoy the party last night. People seemed distracted and weren't really engaging. It felt a bit unfocused."

**Key differences:**
- Military judges against military standard
- Civilian just describes the experience
- Military is judgmental
- Civilian is observational

## How to Transition

### Phase 1: Awareness (Week 1-2)

**Recognize your jargon:**
- [ ] Record yourself (voice memo)
- [ ] Listen back (cringe-worthy, right?)
- [ ] List the jargon you use most
- [ ] Ask people: "Do I use military terms? Which ones?"

**Your top jargon is probably:**
- Acronyms (ASAP, etc.)
- Military commands (Roger, Copy, Negative)
- Military phrases ("no dilly-dally," "suck it up")
- Military values language (mission, duty, honor)
- Military titles/positions

### Phase 2: Adjust (Weeks 3-8)

**Target your top 5 jargon words:**

Pick your most-used terms and consciously replace them.

**Example: Replace "Roger"**
- Catch yourself saying "Roger"
- Pause
- Replace with "I understand"
- After 10-20 times, it becomes automatic

**Do this for each of your top 5 terms**

**Timeline:** Each term takes 2-3 weeks to replace. So 10-15 weeks total for top 5.

### Phase 3: Normalize (Weeks 8+)

**By month 3, you should:**
- Naturally use civilian language
- Occasionally slip into military jargon (that's fine)
- Understand the difference
- Be able to code-switch (military slang with vets, civilian language with civilians)

## What You DON'T Have to Change

### Military Values Stay

**Direct communication:** Keep it.
- Military value: Tell the truth, fast
- Civilian translation: "I need to give you some feedback" instead of "You messed up"
- You're not changing value, just delivery

**Accountability:** Keep it.
- Military value: Ownership and responsibility
- Civilian translation: "That's my responsibility" instead of "That's my mission"
- Same meaning, different words

**Integrity:** Keep it.
- Military value: Honesty, keeping your word
- Civilian translation: "I'll do what I said I would" instead of "Mission complete"
- Same commitment, different phrasing

**Work ethic:** Keep it.
- Military value: Hard work, dedication
- Civilian translation: Show through actions, not words
- Let work speak for itself

### Slang That's Actually Okay

**Some military slang is fine:**
- Using it with veteran friends (perfectly fine, even good)
- Occasional slips (normal, people understand)
- Using it to explain military experience ("When I was downrange...") — fine in context

**Others to avoid:**
- Using it constantly with civilians (marks you as unable to adapt)
- Using it to exclude non-vets (comes across as mean)
- Using it to seem tough/cool (reads as insecure)
- Using acronyms civilians don't understand (confusing)

## Practical Tips

### Tip 1: Pause and Translate

**When you're about to say military jargon:**
- Pause for 1 second
- Translate to civilian
- Say civilian version

**Example:**
- Thought: "Roger that"
- Pause
- Translation: "I understand"
- Say: "I understand"

**After 2-3 weeks, this becomes automatic.**

### Tip 2: Ask for Feedback

**Ask trusted coworker:**
"Hey, do I use military terms? I'm trying to adjust to civilian communication. Can you let me know when I do?"

**Most people will appreciate your awareness and help you.**

### Tip 3: Listen More

**Notice how civilians communicate:**
- Pay attention to word choice
- How do they give feedback?
- How do they give orders/requests?
- How do they celebrate success?
- Copy that style

### Tip 4: Code-Switching

**Understand context matters:**
- With military friends: Military jargon is fine (actually preferred)
- With civilians: Use civilian language
- In mixed groups: Default to civilian (safer)
- In professional settings: Definitely use civilian

**This is healthy. Everyone code-switches (you just didn't realize it).**

## FAQ

**Q: Will I ever stop using military jargon?**
A: Probably not completely. Some will stick forever. That's normal. Just reduce it for civilian contexts.

**Q: Is using military language unprofessional?**
A: In civilian workplace, yes. But small amounts are forgiven. Constant jargon reads as unable to adapt.

**Q: Should I hide that I'm military?**
A: No. You can be visibly military without using jargon. It's not about hiding, it's about adapting communication.

**Q: What if civilians don't understand military terminology?**
A: That's exactly why you should avoid it. Communication is about being understood.

**Q: Is it wrong to use military jargon?**
A: Not wrong, just less effective in civilian context. Think of it like language—speaking Spanish in an English-speaking country isn't wrong, just harder to communicate.

## Action Plan

### Week 1: Awareness
- [ ] Record yourself or ask people: What military terms do I use most?
- [ ] List top 5 military jargon words you use constantly

### Week 2: Study Alternatives
- [ ] Look up civilian translations for your top 5
- [ ] Practice saying them
- [ ] Get comfortable with civilian versions

### Week 3-6: Replace One at a Time
- [ ] Pick #1 military jargon word
- [ ] Replace it for 2-3 weeks
- [ ] Move to #2, then #3, etc.

### Week 6-12: Normalize
- [ ] By now, civilian language should be automatic
- [ ] You'll occasionally slip into military jargon (fine)
- [ ] Most people won't notice anymore

### Month 3+: Maintenance
- [ ] You can code-switch (military with vets, civilian with others)
- [ ] Enjoy being bidialectal (speaking two ways based on context)

## Bottom Line

**You're not losing your military identity by using civilian language. You're learning to communicate effectively in a new environment.** Your military values (integrity, directness, accountability) stay. Just the words change. Most people won't even notice after a few months. You'll adapt, and it'll be fine.
