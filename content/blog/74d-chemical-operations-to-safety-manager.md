## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1:** Not getting OSHA 30 certification immediately. This is non-negotiable requirement. Get it in first 2 weeks.

**Mistake #2:** Starting only at coordinator level. If you have supervisory experience, target specialist or manager positions directly for higher pay.

**Mistake #3:** Ignoring chemical industry. Pay 15-20% higher than general manufacturing. Target refineries and chemical plants specifically.

**Mistake #4:** Not pursuing ASP or CSP certifications. These significantly increase earning potential. Plan for these early.

**Mistake #5:** Limiting search geographically. Chemical manufacturing concentrated in specific regions (Texas, Louisiana, Midwest). Consider relocation for best opportunities.
