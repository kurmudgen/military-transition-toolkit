## Education Benefits for Illinois Veterans

### Illinois Veteran Grant (IVG) - FREE TUITION

This is Illinois's flagship education benefit and **one of the best state veteran education programs in the entire nation**.

**What it covers**: Tuition and mandatory fees at **ALL** Illinois public universities, colleges, and community colleges

**Cost to you**: **$0** for tuition at public schools

**Eligibility**:
- Served at least one year of federal active duty **OR**
- Served in foreign country during time of hostilities and honorably discharged **OR**
- Currently serving on active duty

**AND**

- Illinois resident 6 months prior to entering active duty **OR**
- Returned to Illinois within 6 months of separation

**How long**: Equivalent of **4 academic years** of full-time enrollment (120 credit hours)

**Applies to**: Undergraduate **AND** graduate programs

**Qualifying schools** (all Illinois public institutions):
- University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago, Springfield)
- Illinois State University
- Northern Illinois University
- Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, Edwardsville)
- Eastern Illinois University
- Western Illinois University
- Governors State University
- Northeastern Illinois University
- Chicago State University
- All 48 Illinois community colleges
- All other public universities

**How to stack with GI Bill**: You can use both!

**Example**:
- IVG covers tuition at University of Illinois: $0 out-of-pocket
- Post-9/11 GI Bill provides BAH: ~$1,400/month in Champaign-Urbana
- Total benefit: Free tuition + $1,400/month living allowance

**This is massive.** Illinois is one of only a handful of states offering completely free tuition at public universities for veterans.

### How to Apply for Illinois Veteran Grant

**Application**: One-time application via ISAC Student Portal

**Website**: [isac.org](https://www.isac.org/isac-gift-assistance-programs/illinois-veteran-grant/)

**Phone**: (800) 899-4722

**Required documents**:
- DD-214 (all periods of service)
- Proof of Illinois residency
- College enrollment verification

**Processing time**: Approximately 12 weeks - apply early!

**Deadline**: Must apply with sufficient time for processing before last day of classes in term

**Important**: Once approved, you receive an IVG Notice of Eligibility. Present this to your school's financial aid office.

**GPA requirement**: Must maintain minimum GPA required by your institution (typically 2.0)

**2025-26 funding**: $6 million appropriated for IVG program

### In-State Tuition for Veterans (Choice Act)

Under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA), veterans using GI Bill benefits qualify for **in-state tuition** at Illinois public schools regardless of how long you've lived in Illinois.

**Eligibility**:
- Using Post-9/11 GI Bill or Montgomery GI Bill
- Living in Illinois while attending school
- Enrolling within 3 years of discharge

**Benefit**: Eliminates out-of-state tuition surcharge (typically $15,000-25,000/year)

**Combined with IVG**: If you're eligible for IVG, this is less relevant since IVG covers full tuition anyway. But if you exhaust IVG or don't qualify, in-state tuition saves thousands.

### Post-9/11 GI Bill - Yellow Ribbon Schools

While IVG covers tuition at public schools, some Illinois schools participate in Yellow Ribbon for private schools or graduate programs:

#### Northwestern University
**Yellow Ribbon**: Yes
**Slots**: Varies by program
**Benefit**: Covers gap between GI Bill and private tuition (Northwestern tuition: ~$65,000/year)

**Veteran Services**: (847) 491-7110
**Website**: [northwestern.edu/sfs](https://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/financial-aid-and-loans/va-benefits/)

#### DePaul University
**Yellow Ribbon**: Yes
**Slots**: Unlimited for undergraduate, limited for graduate
**Benefit**: Full coverage of tuition gap

**Veteran Services**: (312) 362-8437

#### Loyola University Chicago
**Yellow Ribbon**: Yes
**Slots**: Varies
**Benefit**: Partial to full coverage

**Note**: Most Illinois veterans should use IVG at public schools rather than Yellow Ribbon at private schools, as IVG provides equal or better benefits at zero cost.
