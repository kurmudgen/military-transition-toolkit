### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"I was an 11 Bravo—infantry grunt. I spent 6 years kicking in doors and doing patrols. When I got out, I had no idea what civilian job I was qualified for. 'Professional door kicker' isn't exactly on LinkedIn.

But then I figured out how to translate my actual skills—and I ended up as a project manager making $85,000. Let me show you exactly how I did it."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:50)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and today we're talking about the most common question I get from transitioning veterans: 'What civilian job can I do with my MOS?'

**The problem:**
Your MOS is super specific—68W, 35F, 25B, AV, OS, whatever. But when you look at civilian job postings, none of them say 'Looking for former 31B' or 'Need an ex-92G.'

**The solution:**
You need to stop thinking about your MOS as a job title and start thinking about the transferable skills you developed.

Today I'm going to walk you through:
1. How to identify your transferable skills
2. How to research civilian job matches
3. Real examples for common MOS categories
4. The exact process I used

Let's dive in."

#### Step 1: Stop Thinking Job Title, Start Thinking Skills (0:50-2:30)
"First, you need to shift your mindset.

**Wrong approach:**
'I was an 11B infantry rifleman. What's the civilian equivalent of that?'

**Answer:** There isn't one. Civilians don't have an equivalent job.

**Right approach:**
'What skills did I actually develop as an 11B?'

**Let's break it down:**

**As an 11B, you developed:**
- Leadership (team leader, squad leader)
- Planning and preparation (mission planning, rehearsals)
- Adaptability (things never go according to plan)
- Decision-making under pressure
- Navigation and route planning
- Physical endurance and discipline
- Teamwork and communication
- Risk assessment
- Equipment maintenance
- Training others

**Now look at civilian jobs that need these skills:**
- Project Manager (planning, leadership, adaptability)
- Operations Manager (coordination, problem-solving, team leadership)
- Logistics Coordinator (planning, attention to detail)
- Safety Manager (risk assessment, procedures)
- Training Specialist (teaching, curriculum development)
- Emergency Management (crisis response, planning)

**See what happened?**
We went from 'infantry rifleman' to six different civilian career paths by focusing on skills, not job title.

**This works for ANY MOS.**

**Exercise:**
Write down your MOS. Now list 10-15 skills you actually used in that role. Don't use military jargon. Use civilian terms like:
- Leadership
- Communication
- Problem-solving
- Technical skills
- Planning
- Budget management
- Team coordination

These are your transferable skills. These are what employers care about."

---

#### Step 4: My Actual Translation Process (8:00-9:30)
"Let me walk you through the exact process I used as an 11B.

**Step 1: Skills inventory (took me 2 hours)**
I wrote down everything I'd done:
- Led a team of 4-9 soldiers
- Planned and executed missions
- Trained new soldiers
- Managed equipment worth $500K+
- Made decisions under stress
- Wrote reports and briefings

**Step 2: Civilian translation (took me 1 hour)**
I rewrote each skill in civilian terms:
- Led cross-functional teams → Leadership
- Planned missions → Project planning
- Trained new soldiers → Training & development
- Managed equipment → Asset management
- Made decisions under stress → Problem-solving
- Wrote reports → Written communication

**Step 3: Job research (took me 2 weeks)**
I used O*NET and searched for jobs that needed these skills:
- Typed 'project coordinator' into Indeed
- Read 20+ job descriptions
- Highlighted skills they wanted
- Matched them to my experience

**Step 4: Informational interviews (took me 1 month)**
I reached out to 10 project managers on LinkedIn:
- Asked if I could have a 15-minute call to learn about their job
- 6 responded, 4 actually talked to me
- Learned what the job really involved
- Asked what skills from my background would transfer

**Step 5: Tailored application (ongoing)**
I applied to 15 project coordinator roles with a resume that emphasized:
- Leadership (not infantry skills)
- Planning (not mission planning)
- Problem-solving (not combat)

**Results:**
- 3 phone screens
- 2 in-person interviews
- 1 job offer at $55K

**18 months later:**
Got promoted to Project Manager at $85K.

**Total time investment:**
About 40 hours of research, networking, and application prep. Best investment I ever made."

### Common Mistakes to Avoid (9:30-10:30)
"Before we wrap up, here are three mistakes I see veterans make:

**Mistake #1: Only looking at direct translations**
Don't limit yourself to jobs that sound like your MOS. An 11B can be a project manager. A 42A can work in cybersecurity if they get certifications. Be open.

**Mistake #2: Not considering certifications**
Many high-paying civilian jobs require certifications that take 3-6 months to get. Use your GI Bill or SkillBridge to get them before you separate.

Examples:
- PMP for project management
- Security+ for cybersecurity
- CCNA for networking
- CPA for accounting

**Mistake #3: Underselling your leadership**
Every veteran has leadership experience. Even if you weren't an NCO, you led. You trained others. You made decisions. Don't hide this—it's what makes you valuable.

Civilian companies are desperate for people who can lead teams and get stuff done. That's you."

---

### RECAP (10:30-11:00)
"Alright, quick recap:

**Step 1:** Stop thinking about MOS as a job title; think about skills
**Step 2:** Use translator tools (O*NET, My Next Move, CareerOneStop)
**Step 3:** Research civilian careers that need your skills
**Step 4:** Do informational interviews to learn about those careers
**Step 5:** Tailor your resume to emphasize transferable skills

**Remember:**
Your MOS doesn't define your civilian career. Your skills do. And you have way more valuable skills than you think."
