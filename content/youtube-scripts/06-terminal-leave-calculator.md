#### What is Terminal Leave? (0:50-2:00)
"First, let's make sure we're all on the same page.

**Terminal leave definition:**
Terminal leave is when you use your accrued leave days at the end of your military service, right before your official separation or retirement date.

**How it works:**

Let's say:
- Your separation date is June 30, 2025
- You have 60 days of leave saved up
- You take terminal leave

**Your timeline:**
- Your last day of work: May 1, 2025 (roughly)
- Terminal leave period: May 1 - June 30 (60 days)
- Official separation date: June 30, 2025
- You continue getting paid your full base pay during this time
- You keep all benefits (healthcare, housing allowance, etc.) until June 30

**What terminal leave is NOT:**
- It's not extra money on top of your salary
- It's not a bonus
- It's literally just taking your earned leave before you separate

**Why it matters:**
Understanding terminal leave lets you:
1. Stop working earlier while still getting paid
2. Start your civilian job while still on active duty
3. Keep your military benefits longer
4. Maximize your financial situation during transition"

#### How to Calculate Your Terminal Leave (2:00-4:00)
"Alright, let's do the math.

**Step 1: Check your leave balance**
- Log into myPay (myPay.dfas.mil)
- Look at your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)
- Find the 'Leave' section—it shows your current balance

**Example LES:**
- Leave Balance: 57 days

**Step 2: Project future leave accrual**

You accrue 2.5 days of leave per month.

Let's say:
- Today's date: January 1, 2025
- Current leave balance: 57 days
- Planned separation date: June 30, 2025
- Months until separation: 6 months

**Calculation:**
6 months × 2.5 days/month = 15 days additional leave
57 days (current) + 15 days (future) = 72 days total

**But wait—there's a cap:**
You can only carry over 60 days of leave into the next fiscal year (October 1).

**Special circumstances:**
- If you're in a combat zone or designated deployment area, you may have "special leave accrual" (SLA) that allows more than 60 days
- Check your LES for SLA notation

**Step 3: Calculate terminal leave dates**

**Formula:**
Separation date - Leave days = Last day of work

**Example:**
- Separation date: June 30, 2025
- Leave balance: 72 days
- Last day of work: April 20, 2025 (approximately—depends on weekends)

**Pro tip:**
Use a leave calculator to account for weekends and holidays. Regular days off don't count against your leave.

**Step 4: Calculate your terminal leave pay**

**Formula:**
(Base pay per month ÷ 30 days) × Number of leave days = Terminal leave value

**Example:**
- Base pay: $4,500/month (E-5 with 8 years)
- Daily rate: $4,500 ÷ 30 = $150/day
- Leave days: 72
- Terminal leave value: $150 × 72 = $10,800

**During those 72 days, you'll earn:**
- Base pay: $10,800
- BAH (if applicable): Let's say $1,800/month × 2.4 months = $4,320
- BAS (if applicable): $460/month × 2.4 months = $1,104

**Total: $16,224 over 72 days**

**Plus:**
- You keep your healthcare through separation date
- You can start your civilian job during this period (double income!)

**Important caveat:**
If you're getting BAH, make sure you understand the rules for your separation location. Some people lose BAH if they move before their separation date—check with your finance office."

#### Terminal Leave vs Selling Leave: Which is Better? (4:00-6:30)
"This is the big question: Should you take terminal leave or sell it?

**Option 1: Take terminal leave**
- Stop working earlier
- Keep all benefits until separation date
- Continue earning BAH and BAS
- Can start civilian job early (double income)

**Option 2: Sell your leave (leave sell-back)**
- Work until your separation date
- Get a lump sum payment for unused leave
- Only base pay is compensated (no BAH or BAS)
- Payment is taxed at a higher rate (lump sum)

**Let's compare with real numbers:**

**Scenario: E-5 with 60 days of leave**
- Base pay: $4,500/month ($150/day)
- BAH: $1,800/month ($60/day)
- BAS: $460/month ($15/day)
- Total daily rate: $225/day

**Option 1: Take terminal leave (60 days)**
- Base pay: 60 × $150 = $9,000
- BAH: 60 × $60 = $3,600
- BAS: 60 × $15 = $900
- Healthcare: Continues for 60 more days
- **Total value: $13,500 + healthcare**

**Plus:** You can start a civilian job during this time
- If civilian job pays $70K/year ($191/day)
- 60 days of civilian work = $11,460
- **Combined income: $24,960**

**Option 2: Sell leave (60 days)**
- Lump sum: 60 × $150 = $9,000
- Minus taxes (25-30%): ~$6,750 net
- No BAH, no BAS, no healthcare extension
- **Total value: $6,750**

**The winner?**
Taking terminal leave is almost always better financially, especially if you have a civilian job lined up.

**When selling might make sense:**
1. You don't have a job lined up and need cash immediately
2. You're moving to an expensive area and need money for the move
3. You're staying in and just want to cash out some leave to avoid losing it

**Important note:**
You can only sell back a maximum of 60 days of leave over your entire military career. If you've already sold leave before (like when re-enlisting), that counts toward your 60-day lifetime limit."

#### Strategic Terminal Leave Planning (6:30-8:30)
"Now let's talk strategy—how to maximize your terminal leave.

**Strategy #1: Start your civilian job while on terminal leave**

This is the power move.

**Example:**
- Last day of work: May 1, 2025
- Terminal leave: May 1 - June 30 (60 days)
- Civilian job start date: June 1, 2025

**During June:**
- Military pay: $4,500 (base) + $1,800 (BAH) + $460 (BAS) = $6,760
- Civilian pay: $6,000 (if $72K/year salary)
- **Total June income: $12,760**

**Why this works:**
- You're technically still on active duty, so military pays you
- You're also working your civilian job
- Both incomes are legal and allowed
- You basically get a 2x paycheck for part of your terminal leave

**How to pull this off:**
1. Start job hunting 6-9 months before separation
2. When you get an offer, negotiate a start date during your terminal leave period
3. Most employers are understanding and flexible with veterans

**Strategy #2: Time your separation date strategically**

**Option A: Separate at end of month**
- Maximizes BAH (you get full month even if you separate mid-month)
- Example: Separate June 30 instead of June 15 = extra 15 days of BAH

**Option B: Separate early in fiscal year**
- If you have more than 60 days of leave on October 1, you'll lose it
- Plan to separate in October-December to use that extra leave

**Strategy #3: Coordinate with job start dates**

**Bad timing:**
- Terminal leave ends December 20
- Civilian job doesn't start until January 2
- You have 2 weeks of no income and no benefits

**Good timing:**
- Terminal leave ends December 31
- Civilian job starts January 2
- Smooth transition with only 2 days gap

**Strategy #4: Consider TAMP (Transitional Assistance Management Program)**

**What is TAMP?**
- 180 days of temporary healthcare coverage after separation
- Free for qualifying service members
- Eligibility: Depends on circumstances (involuntary separation, OCONUS orders, etc.)

**Why it matters for terminal leave:**
- If you qualify for TAMP, you get 180 days of healthcare after separation
- This might change your calculation on when to use terminal leave

**Strategy #5: Don't forget about SkillBridge**

**What is SkillBridge?**
- DoD program allowing you to do civilian job training in your last 180 days
- You stay on active duty, keep getting paid and benefits
- You work for a civilian company (training/internship)

**The combo move:**
- Do SkillBridge for 90 days (training with civilian company)
- Take 60 days of terminal leave after SkillBridge
- You've essentially been working civilian-side for 5 months while still getting military pay

**This is how you maximize everything.**"

#### Common Terminal Leave Mistakes (8:30-10:00)
"Let's talk about mistakes I see all the time.

**Mistake #1: Not planning early enough**

You need to submit your terminal leave request at least 30-60 days in advance, sometimes more depending on your command.

**What happens if you wait:**
- Your command disapproves it due to manning
- You're forced to sell leave (less money)
- You miss the window to start your civilian job early

**Solution:** Start the paperwork 90 days out.

**Mistake #2: Not checking your LES**

I've seen service members think they have 60 days, but their LES shows 45 because of data errors.

**Solution:** Check your LES every month in your last year of service.

**Mistake #3: Using leave during your terminal leave period**

This sounds confusing, but here's what I mean:

Some people burn leave throughout the year, then don't have enough for a long terminal leave period.

**Solution:** Hoard your leave in your final year. Take minimal leave so you have maximum terminal leave.

**Mistake #4: Not understanding BAH rules**

If you move out of your current location before your separation date, you might lose BAH.

**Example:**
- You're stationed in California (high BAH)
- You take terminal leave and immediately move to Texas
- Finance finds out, stops your California BAH
- You lose thousands of dollars

**Solution:** Talk to your finance office about timing of your move.

**Mistake #5: Forgetting about taxes**

Terminal leave isn't taxed differently than normal pay, but if you're also working a civilian job, your total income for that year increases.

**Example:**
- Military income Jan-June: $40,000
- Civilian income June-Dec: $45,000
- Total: $85,000 (might push you into higher tax bracket)

**Solution:** Set aside extra money for taxes, or adjust your W-4 at your civilian job.

**Mistake #6: Not coordinating terminal leave with spouse**

If you're both active duty:
- Coordinate your terminal leave dates
- Consider staggering them so you have income continuity
- Make sure you understand dual-military BAH rules

**Mistake #7: Thinking terminal leave is 'free money'**

It's not free money—it's your earned leave. You already earned it. Terminal leave is just the smartest way to use it."
