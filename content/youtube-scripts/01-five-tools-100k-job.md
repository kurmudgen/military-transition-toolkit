### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"Six months after leaving the Navy, I landed a $100,000 project management job. And honestly? I almost gave up after my first 50 applications went nowhere. But then I discovered these five tools that completely changed everything. Let me show you exactly what I used."

[Point to camera] "Stick around because tool number four literally got me three interviews in one week."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:45)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and I separated from the Navy in 2024 after 8 years as an Operations Specialist. When I started my job search, I made every mistake in the book—military jargon on my resume, applying to jobs I wasn't qualified for, and honestly having no idea what I was even worth in the civilian market.

But once I started using the right tools, everything clicked. So today I'm breaking down the exact five tools I used, why they worked, and how you can start using them today—most of them are completely free."

#### Tool #1: Military Skills Translator (0:45-2:30)
"Alright, tool number one completely changed my approach: **A Military Skills Translator.**

Here's the problem—I would write things like 'supervised tactical operations center' and 'managed classified communications systems.' Guess how many callbacks I got? Zero. Because civilian hiring managers have no idea what that means.

**What I used:**
- The O*NET Military Crosswalk
- The VA's Military Skills Translator
- And honestly, just googling '[my MOS] civilian equivalent'

**How to use it:**
Step 1: Go to the O*NET website—completely free
Step 2: Enter your MOS or rating
Step 3: You'll get a list of civilian job titles that match your skills

For example, as an Operations Specialist (OS), it showed me:
- Logistics Analyst
- Operations Coordinator
- Project Manager
- Supply Chain Analyst

**Why this matters:**
Now instead of saying 'managed communications,' I said 'coordinated cross-functional team communications for time-sensitive operations with zero downtime.' Same job, civilian language.

This single change tripled my interview rate. Not kidding."

#### Tool #2: LinkedIn Premium (2:30-4:15)
"Tool number two: **LinkedIn Premium.** Now before you click away—yes, it costs money, but hear me out.

**The game-changer features:**
1. **InMail credits** - You can message hiring managers directly, even if you're not connected
2. **'Open to Work' private mode** - Recruiters can see you're looking, but your current employer can't
3. **See who viewed your profile** - This is huge for networking
4. **Applicant insights** - You can see how you stack up against other applicants

**What I did with it:**
- Used my 5 free InMail credits each month to message hiring managers at companies I wanted to work for
- Sent a simple message: 'Hi [Name], I'm a transitioning Navy veteran with 8 years in operations management. I noticed your posting for [Job Title]. I'd love to learn more about the role and how my leadership experience could add value to your team.'
- Got responses to about 30% of these messages
- Three of those conversations led to interviews

**Pro tip:**
If you're within 6 months of separation, you can usually get LinkedIn Premium Career for $29.99/month. Try it for 2-3 months during your heavy job search phase. Cancel after you land the job.

**ROI:**
Cost me about $90. Got me a $100K job. Do the math."

#### Tool #3: Salary Research Platform - Glassdoor/Payscale (4:15-5:45)
"Tool number three: **Know your worth with Glassdoor and Payscale.**

This is critical—most veterans undervalue themselves because we don't know civilian salary ranges.

**My mistake:**
In my first interviews, when they asked my salary expectations, I said $55,000. You know why? Because that's roughly what I was making as an E-5.

**The reality:**
For a project coordinator role with my experience? The range was $70K-$95K.

I was leaving $20,000-$40,000 on the table just because I didn't do my homework.

**How to use these tools:**

**Glassdoor:**
- Search the job title
- Filter by location
- Read the actual employee reviews about salary
- Look at the 'typical range' not just the average

**Payscale:**
- Use their salary calculator
- Input your years of experience, education, location
- Gets pretty accurate

**What I learned:**
- Entry-level Project Coordinator: $55K-$70K
- Mid-level Project Manager: $75K-$95K
- Senior Project Manager: $95K-$120K+

Armed with this data, when they asked my expectations in later interviews, I said $85K-$95K. I ended up at $102K because I knew my value.

**Pro tip:**
Always give a range, not a single number. And base it on data, not feelings."

#### Tool #4: Job Application Tracker (5:45-7:15)
"Tool number four is boring but powerful: **A job application tracker.**

When I started, I was just randomly applying to jobs. I had no idea what I'd applied to, when I applied, or who I needed to follow up with. It was chaos.

**What I used:**
I used a simple Google Sheets template. You can also use:
- Huntr (free tier is solid)
- Teal (has a free Chrome extension)
- JibberJobber
- Or just Google Sheets—seriously, don't overthink it

**What to track:**
1. Company name
2. Job title
3. Date applied
4. Application link/job posting
5. Contact person (if you have one)
6. Follow-up dates
7. Interview dates
8. Status (applied, phone screen, interview, offer, rejected)
9. Notes (what went well, what to improve)

**Why this changed everything:**

Week 1 of tracking: I realized I was applying to 15 jobs per week but had zero follow-up system
Week 2: I started following up 7 days after applying
Week 3: I got three responses to my follow-ups, leading to two phone screens

**The follow-up template I used:**
'Hi [Name], I applied for the [Job Title] position on [Date] and wanted to express my continued interest. As a Navy veteran with 8 years of operations and leadership experience, I believe I'd be a strong fit for your team. I'd love to discuss how my skills could contribute to [Company's] goals. Are you available for a brief call this week?'

**Results:**
About 20% of my follow-ups got responses. Without tracking, I never would have followed up at all."

#### Tool #5: Interview Prep Platform - Big Interview (7:15-9:00)
"And tool number five: **Big Interview or similar interview prep platform.**

Here's the thing—military interviews are nothing like civilian interviews. In the military, if you're qualified, you get the job. In the civilian world? The most qualified person doesn't always win. The best interviewer does.

**My problem:**
I would answer questions with military stories full of acronyms. When they asked 'Tell me about a time you led a team,' I'd say stuff like:

'When I was LCPO of the operations department, we had a major CASREP that required immediate coordination with SUPPO and the XO to ensure mission readiness...'

The interviewer's eyes would glaze over.

**What I used:**
- Big Interview (paid, but worth it)
- Mock interview practice
- The STAR method training

**What I learned:**

**STAR Method:**
- **S**ituation - Set the scene (2 sentences max)
- **T**ask - What was the challenge?
- **A**ction - What did YOU do specifically?
- **R**esult - What was the outcome? (Use numbers if possible)

**Example of my improved answer:**
'In my previous role managing a 25-person operations team, we faced a critical equipment failure that could have delayed a major project deadline. I coordinated with our supply and maintenance teams to source replacement parts within 48 hours, developed a backup plan, and kept all stakeholders informed throughout the process. As a result, we completed the project on time and received recognition from senior leadership for our problem-solving under pressure.'

Same story. Zero acronyms. Clear result.

**Practice reps:**
I did 20+ mock interviews using Big Interview's AI feedback. By interview number 5 in real life, I felt confident.

**ROI:**
Cost: $79 for 3 months
Result: Aced my final interview
Worth it? Absolutely."

### RECAP & BONUS TIP (9:00-10:00)
"Alright, let's recap the five tools:

1. **Military Skills Translator** - Translate your experience into civilian language
2. **LinkedIn Premium** - Direct access to hiring managers and recruiters
3. **Glassdoor/Payscale** - Know your market value
4. **Job Application Tracker** - Stay organized and follow up
5. **Big Interview** - Practice until you're interview-ready

**Bonus tip:**
Don't use all five tools at once. You'll get overwhelmed. Start with #1 and #3—translate your skills and know your worth. Then add the others as you build momentum.

**The real secret?**
These tools work, but only if you put in the work. I applied to 147 jobs over 4 months. I got 23 phone screens, 11 first-round interviews, 4 second-round interviews, and 2 offers.

That's a lot of rejection. But I stayed consistent, used these tools, and kept improving every week."
