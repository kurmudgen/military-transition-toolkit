## SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"I bombed my first three civilian job interviews. I had the experience, I had the qualifications, but every time I opened my mouth, I watched the interviewer's eyes glaze over.

Why? Because I was speaking military, and they were speaking civilian. Let me show you the exact changes I made that got me hired on my fourth try."

[Show two different responses side by side] "Same story. Completely different reaction."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:50)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and today we're talking about civilian interviews for veterans.

**Here's the problem:**
You're qualified. You have leadership, problem-solving, and work ethic that most civilians lack. But you're not getting job offers.

**Why?**
Because military interviews and civilian interviews are completely different animals.

**What we're covering:**
1. The biggest mistakes veterans make in interviews
2. How to translate military stories to civilian language
3. The STAR method (with veteran examples)
4. Questions you'll definitely get asked (and how to answer them)
5. Real before-and-after examples

Let's dive in."

#### Mistake #1: Using Military Jargon (0:50-2:45)
"The biggest mistake—and I'm guilty of this—is using military jargon in your answers.

**Bad interview answer (what I said in my first interview):**

Interviewer: 'Tell me about a time you led a team.'

Me: 'When I was a team leader in 2nd PLT, we were tasked with conducting mounted patrols in sector 3. I had to coordinate with higher for OPORD dissemination, conduct PCCs and PCIs, and ensure comms with TOC. We maintained a 100% mission success rate and zero TICs during our rotation.'

**The interviewer's face:** Confused. Blank stare. Polite nod.

**What they heard:** 'Blah blah military stuff blah blah acronyms blah.'

**Why this fails:**
- OPORD, PCC, PCI, TOC, TIC = meaningless to civilians
- 'Mounted patrols in sector 3' = they don't know what this means
- You gave zero details about leadership skills

**Good interview answer (what I should have said):**

'I led a team of four people during a 12-month deployment. My role was to plan daily operations, ensure everyone had the resources they needed, and coordinate with senior leadership. I also handled any problems that came up in real-time. Over 12 months, we completed over 300 missions with zero safety incidents and 100% success rate. I credit that to clear communication, detailed planning, and making sure my team felt supported.'

**What changed:**
- No acronyms
- Focused on leadership skills (planning, communication, support)
- Gave measurable results (300 missions, zero incidents)
- Used civilian-friendly language

**The rule:**
If you wouldn't use the word at a family BBQ with your non-military relatives, don't use it in an interview.

**Quick acronym translator:**
- NCOIC → Supervisor or Manager
- OPORD → Project plan or Mission plan
- TOC → Operations center or Headquarters
- TIC → Incident or Engagement
- SOP → Standard procedure or Policy

Delete the acronyms. Speak civilian."

#### Mistake #2: Focusing on Duties Instead of Impact (2:45-4:30)
"Mistake number two: Talking about what your job was instead of what you accomplished.

**Bad answer:**

Interviewer: 'What were your responsibilities in your last role?'

Me: 'I was responsible for managing supply inventory for the unit. I tracked equipment, ordered parts, and maintained records. I also supervised two junior soldiers.'

**Why this fails:**
- Sounds like a job description
- No results, no impact, no story
- Boring and forgettable

**Good answer:**

'I managed supply inventory worth over $2 million for a 150-person organization. When I took over, we had a 30% error rate in inventory records, which was causing delays and budget issues. I implemented a new tracking system, trained my team of two on it, and reduced errors to less than 5% within six months. This saved the organization roughly $50,000 per year in lost or mismanaged equipment.'

**What changed:**
- Specific numbers ($2M inventory, 150 people, $50K savings)
- Described a problem (30% error rate)
- Described what you did (implemented system, trained team)
- Described the result (5% error rate, $50K savings)

**Formula:**
Problem → Action → Result

**Another example:**

**Bad:** 'I conducted vehicle maintenance.'

**Good:** 'I managed maintenance for five vehicles worth $500K each. By implementing a preventive maintenance schedule, I reduced breakdowns by 40% and extended vehicle lifespan by an estimated 2 years, saving the organization approximately $200,000 in replacement costs.'

**See the difference?**
Stop listing duties. Start telling impact stories."

---

#### Mistake #3: Not Using the STAR Method (4:30-6:30)
"Mistake three: Not structuring your answers properly.

**The STAR method is your best friend:**
- **S**ituation - Set the scene
- **T**ask - What was the challenge or goal?
- **A**ction - What did YOU do specifically?
- **R**esult - What was the outcome?

**Let's apply this to a common question:**

**Question: 'Tell me about a time you had to solve a difficult problem.'**

**Bad answer (no structure):**
'Oh man, there were lots of problems overseas. One time our equipment broke and we had to figure it out. It was pretty stressful, but we got it done. I'm good at problem-solving under pressure.'

**Why this fails:**
- Vague
- No details
- No clear outcome
- Doesn't prove you can problem-solve

**Good answer (using STAR):**

**Situation:**
'During my deployment, our primary communications equipment failed right before a major operation. This equipment was critical for coordination with other teams and headquarters.'

**Task:**
'My task was to find a solution within 4 hours so we could proceed with the operation as scheduled. Delaying wasn't an option because other teams were counting on us.'

**Action:**
'I immediately contacted our supply team to see if we had backup equipment—we didn't. So I coordinated with a neighboring unit to borrow their spare equipment. Meanwhile, I worked with our tech specialist to troubleshoot the original equipment. We discovered a simple wiring issue and repaired it within 90 minutes. I also created a backup plan using our secondary comms as a failsafe.'

**Result:**
'We completed the operation on schedule with zero communication issues. After that, I implemented a preventive maintenance check on all comms equipment before operations, which prevented similar issues for the rest of our deployment.'

**Why this works:**
- Clear structure
- Specific details (4-hour deadline, 90-minute repair)
- Shows your thought process
- Measurable outcome

**Pro tip:**
Prepare 5-7 STAR stories before your interview that cover:
1. Leadership
2. Problem-solving
3. Teamwork
4. Conflict resolution
5. Achieving a goal
6. Overcoming failure
7. Learning something new

These will cover 90% of behavioral interview questions."

#### Mistake #4: Not Translating Military Values (6:30-8:00)
"Mistake four: Not translating military values into civilian business language.

**You have values that employers desperately want:**
- Leadership
- Discipline
- Teamwork
- Adaptability
- Work ethic
- Integrity

**But you have to frame them properly.**

**Question: 'Why should we hire you?'**

**Bad answer:**
'I served in the Army for 8 years. I'm a hard worker, I show up on time, and I'm disciplined. I'm a team player and I follow orders.'

**Why this fails:**
- Generic (everyone says they're a hard worker)
- 'Follow orders' sounds like you can't think independently
- Doesn't explain how this helps the company

**Good answer:**
'In my 8 years of military service, I developed a strong ability to lead teams under pressure and deliver results on tight deadlines. For example, I regularly managed projects involving 10+ people, coordinating logistics, timelines, and problem-solving on the fly. I'm also highly adaptable—I've worked in constantly changing environments where priorities shift quickly, and I've learned to stay focused on the end goal while adjusting tactics as needed. What I bring to your team is someone who can take ownership of projects, work cross-functionally, and drive results even when things don't go according to plan.'

**What changed:**
- Tied military experience to business needs (project management, cross-functional work, results)
- Gave specific examples (10+ people, tight deadlines, changing priorities)
- Focused on value to the company (what you bring to their team)

**Translation guide:**

**Military trait → Civilian business value**
- 'I follow orders' → 'I execute on strategy and take direction well'
- 'I'm disciplined' → 'I have strong time management and organizational skills'
- 'I'm a team player' → 'I collaborate effectively across departments'
- 'I lead by example' → 'I set high standards and hold myself accountable'
- 'Mission first' → 'I focus on outcomes and prioritize what drives results'

**Stop underselling your military values. Just translate them correctly.**"

#### Mistake #5: Not Asking Good Questions (8:00-9:15)
"Mistake five: Not asking questions at the end, or asking bad questions.

**When the interviewer says 'Do you have any questions for us?'—this is not optional.**

You MUST ask questions. It shows you're interested, engaged, and thinking critically.

**Bad questions:**
- 'What does this company do?' (You should already know)
- 'How much vacation time do I get?' (Makes you seem focused on time off)
- 'What's the salary?' (Too early unless they bring it up)
- 'Did I get the job?' (Desperate and awkward)

**Good questions:**

**About the role:**
- 'What does success look like in this role in the first 90 days?'
- 'What are the biggest challenges someone in this position will face?'
- 'Can you describe what a typical day or week looks like?'

**About the team:**
- 'Can you tell me about the team I'd be working with?'
- 'What's the management style like here?'
- 'How does this team collaborate with other departments?'

**About the company:**
- 'What are the company's top priorities for the next year?'
- 'How would you describe the company culture?'
- 'What do you like most about working here?' (Ask the interviewer directly)

**About growth:**
- 'What are the opportunities for professional development?'
- 'How does the company support employees who want to grow into leadership roles?'

**My go-to question (works every time):**
'If I were to join your team, what would you want me to accomplish in the first 6 months to make you feel like hiring me was the right decision?'

**Why this question is great:**
- Shows you're already thinking about results
- Gives you clear expectations
- Makes you sound proactive and goal-oriented

**How many questions should you ask?**
Prepare 5-6 questions. You'll use 2-3 depending on time.

Don't ask just to ask. Be genuinely curious."

---

#### Bonus: Common Veteran-Specific Questions (9:15-11:00)
"Let's cover some questions you'll get specifically because you're a veteran.

---

**Question 1: 'Why are you leaving the military?'**

**Bad answer:**
'I'm tired of the military lifestyle. I don't want to deploy anymore. I want more freedom.'

**Why this fails:**
- Sounds negative
- Sounds like you're running away from something
- Employer worries you might not adjust to civilian work

**Good answer:**
'I'm incredibly proud of my military service, and it taught me skills that I'm excited to apply in the civilian sector. After 8 years, I'm ready for a new challenge and want to focus on building a long-term career in [industry]. I'm particularly interested in this role because it aligns with my background in [relevant skill].'

---

**Question 2: 'How will you adjust to civilian work culture?'**

**Bad answer:**
'I don't know, I've only worked in the military. I guess I'll figure it out.'

**Why this fails:**
- Sounds unprepared
- Employer worries you won't fit in

**Good answer:**
'That's a great question. I've actually been preparing for this transition by networking with veterans who've successfully made the shift, and I've learned that the key is communication and flexibility. I understand that civilian workplaces operate differently—more collaboration, less hierarchy, more autonomy. I'm excited about that. I've always been adaptable, and I'm confident I'll adjust quickly, especially with a supportive team.'

---

**Question 3: 'Do you have any PTSD or issues we should be concerned about?'**

**Note:** This question is technically illegal under the ADA, but some interviewers ask it indirectly.

**If asked directly:**
You can decline to answer: 'I'm not comfortable discussing my medical history, but I can assure you I'm fully capable of performing the duties of this role.'

**If asked indirectly ('How do you handle stress?'):**

**Good answer:**
'I've worked in high-stress environments for years, and I've developed strong coping mechanisms—staying organized, prioritizing tasks, taking breaks when needed, and communicating proactively with my team. I've never had stress interfere with my work performance.'

---

**Question 4: 'Can you take direction from someone younger or less experienced than you?'**

**Bad answer:**
'Yeah, I guess. It might be weird, but I'll deal with it.'

**Good answer:**
'Absolutely. In the military, leadership isn't always about age or time in service—it's about skills and responsibility. I've worked with people younger than me who had expertise I didn't, and I respected their knowledge. What matters to me is whether someone is competent and has the team's best interest in mind. Age and experience level don't matter to me as long as we're all working toward the same goal.'

---

**Question 5: 'What's your biggest weakness?'**

**Bad answer:**
'I don't have any weaknesses.' or 'I'm a perfectionist.' (Everyone says this)

**Good answer:**
'Early in my career, I struggled with delegating tasks because I wanted to make sure everything was done perfectly. Over time, I learned that micromanaging actually slows things down and prevents my team from growing. Now I focus on setting clear expectations, trusting my team, and being available for support when needed. It's something I continue to work on, but I've made significant progress.'

**Why this works:**
- Real weakness (not a humblebrag)
- Shows self-awareness
- Shows growth and improvement"
