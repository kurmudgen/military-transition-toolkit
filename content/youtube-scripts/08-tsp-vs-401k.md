### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"When I separated from the military, I had $45,000 in my TSP account. A financial advisor told me to roll it over to an IRA. I almost did it—until I looked at the fees and realized it would have cost me over $100,000 by retirement.

Let me show you the pros and cons of TSP vs 401K, and what I wish I'd known before making my decision."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:50)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and today we're talking about one of the biggest financial decisions you'll make when you separate: What do you do with your TSP?

**Your options when you leave the military:**
1. Keep your TSP (do nothing)
2. Roll it over to your civilian employer's 401(k)
3. Roll it over to an IRA
4. Withdraw it (almost always a bad idea)

**What we're covering:**
- What TSP actually is
- Comparison: TSP vs 401(k) vs IRA
- Fees breakdown (this is where it gets shocking)
- When to keep TSP
- When to roll over
- My personal decision and why

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a financial advisor. This is educational content based on my research and experience. Talk to a certified financial planner before making major financial decisions.

Let's start with the basics."

#### What is TSP? (0:50-2:00)
"TSP stands for Thrift Savings Plan—it's the military and federal government's retirement savings plan.

**Think of it like:**
The military version of a 401(k)

**Key features:**
- You contribute pre-tax dollars (Traditional TSP) or after-tax dollars (Roth TSP)
- Government may match contributions (up to 5% if you're active duty under BRS, or if you're a federal employee)
- Money grows tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth)
- You can't withdraw without penalty until age 59½ (with some exceptions)

**Investment options in TSP:**
The TSP has 5 main funds:
- **G Fund** - Government securities (very safe, low return)
- **F Fund** - Fixed income bonds
- **C Fund** - Tracks S&P 500 (large cap stocks)
- **S Fund** - Small/mid cap stocks
- **I Fund** - International stocks

Plus **L Funds** (Lifecycle funds) that automatically adjust based on your target retirement date.

**When you separate:**
Your TSP doesn't disappear. It stays there. You just can't contribute to it anymore (unless you become a federal civilian employee).

Now let's compare it to a civilian 401(k)."

---

#### TSP vs 401(k): The Comparison (2:00-5:00)

**Feature #1: Fees**

**TSP fees:**
- **Expense ratio:** 0.045% (that's $0.45 per $1,000 invested per year)
- This is one of the lowest expense ratios in the entire investment industry

**401(k) fees:**
- **Expense ratio:** Typically 0.50% - 1.50% (some are even higher)
- **Average:** About 0.90%

**Let's do the math on a $100,000 portfolio over 30 years:**

**TSP at 0.045% fees:**
- Annual fee: $45
- Over 30 years with 7% growth: $761,226
- Total fees paid: ~$15,000

**401(k) at 0.90% fees:**
- Annual fee: $900
- Over 30 years with 7% growth: $612,595
- Total fees paid: ~$148,000

**Difference: $148,631**

Just by having lower fees, TSP could make you $150,000 richer by retirement.

**Winner: TSP by a landslide**

---

**Feature #2: Investment Options**

**TSP investment options:**
- 5 basic funds (G, F, C, S, I)
- L Funds (target date)
- That's it—10 funds total

**401(k) investment options:**
- Depends on your employer
- Could be 10 funds, could be 100+
- Often includes mutual funds, index funds, target date funds
- Some 401(k)s offer brokerage windows (access to thousands of stocks/ETFs)

**Pros of TSP's limited options:**
- Simple, hard to mess up
- Low-cost index funds
- No analysis paralysis

**Cons of TSP's limited options:**
- Can't invest in specific sectors (tech, healthcare, etc.)
- Can't buy individual stocks
- Limited international exposure (I Fund doesn't include emerging markets)

**Winner: Depends on your preference**
- If you want simplicity: TSP
- If you want control and variety: 401(k)

---

**Feature #3: Employer Match**

**TSP (while active duty):**
- If you're under the Blended Retirement System (BRS): 5% match
- If you're under the old retirement system: No match

**401(k) (civilian employer):**
- Depends entirely on employer
- Average: 3-6% match
- Some companies don't match at all
- Some companies offer profit sharing on top of match

**Important note about TSP after separation:**
Once you leave the military, you can't contribute to TSP anymore (unless you become a federal civilian employee). So no more matching contributions.

**Your civilian 401(k) might offer:**
- 4% match
- Profit sharing
- Vesting schedule (you have to stay X years to keep the match)

**Winner: Depends on your civilian employer**

---

**Feature #4: Loans**

**TSP loans:**
- You can borrow up to 50% of your vested balance (max $50,000)
- You pay yourself back with interest
- If you separate and don't pay it back, it's treated as a taxable distribution

**401(k) loans:**
- Similar rules (50% of balance, up to $50,000)
- Must pay back within 5 years (or when you leave the company)
- If you leave your job, often must repay within 60 days

**Winner: Tie**
Both allow loans, but both have risks. Generally, avoid taking loans from retirement accounts if possible.

---

**Feature #5: Withdrawal Rules**

**TSP withdrawals:**
- Age 59½ for penalty-free withdrawals (unless you qualify for exceptions)
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) start at age 73
- Can set up monthly payments, annual payments, or lump sum

**401(k) withdrawals:**
- Same age 59½ rule
- Same RMD rules
- Flexibility depends on the plan

**Special TSP rule:**
If you separate from service in the year you turn 55 or later, you can withdraw from TSP without the 10% early withdrawal penalty.

**Winner: Slight edge to TSP for the age 55 rule**"

---

#### TSP vs IRA (5:00-6:30)
"Let's also compare TSP to an IRA since that's another rollover option.

**IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
- You open it yourself (not through an employer)
- Two types: Traditional IRA (pre-tax) and Roth IRA (after-tax)
- Contribution limit: $7,000/year (2024), $8,000 if age 50+

**TSP vs IRA comparison:**

**Fees:**
- TSP: 0.045%
- IRA: Depends where you open it
  - Vanguard/Fidelity index funds: 0.04% - 0.20%
  - Actively managed funds: 0.50% - 1.50%
- **Winner: TSP or low-cost IRA (tie)**

**Investment options:**
- TSP: 10 funds total
- IRA: Thousands of options (stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, REITs, etc.)
- **Winner: IRA**

**Contribution limits:**
- TSP: $23,000/year (2024) while you're contributing
- IRA: $7,000/year
- **Winner: TSP** (but you can't contribute after separation unless you're a fed employee)

**Protection from creditors:**
- TSP: Strong federal protection
- IRA: State-dependent protection (usually good, but varies)
- **Winner: TSP**

**Access to funds:**
- TSP: Age 59½ (or 55 if separated)
- IRA: Age 59½ (some exceptions)
- **Winner: Slight edge to TSP**

**Why people roll over to an IRA:**
- Want more investment options
- Want to consolidate multiple retirement accounts
- Want to work with a specific financial advisor
- Want to do backdoor Roth conversions (advanced strategy)"

#### When to KEEP Your TSP (6:30-8:00)
"Here's when keeping your TSP makes sense:

**Reason #1: You value low fees**
TSP has some of the lowest fees in the industry. If fees matter to you (and they should), keeping TSP is a no-brainer.

**Reason #2: You like simplicity**
10 funds. That's it. You don't need to research hundreds of investment options. The C Fund tracks the S&P 500. The L Funds are set-it-and-forget-it target date funds.

**Reason #3: Your civilian 401(k) has high fees**
If your new employer's 401(k) charges 1%+ in fees, do NOT roll your TSP into it. You'll lose a fortune over time.

**Reason #4: You might become a federal employee**
If there's any chance you'll work for the federal government (VA, USPS, DoD civilian, etc.), keep your TSP. You'll be able to contribute to it again and get matching.

**Reason #5: You want strong creditor protection**
TSP has federal protection from lawsuits and bankruptcy. If you're in a profession with high lawsuit risk, this matters.

**Reason #6: You're happy with the C, S, and I Fund mix**
These three funds give you broad exposure to US and international stocks. For most people, a mix of C, S, and I funds is a solid retirement strategy.

**My decision:**
I kept my TSP. Here's why:
- Fees are unbeatable
- I don't need 100 investment options
- My civilian 401(k) has higher fees (0.75%)
- I'm contributing to my 401(k) to get the employer match, but I left my TSP alone to grow

**My strategy:**
- Kept $45K in TSP (C Fund and S Fund allocation)
- Contribute to civilian 401(k) to get full employer match
- Also max out a Roth IRA ($7K/year)

This gives me diversification across accounts while keeping the low TSP fees."

---

#### When to ROLL OVER Your TSP (8:00-9:30)
"Here's when rolling over your TSP might make sense:

**Reason #1: You want more investment options**
If you're a hands-on investor who wants to invest in specific sectors, individual stocks, or alternative investments, TSP is too limiting.

**Reason #2: You want to consolidate accounts**
If you have multiple retirement accounts (old 401(k)s from previous jobs, IRAs, TSP), consolidating them into one IRA can simplify management.

**Reason #3: You want personalized financial advice**
Some people want to work with a financial advisor who manages their entire portfolio. You can't give a financial advisor direct control of your TSP, but you can with an IRA.

**Reason #4: You're doing advanced tax strategies**
Backdoor Roth IRA conversions, Roth conversion ladders, and other advanced strategies are easier with an IRA than TSP.

**Reason #5: Your civilian 401(k) is actually better**
Some employers (especially large tech companies) have excellent 401(k) plans with:
- Low fees (competitive with TSP)
- Great investment options
- Additional benefits (free financial advice, brokerage windows, etc.)

If your civilian 401(k) has fees under 0.10% and great options, rolling over might make sense for consolidation.

**Important: Where to roll over**

If you decide to roll over, DO NOT roll over to:
- High-fee financial advisors (1%+ annual fees)
- Whole life insurance products disguised as retirement accounts
- Annuities with high fees and surrender charges

**Good rollover options:**
- Vanguard (low-cost index funds)
- Fidelity (low-cost, good platform)
- Schwab (low-cost, good customer service)
- Your employer's 401(k) (if it's low-fee and high-quality)

**Process to roll over:**
1. Open an IRA or confirm your 401(k) accepts rollovers
2. Contact TSP (1-877-968-3778 or tsp.gov)
3. Request a direct rollover (this avoids taxes and penalties)
4. TSP will send a check directly to your new account
5. Confirm receipt within 60 days"

#### When to WITHDRAW Your TSP (Spoiler: Almost Never) (9:30-10:30)
"Let's talk about the worst option: cashing out your TSP.

**When you cash out:**
- You pay income tax on the entire amount (Traditional TSP)
- You pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're under age 59½
- You lose decades of compound growth

**Example:**
You have $40,000 in TSP. You're 28 years old. You cash it out.

**What happens:**
- $40,000 withdrawal
- Minus 22% federal income tax: -$8,800
- Minus 10% early withdrawal penalty: -$4,000
- Minus state tax (varies): -$2,000 (estimated)
- **You get: $25,200**

**What you lost:**
- That $40,000 could have grown to $430,000 by age 65 (7% annual growth)
- You just gave up $405,000 to get $25,000 today

**When cashing out might make sense (extremely rare):**
- You're facing foreclosure or eviction and have no other option
- You have life-threatening medical bills
- You've exhausted all other options (loans, hardship withdrawals, family help, etc.)

**Better alternatives:**
- TSP loan (borrow from yourself)
- Hardship withdrawal from TSP (if you qualify)
- Personal loan
- Ask family for help
- Side hustle to earn extra money

**Bottom line: Don't cash out your TSP. Just don't.**"

### Common Questions (10:30-11:30)
"Let me answer the most common questions I get:

**Q: Can I contribute to TSP after I separate?**
A: No, unless you become a federal civilian employee.

**Q: Can I have both TSP and a 401(k)?**
A: Yes! You can keep your TSP and contribute to a civilian 401(k). That's what I do.

**Q: What if I have both Traditional and Roth TSP?**
A: You can keep both or roll them over separately. Roth TSP can roll to Roth IRA, Traditional TSP can roll to Traditional IRA or 401(k).

**Q: How do I check my TSP balance?**
A: Log into your account at tsp.gov

**Q: Can I still change my TSP allocation after I separate?**
A: Yes! You can log in anytime and change how your money is invested.

**Q: Should I move everything to the G Fund when I separate?**
A: No! The G Fund is ultra-conservative. Unless you're retiring soon, you should stay invested in C, S, and I funds for growth.

**Q: What's the best TSP allocation?**
A: Depends on your age and risk tolerance. A common strategy:
- Under 40: 70% C Fund, 20% S Fund, 10% I Fund
- 40-50: 60% C, 20% S, 10% I, 10% F
- 50-60: 50% C, 15% S, 10% I, 25% F/G
- Or just use an L Fund based on your retirement year"

---

### My Recommendation (11:30-12:15)
"Here's my general advice for most veterans:

**Default strategy: Keep your TSP**

Unless you have a specific reason to roll it over, just keep it. The fees are unbeatable, the funds are solid, and you can always change your mind later.

**Contribute to your civilian 401(k) too:**
- Get the full employer match (free money)
- Max it out if you can ($23,000/year contribution limit)

**Also consider opening a Roth IRA:**
- Contribute $7,000/year
- Tax-free growth
- More investment options than TSP

**My personal setup:**
- $50K in TSP (staying there, invested in C and S Funds)
- Contributing to civilian 401(k) (getting 6% match)
- Maxing Roth IRA ($7,000/year)
- Emergency fund in high-yield savings

**Bottom line:**
Don't overthink it. Keep your TSP, contribute to your 401(k), open a Roth IRA. You'll be in great shape for retirement."

---

### RECAP (12:15-12:45)
"Quick recap:

**TSP pros:** Ultra-low fees, simple, strong protection
**TSP cons:** Limited investment options

**401(k) pros:** Employer match, more options
**401(k) cons:** Usually higher fees

**When to keep TSP:** If you value low fees and simplicity (most people)
**When to roll over:** If you want more control or your 401(k) is better

**Never cash out your TSP unless it's a true emergency**

**My advice:** Keep your TSP, contribute to your 401(k) for the match, and open a Roth IRA"
