### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:50)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and look—the transition from military to civilian life is expensive enough. Moving, new work clothes, maybe going back to school. You don't need to be spending money on tools and resources that are available for free.

**What we're covering today:**
10 free tools divided into categories:
- Resume & job search tools
- Education & training resources
- Benefits & financial tools
- Healthcare & wellness resources

**Important:**
When I say 'free,' I mean actually free. No 'free trials' that charge you after 30 days. These are legitimately free resources, often created specifically for veterans.

Let's start with the tools you'll use first—resume and job search."
