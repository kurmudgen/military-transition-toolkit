### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"Your VA disability claim just got denied. You're frustrated, maybe angry, and you're thinking 'They don't care about veterans.' But here's the truth—most denied claims aren't denied because the VA doesn't believe you. They're denied because of missing documentation, improper evidence, or simple mistakes you can fix.

Let me show you the seven things that are probably missing from your claim."

[Serious tone] "And stick around for number six—it's the one mistake I see in almost every denied claim."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:50)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and before we dive in, I need to say this: I'm not a VSO, I'm not a lawyer, and this isn't legal advice. But I am a veteran who went through two denials before finally getting a rating, and I've helped dozens of buddies navigate this process.

**Important disclaimer:**
If your claim was denied, you absolutely should work with a Veterans Service Officer or an accredited attorney. They're free through organizations like the DAV, VFW, or American Legion. What I'm sharing today is what I wish someone had told me before I submitted my first claim.

Alright, let's break down the seven most common reasons claims get denied—and more importantly, how to fix them."

---

#### Reason #1: No Nexus Letter (0:50-2:30)
"Reason number one: **You're missing a nexus letter.**

**What is a nexus letter?**
It's a letter from a doctor that says, 'In my medical opinion, [Veteran's Name]'s [condition] is at least as likely as not related to their military service.'

That phrase—'at least as likely as not'—is the magic language. It means there's a 50% or greater chance your condition is service-connected.

**Why claims get denied without it:**
Let's say you're claiming tinnitus (ringing in the ears). You were an artilleryman, you have tinnitus now, seems pretty obvious, right?

Wrong. The VA needs a medical professional to connect the dots. They need someone to say, 'This veteran was exposed to loud noise during service, and that exposure caused or aggravated their current tinnitus.'

**How to get a nexus letter:**
1. **Ask your private doctor** - If you have a civilian doctor who's been treating you, ask them to write a nexus letter. Give them your service records showing noise exposure.

2. **Use a DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire)** - These are VA forms that doctors fill out. Your doctor can complete the relevant DBQ and include their opinion on service connection.

3. **Hire a private medical examiner** - This costs money ($500-$1500 typically), but if you've been denied and you know your condition is service-connected, it can be worth it.

**Real example:**
My buddy claimed lower back pain. Denied. Why? No nexus letter. He got one from his chiropractor that said, 'Patient's lumbar strain is at least as likely as not caused by repetitive heavy lifting during his time as a combat engineer.' Submitted it with his appeal. Approved at 20%.

Don't skip this step."

#### Reason #2: Insufficient Service Records (2:30-4:00)
"Reason number two: **Your service records don't show the injury or event.**

**The VA's logic:**
If it's not documented in your service records, it's hard to prove it happened.

**Common scenarios:**

**Scenario A: You got hurt but never went to sick call**
Maybe you tweaked your knee on a ruck march but you just toughed it out. Now you're claiming knee pain, but there's zero documentation during service.

**How to fix it:**
- **Buddy statements** - Get signed, notarized statements from people who served with you who witnessed the injury or heard you complain about it
- **Personal statements** - Write your own detailed statement about when and how the injury occurred
- **Any documentation** - Training logs, deployment records, unit histories that show you were in situations where the injury likely occurred

**Scenario B: Your service medical records are incomplete**
This happens a lot. Records get lost, digitization misses things, or you served in an era where record-keeping was spotty.

**How to fix it:**
- Request your complete personnel file (not just medical records)
- Check if there are any unit records that mention medical treatment
- File a Notice of Disagreement stating that your records are incomplete

**Real example:**
Veteran claims PTSD from combat deployment. Denied because his service records show no mental health treatment during service. He submitted:
- Buddy statements from three team members describing his symptoms during deployment
- Unit deployment records showing combat operations
- His own statement detailing specific events

Claim approved on appeal."

#### Reason #3: C&P Exam Issues (4:00-5:45)
"Reason number three: **Problems with your Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam.**

**What is a C&P exam?**
After you file a claim, the VA often schedules you for an exam with one of their contracted doctors. This exam is critical—it can make or break your claim.

**Common C&P mistakes:**

**Mistake #1: You downplayed your symptoms**
Listen, I get it. We're trained to tough it out, to not complain. But the C&P exam is NOT the time for that. If your knee hurts every single day, say that. If you can't sleep more than 3 hours a night because of nightmares, say that.

**Mistake #2: You didn't prepare**
Go into that exam with a written list of:
- All your symptoms
- How often they occur
- How they affect your daily life
- Medications you're taking
- Treatments you've tried

**Mistake #3: The examiner didn't review your records**
This happens. The examiner says, 'I don't see evidence of service connection' because they didn't actually read your file.

**How to protect yourself:**
- Bring a copy of your entire claim file to the exam
- Bring your nexus letter
- Bring buddy statements
- Take notes during the exam
- If the examiner seems rushed or dismissive, document it

**After the exam:**
Request a copy of the C&P exam report. If it's inaccurate, you can submit a statement correcting any errors.

**Real talk:**
Some C&P examiners are great. Some are not. Some are actively hostile to veterans. If your examiner was terrible and your claim gets denied, you can request a new exam. Talk to your VSO about this."

---

#### Reason #4: Filing for the Wrong Condition (5:45-7:00)
"Reason number four: **You filed for the wrong condition or used the wrong terminology.**

**Example:**
You're having trouble sleeping, anxiety, nightmares from deployment. You file a claim for 'anxiety.'

Denied.

Why? Because what you actually have is PTSD, and the diagnostic criteria for PTSD are different than general anxiety disorder.

**Another example:**
You file for 'knee pain.' But the VA needs specifics:
- Is it degenerative arthritis?
- Is it a meniscus tear?
- Is it patellofemoral syndrome?

**How to fix this:**

**Step 1: Get a proper diagnosis**
See a doctor. Get the actual medical diagnosis. Don't guess.

**Step 2: File for the specific condition**
Use the medical terminology from your diagnosis.

**Step 3: If needed, file multiple conditions**
You can file for both knee arthritis AND meniscus tear if both are present.

**Pro tip:**
When in doubt, work with a VSO. They know the proper terminology and the proper way to categorize conditions."

---

#### Reason #5: No Continuity of Treatment (7:00-8:15)
"Reason number five: **You haven't been getting treatment.**

**Here's the hard truth:**
If you're claiming a condition is disabling, but you haven't seen a doctor about it in three years, the VA is going to question how severe it really is.

**The VA's logic:**
'If this condition is so bad that it deserves a disability rating, why aren't you getting medical care for it?'

**I know what you're thinking:**
'I can't afford treatment!' or 'The VA wait times are too long!'

**Here's what you need to do:**

**Establish a treatment record:**
- Use VA healthcare if you're eligible
- Use community care if VA wait times are too long
- See your private doctor and keep all records
- Even if all you can do is go to urgent care when it flares up—document it

**Why this matters:**
The VA looks at:
- Frequency of treatment
- Current severity of symptoms
- Whether your condition is getting worse, staying the same, or improving

If you have zero medical records from the last few years, your claim is at risk.

**Exception:**
If you legitimately can't access healthcare, submit a personal statement explaining why you haven't been able to get treatment."

---

#### Reason #6: You Missed the Appeals Deadline (8:15-9:30)
"Reason number six, and this is the big one: **You missed the appeals deadline.**

**Listen carefully:**
When you get a decision letter from the VA, you have **one year** to file an appeal or submit new evidence to get your effective date protected.

If you miss that deadline, you can still reopen the claim, but your effective date starts over—meaning you could lose years of back pay.

**What to do when you get a denial letter:**

**Within 1 year:**
1. **File a Supplemental Claim** if you have new evidence (like a nexus letter)
2. **Request a Higher-Level Review** if you think the VA made an error
3. **Appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals** if you disagree with the decision

**Don't just ignore the letter.**
I've seen veterans throw away denial letters in frustration, then try to refile three years later and lose tens of thousands in back pay.

**Work with a VSO:**
Seriously. They'll track your deadlines and make sure you don't miss anything.

**Real example:**
Veteran denied for sleep apnea in 2019. Ignored the letter. Refiled in 2022 with new evidence. Claim approved, but effective date is 2022, not 2019. Lost $50,000 in back pay.

Don't let this be you."

#### Reason #7: Incomplete Personal Statement (9:30-10:45)
"Reason number seven: **Your personal statement was weak or missing.**

**What is a personal statement?**
It's your opportunity to tell your story in your own words. It should explain:
- What happened during service
- How it affects you now
- How it impacts your daily life

**Bad personal statement:**
'I hurt my back in the military. It hurts a lot. Please approve my claim.'

**Good personal statement:**
'In March 2018, while deployed to Afghanistan, I fell off the back of a HMMWV during a convoy operation and injured my lower back. I reported to the battalion aid station and was given ibuprofen and told to rest. Since separation in 2020, I experience daily lower back pain rated 6-7 out of 10. I cannot stand for more than 20 minutes without needing to sit. I can no longer run or do physical activities I used to enjoy. I take ibuprofen daily and see a chiropractor twice a month. This condition significantly impacts my ability to work and care for my family.'

**See the difference?**

**What to include:**
- Specific dates and locations
- Specific events that caused the condition
- Specific symptoms you experience
- Specific ways it affects your life
- Specific treatments you've tried

Be detailed. Be honest. Be specific."

### RECAP (10:45-11:30)
"Alright, let's recap the seven reasons VA claims get denied:

1. **No nexus letter** - Get a medical opinion linking your condition to service
2. **Insufficient service records** - Use buddy statements and personal statements
3. **C&P exam issues** - Prepare, don't downplay, and review the report
4. **Wrong condition filed** - Get a proper diagnosis and use medical terminology
5. **No continuity of treatment** - Establish a treatment record
6. **Missed appeals deadline** - You have one year to act on a denial
7. **Weak personal statement** - Be specific and detailed

**If you got denied:**
Don't give up. Most successful claims take multiple attempts. The VA isn't your enemy—the system is just complicated and bureaucratic.

**Next steps:**
1. Get a copy of your C-file (claims file)
2. Work with a VSO
3. Figure out which of these seven issues applies to you
4. Fix it and resubmit"
