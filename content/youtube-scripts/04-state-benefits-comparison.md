### HOOK (0:00-0:20)
"Where you live after the military could be worth tens of thousands of dollars in benefits. Some states will pay for your entire college degree, give you property tax exemptions, and let you keep 100% of your military retirement pay. Other states? They'll tax everything.

I'm going to break down the top five states for veterans in 2025, plus how to figure out which state is actually best for YOUR situation."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:20-1:00)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and full transparency—I'm based in [your state], but I've done the research on all 50 states because this is one of the most important financial decisions you'll make after separation.

**Important note:**
There's no such thing as a 'best state' for everyone. It depends on:
- Your disability rating
- Whether you're using education benefits
- If you're getting military retirement pay
- Your family situation
- Job opportunities in your field

So today I'm giving you the data, and we'll talk about how to evaluate what matters most to you.

Let's start with the top five overall states, then we'll break down specific categories."

#### The Top 5 States Overall (1:00-2:30)
"Based on a combination of factors—taxes, education benefits, healthcare, employment, and quality of life—here are the top five states for veterans in 2025:

**#5: Virginia**
**#4: Texas**
**#3: Florida**
**#2: South Dakota**
**#1: Alaska**

Now before you start packing for Alaska, let me break down WHY these made the list and what each state actually offers. Because again, Alaska might not be the best choice for you specifically."

---

#### Category #1: Tax-Friendly States (2:30-4:30)
"Let's start with the biggest financial factor: **Taxes.**

**States with NO state income tax (9 total):**
1. Alaska
2. Florida
3. Nevada
4. South Dakota
5. Tennessee
6. Texas
7. Washington
8. Wyoming
9. New Hampshire (no tax on wages, but taxes interest/dividends)

**What this means:**
If you're receiving military retirement pay, you get to keep 100% of it. No state taking a cut.

**Example:**
Let's say you retire as an E-7 with 20 years—your retirement pay is roughly $2,500/month or $30,000/year.

- In California (13.3% top tax rate): You'd pay up to $4,000/year in state taxes on that retirement income
- In Texas (no state income tax): You pay $0

Over 20 years of retirement, that's $80,000+ difference.

**States that DON'T tax military retirement (even though they have state income tax):**
This list is longer—about 30 states offer some form of military retirement exemption:
- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin

**Important distinctions:**

Some states fully exempt military retirement. Others have:
- Partial exemptions (exempt first $X amount)
- Age requirements (must be 55+)
- Years of service requirements (must have 20+ years)

**States that DO tax military retirement:**
Watch out for these if you're getting retirement pay:
- California
- Georgia (partial exemption)
- Montana
- Oregon
- Vermont
- Virginia (partial exemption)

**Other tax considerations:**

**Property tax:**
- Some states offer property tax exemptions for disabled veterans (varies by disability rating)
- Texas: 100% disabled veterans get 100% property tax exemption
- Florida: 100% disabled veterans get complete homestead exemption

**Sales tax:**
- Ranges from 0% (Oregon, New Hampshire, Montana, Alaska, Delaware) to 7%+ in other states
- Consider this if you have a large family or high consumption"

#### Category #2: Education Benefits (4:30-6:30)

- New York: NYS Health Care for Veterans program

---

#### Category #4: Employment Opportunities (7:45-9:00)

**Factors considered:**

**Top states for veteran hiring preference:**
- California, Florida, New York, Texas, Ohio

**Pro tip:**
Research job markets in your specific field, not just overall veteran unemployment. A state might have low veteran unemployment but no jobs in your industry."

#### Category #5: Quality of Life & Veteran Community (9:00-10:15)
"Category five: **Quality of life and veteran community.**

This is subjective, but here are factors to consider:

**States with the largest veteran populations (you'll find community):**
1. California: 1.6 million veterans
2. Texas: 1.5 million
3. Florida: 1.5 million
4. Pennsylvania: 800,000+
5. New York: 750,000+

**States with the highest percentage of population being veterans:**
1. Alaska: 10%
2. Virginia: 8.9%
3. Montana: 9.3%
4. Maine: 9%
5. Wyoming: 9.6%

**Why this matters:**
- More veteran-owned businesses
- Better understanding from community
- More veteran events and networking opportunities
- Easier to find mentors who've done the transition

**Cost of living considerations:**

**Most affordable states for veterans:**
- South Dakota (low cost of living, no state income tax)
- Tennessee (low cost of living, no state income tax)
- Alabama (affordable housing, good benefits)
- Oklahoma (low cost, property tax exemptions)

**Most expensive (but may be worth it for opportunities):**
- California (high cost, but great weather and VA education benefits)
- New York (high cost, but strong job market and benefits)
- Hawaii (very high cost, but paradise)

**Housing affordability:**
Compare median home prices:
- West Virginia: $145,000 median
- California: $700,000+ median
- Texas: $300,000 median
- Florida: $400,000 median

With a VA home loan (0% down, no PMI), housing affordability becomes more manageable."

#### How to Choose YOUR Best State (10:15-11:30)
"Okay, so with all that data, how do you actually decide?

**Step 1: Identify your top 3 priorities**

Examples:
- 'No state income tax' (narrows to 9 states)
- 'Close to family' (might override all other factors)
- 'Free college for my kids' (look at Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin)
- 'Warm weather year-round' (Florida, Texas, Arizona, Southern California)
- 'Job opportunities in cybersecurity' (Virginia, Maryland, Colorado, Texas)

**Step 2: Use this scorecard**

Rate each state you're considering (1-10 scale):
- Tax burden
- Education benefits
- VA healthcare access
- Job opportunities in my field
- Cost of living
- Weather/climate preference
- Distance from family
- Veteran community

Add up the scores. Highest score wins.

**Step 3: Visit before you move**

Sounds obvious, but spend at least a week in the state:
- Drive around neighborhoods
- Visit the VA facility
- Check out job locations
- Talk to local veterans (find them on Facebook groups)

**Step 4: Use the tools**

- Military.com State Benefits Directory
- Veterans United State-by-State Guide
- MOAA State Guide
- And I've built a comparison tool at militarytransitiontoolkit.com where you can filter by your priorities

**Real talk:**
Sometimes the 'best' state on paper isn't best for you. I know veterans who moved to Texas for the benefits, hated the heat, and moved back home within a year.

Don't underestimate the value of being near family and friends. That support network is worth more than tax savings sometimes."
