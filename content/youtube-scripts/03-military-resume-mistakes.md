## SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"I applied to 87 jobs with my military resume and got exactly two callbacks. Then I fixed these five mistakes, and my interview rate jumped to 1 in every 5 applications.

Let me show you the exact mistakes that are killing your chances—and more importantly, how to fix them in the next hour."

[Hold up two versions of resume] "Same experience. Completely different results."

### MAIN CONTENT

#### Introduction (0:15-0:45)
"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], Army veteran, and today we're talking about the brutal truth: your military resume is probably hurting you more than helping you.

And look, it's not your fault. Nobody teaches us how to translate our experience for civilian hiring managers who've never served. But the good news is, these mistakes are easy to fix once you know what to look for.

So let's go through the five biggest resume killers I see from veterans, with real examples and how to fix them right now."

---

#### Mistake #1: Military Jargon Overload (0:45-2:45)
"Mistake number one: **Your resume is full of military jargon.**

**Here's what I'm talking about:**

**Bad resume example:**
'Served as NCOIC of S-3 operations section. Coordinated with higher HHC for OPORD dissemination. Managed PERSTAT and SITREPS for BN CDR. Supervised PCC/PCI for platoon-level movements.'

[Pause] "If you're a civilian hiring manager, you just read that and thought 'What language is this?'

**Why this fails:**
Hiring managers spend an average of 6 seconds scanning your resume. If they have to Google what NCOIC means, they're moving on to the next applicant.

**How to fix it:**

**Step 1: Remove all acronyms**
- NCOIC → Operations Supervisor
- BN CDR → Battalion Commander → Senior Leadership
- PERSTAT → Personnel Status Reports
- SITREP → Situation Reports

**Step 2: Translate military tasks to civilian outcomes**

**Good resume example:**
'Operations Supervisor managing daily activities for 150-person organization. Coordinated communication between multiple departments to ensure timely project updates. Prepared and delivered status reports to senior leadership. Supervised quality control procedures for team movements and operations.'

**See the difference?**
Same job. Same skills. But one gets you interviews, and one gets you ignored.

**Quick test:**
Show your resume to someone who never served. If they have to ask what something means, change it.

**Tools to help:**
- Use the military skills translator (O*NET)
- Google '[your MOS] civilian resume'
- Ask ChatGPT: 'Translate this military experience to civilian language: [paste text]'

**Bottom line:**
If your resume has more than two acronyms on the entire page, you're probably overloading it. Cut them out."

#### Mistake #2: Duties Instead of Achievements (2:45-4:45)
"Mistake number two: **You're listing duties, not achievements.**

**This is huge.** Most military resumes read like a position description. They tell the hiring manager what your job was, not what you accomplished.

**Bad resume example:**
- Responsible for maintenance of five vehicles
- Conducted daily inspections
- Managed supply inventory
- Supervised team of 8 soldiers

**Why this fails:**
Every motor pool NCO has done these things. What makes you different? What impact did you have?

**How to fix it: Use the CAR method**

**C - Context:** What was the situation?
**A - Action:** What did YOU specifically do?
**R - Result:** What was the measurable outcome?

**Better resume example:**
- Reduced vehicle downtime by 35% through implementation of preventive maintenance tracking system
- Identified and resolved $50K in supply discrepancies during annual audit, preventing budget shortfall
- Trained and mentored team of 8, resulting in 100% promotion rate to next rank
- Streamlined daily inspection process, saving 2 hours per day in operational time

**See how much stronger that is?**

**Formula to remember:**
[Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [Measurable Result]

**Examples of strong action verbs:**
- Reduced, Increased, Improved, Streamlined, Implemented
- Led, Managed, Coordinated, Trained, Mentored
- Achieved, Delivered, Generated, Saved, Resolved

**Avoid weak phrases:**
- 'Responsible for...'
- 'Duties included...'
- 'Tasked with...'

**Numbers are your friend:**
Anytime you can add a number, do it:
- How many people did you supervise?
- What was the budget you managed?
- How much did you save or improve?
- What percentage increase/decrease did you achieve?

**Exercise:**
Take every bullet point on your resume and ask: 'So what? What was the impact?'

If you can't answer that, either add the impact or delete the bullet point."

#### Mistake #3: One Resume for Every Job (4:45-6:30)
"Mistake number three: **You're sending the same resume to every single job.**

**Real talk:**
I know it's tempting to have one 'master resume' that you blast out to every job opening. I did this too. And I got nowhere.

**Why this fails:**
Most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)—software that scans your resume for keywords before a human ever sees it. If your resume doesn't match the job description, it gets filtered out automatically.

**The stats:**
About 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS before a human reads them.

**How to fix it: Tailor your resume for each job**

**Step 1: Read the job description carefully**
Look for:
- Required skills
- Preferred qualifications
- Repeated keywords
- Specific software or tools mentioned

**Step 2: Mirror the language**

**Example:**
Job posting says: 'Seeking a project coordinator with experience in stakeholder management and cross-functional team collaboration.'

Your resume should include:
- 'Coordinated projects across multiple departments'
- 'Managed stakeholder communications and expectations'
- 'Led cross-functional teams to achieve project milestones'

**Step 3: Prioritize relevant experience**

Let's say you were an infantry team leader, and you're applying to two different jobs:

**Job A: Operations Manager**
Your resume should emphasize:
- Leadership of 12-person team
- Planning and executing operations
- Resource management
- Performance metrics

**Job B: Safety Manager**
Your resume should emphasize:
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Safety protocol enforcement
- Incident investigation
- Training team members on safety procedures

Same military experience, different emphasis.

**Pro tip:**
Create a 'master resume' with every accomplishment you've ever done. Then create customized versions for each application by selecting the most relevant bullets.

**Time saver:**
This sounds like a lot of work, but once you have your master resume, tailoring each version takes about 10-15 minutes. And it dramatically increases your callback rate.

**I went from:**
- Generic resume → 2% callback rate
- Tailored resume → 18% callback rate

That's worth 15 minutes per application."

#### Mistake #4: Ignoring the Summary Section (6:30-8:00)
"Mistake number four: **You don't have a professional summary, or it's terrible.**

**What I see on most veteran resumes:**
Either there's no summary at all, or it says something like:

'Dedicated military professional seeking opportunities in the civilian sector. Hard worker with strong leadership skills.'

**Why this fails:**
It's generic, vague, and tells the hiring manager nothing about what you actually do.

**Why the summary matters:**
Remember, hiring managers spend about 6 seconds on your resume. The summary is often the only thing they read. It needs to hook them immediately.

**How to write a strong summary:**

**Formula:**
[Your professional identity] with [X years] experience in [relevant areas]. Proven track record in [2-3 key skills] with [specific achievement or credential]. Seeking to leverage [your strengths] to [add value] as [job title you're applying for].

**Bad example:**
'Military veteran with 6 years of experience looking for a new opportunity.'

**Good example:**
'Operations Manager with 6 years of military leadership experience managing teams of up to 40 personnel. Proven track record in logistics coordination, process improvement, and high-stakes decision-making under pressure. Reduced operational costs by 25% through strategic planning and resource optimization. Seeking to leverage operational expertise and leadership skills to drive efficiency as Operations Manager at [Company Name].'

**Breakdown:**
- Professional identity: Operations Manager
- Experience: 6 years
- Key skills: logistics, process improvement, decision-making
- Specific achievement: reduced costs by 25%
- Value proposition: drive efficiency
- Tailored to job: mentions the exact title

**Another example for a different field:**

'Project Coordinator with 8 years of military experience in communications and technology systems. Skilled in project planning, stakeholder management, and cross-functional collaboration. Successfully managed 15+ simultaneous projects with 100% on-time delivery. Seeking to apply organizational and technical skills as Project Coordinator at [Company Name].'

**Pro tip:**
Change the summary for every job application. Yes, every single one. It takes 3 minutes and dramatically improves your chances.

**Don't forget:**
If the job posting has certifications or skills requirements, mention them in your summary if you have them.

Example: 'PMP-certified Project Manager...' or 'Six Sigma Green Belt with expertise in...'"

#### Mistake #5: Bad Formatting and Length (8:00-9:30)
"Mistake number five: **Your resume formatting is either too fancy or too plain, and it's definitely too long.**

**Formatting mistakes I see:**

**Mistake A: The 'overly fancy' resume**
- Multiple colors
- Graphics and charts
- Headshot photo
- Fancy fonts

**Why this fails:**
ATS can't read most of this. Your resume gets scrambled or rejected. Plus, it looks unprofessional.

**Mistake B: The 'plain text wall'**
- No white space
- Tiny font
- No bold or italics for emphasis
- Everything runs together

**Why this fails:**
Nobody wants to read a wall of text. Hiring managers will skip it.

**How to fix your formatting:**

**Best practices:**

**1. Use a clean, ATS-friendly template**
- Simple layout with clear sections
- Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman
- Font size: 10-12 point
- Black text on white background
- No headers, footers, or text boxes (ATS can't read them)

**2. Create clear sections:**
- Professional Summary (at the top)
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Certifications (if relevant)
- Optional: Volunteer Work, Professional Development

**3. Use white space effectively**
- Margins: at least 0.5 inches
- Space between sections
- Bullet points, not paragraphs

**4. Bold and italics for emphasis**
- Bold: Job titles, company names
- Italics: Dates, locations
- Keep it consistent throughout

**Resume length:**

**Rule of thumb:**
- 0-10 years of experience: 1 page
- 10-20 years of experience: 2 pages max
- 20+ years: 2 pages max

**If your resume is 3+ pages:**
You're including too much. Hiring managers won't read it. Cut it down to the most relevant experience for the job you're applying to.

**What to cut:**
- Anything older than 15 years (unless extremely relevant)
- High school information (unless you have no college)
- Every single training course you've ever taken
- Unrelated jobs or experience

**What to keep:**
- Last 10-15 years of relevant experience
- Leadership roles
- Achievements with measurable results
- Relevant education and certifications

**Final test:**
Print your resume. Look at it from 5 feet away. Does it look clean and organized? Or does it look cluttered? If it looks cluttered from a distance, it needs work."
