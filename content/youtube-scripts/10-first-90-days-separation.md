"Hey everyone, I'm [Name], and today I'm sharing my honest experience from my first 90 days out of the military.

**What I'm covering:**
- Week-by-week breakdown of my first 90 days
- The things that went well
- The things that were harder than expected
- What I wish I'd known
- Advice for people about to separate

**Important note:**
Everyone's experience is different. Your transition might be easier or harder than mine. But I hope this gives you a realistic picture of what to expect.

Let's start with Day 1."

#### Week 1: The Honeymoon Phase (0:50-3:00)
"**Day 1-7: Freedom (and confusion)**

**What I expected:**
Wake up excited. Sleep in. Start my civilian job. Feel free.

**What actually happened:**

**Day 1:**
I woke up at 5:30 AM. Muscle memory. I wasn't going to PT, but my body didn't know that yet.

I looked at my phone. No work emails. No group texts about formations. Nothing.

It felt... weird.

**First realization:** I didn't know what to do with myself.

For 8 years, every day had structure. Wake up at 5:30, PT, shower, work by 8, meetings, taskings, go home. Even on weekends, there was always something military-related.

Now? Nothing.

**The good:**
- I took my kid to school for the first time in years (I was always at PT)
- I had coffee at 9 AM on a Tuesday (felt rebellious)
- No uniform, no shaving, no formations
- I started my civilian job on Day 3—smooth transition

**The hard:**
- Identity crisis hit immediately. I kept thinking 'I'm not a soldier anymore. So... what am I?'
- I missed the camaraderie. Nobody at my civilian job understood inside jokes or shared experiences
- I felt out of place in business casual attire
- My first team meeting felt awkward—I wasn't sure how to act

**What I wish I'd known:**
The first week is weird for everyone. You're going to feel lost. That's normal.

**Advice:**
- Give yourself grace. You're learning a new way of life.
- Don't expect to feel 'normal' right away
- Keep a routine—wake up at the same time, exercise, eat regular meals
- Connect with other veterans (Reddit, Facebook groups, local meetups)"

#### Week 2-4: The Adjustment Period (3:00-5:30)
"**Day 8-30: Reality sets in**

**What I expected:**
I'd adjust quickly. Work would be great. Life would be simple.

**What actually happened:**

**The work adjustment:**
My civilian job was going okay, but I made mistakes:
- I called my boss 'sir' multiple times (old habit)
- I showed up 15 minutes early to every meeting (apparently that's not normal?)
- I used way too much military jargon in emails
- I got frustrated when coworkers showed up late to meetings or half-assed projects

**Realization #2:** Civilian work culture is different.

In the military, if the standard is 0800, you show up at 0745. In civilian world, if the meeting is at 9 AM, people stroll in at 9:05 with coffee.

In the military, if the boss says 'I need this by Friday,' you deliver it by Thursday. In civilian world, Friday at 4:59 PM is acceptable.

This drove me crazy for weeks.

**The financial adjustment:**

**The good:**
- My civilian paycheck was bigger (no more military pay, but higher salary)
- No more moves, no more uncertainty about where I'd be stationed

**The hard:**
- Healthcare was confusing. I had to pick a plan during benefits enrollment and had no idea what I was doing
- I forgot to budget for things like:
  - Professional wardrobe (spent $600 on clothes)
  - Higher cost of living (military BAH was covering more than I realized)
  - Car maintenance (I was driving more for work)
- First paycheck was smaller than expected due to taxes and benefits deductions

**The emotional adjustment:**

This was the hardest part.

**Week 2:** I felt fine. Busy with work, excited about new life.

**Week 3:** I started feeling... empty. I didn't have a sense of purpose like I did in the military.

**Week 4:** I was irritable. My spouse asked if I was okay. I said yes. I was lying.

**What I didn't expect:**
I missed the military. Not all of it—I didn't miss the BS, the formations, the paperwork. But I missed:
- The mission
- The team
- Knowing exactly what my role was
- Feeling like I was part of something bigger

**What I wish I'd known:**
It's okay to miss the military even if you wanted to leave. Those feelings can coexist.

**Advice:**
- Find a mission in your civilian life (volunteer, side project, community involvement)
- Stay connected with veteran friends
- Talk to someone (therapist, VSO, veteran mentor) if you're struggling
- Give yourself time. One month is not enough to adjust to a decade of change."

#### Week 5-8: Finding My Rhythm (5:30-8:00)
"**Day 31-60: Things start clicking**

**What I expected:**
I'd be fully adjusted by now.

**What actually happened:**
I wasn't fully adjusted, but I was getting better.

**Work improvements:**
- Stopped calling people 'sir' and 'ma'am' (mostly)
- Learned to speak civilian (fewer acronyms, more context)
- Started building relationships with coworkers
- Got positive feedback from my boss on a project

**Realization #3:** I bring value that civilians don't have.

One day, we had a crisis at work—a major project was behind schedule, the client was angry, and our team was panicking.

I stayed calm. I'd dealt with way worse in the military.

I organized the team, created a plan, assigned tasks, and we fixed it.

My boss pulled me aside later and said, 'You're really good under pressure. Where'd you learn that?'

That's when I realized: my military experience was an asset, not something to hide.

**Financial improvements:**
- Set up a budget (finally)
- Opened a Roth IRA and started contributing
- Figured out my healthcare plan (picked the PPO)
- Paid off some debt

**Social improvements:**
- Joined a local veterans group—met once a month for coffee
- Started working out at a gym (needed that routine)
- Reconnected with old friends from my hometown

**Emotional improvements:**
- Felt more 'myself'
- Stopped feeling like an imposter at work
- Found purpose through volunteering (coached youth sports)
- Therapy helped (used my 12 free Military OneSource sessions)

**The hard parts (still):**
- I still woke up early (my body never adjusted)
- I still missed deployments sometimes (the adrenaline, the bond with my team)
- I felt disconnected from civilians who didn't understand military life
- I got frustrated when coworkers complained about minor inconveniences

**What I wish I'd known:**
Month 2 is when you start feeling human again. But you're still adjusting.

**Advice:**
- Find your people (veteran groups, hobby groups, work friends)
- Invest in yourself (certifications, gym membership, hobbies)
- Be patient. It takes 6-12 months to fully adjust."

#### Week 9-12: The Turning Point (8:00-10:30)
"**Day 61-90: This is my new life**

**What I expected:**
I'd have it all figured out by now.

**What actually happened:**
I didn't have it all figured out, but I had momentum.

**Work wins:**
- Got my first civilian job performance review—exceeded expectations
- Led a team meeting (felt like I was back in my element)
- Mentored a new hire (felt good to help someone)
- Started enjoying my work (finally)

**Financial wins:**
- Emergency fund: $5,000 saved
- Maxing out my 401(k) match
- Paid off $3,000 in credit card debt
- Started researching buying a house (VA loan)

**Personal wins:**
- Established a routine: wake up, gym, work, family time, hobbies
- Joined a weekly pickup basketball game (new social outlet)
- Took a weekend trip with my family (first time in years without military obligations)
- Felt genuinely happy

**Emotional breakthrough:**

Around Day 75, I had a moment.

I was sitting at my desk at work, and I realized: I'm not a soldier anymore. And that's okay.

For the first 60 days, I was mourning my old identity. I kept thinking 'I was a soldier. That's who I am.'

But around Day 75, I realized: I was a soldier. That shaped me. But it doesn't define me anymore.

Now I'm a [project manager / engineer / whatever]. I'm a dad who's home for dinner. I'm a veteran who can help others transition. I'm a civilian with skills and experience.

That shift in mindset changed everything.

**The hard parts (still):**
- I still had bad days where I missed the military
- I still got annoyed by civilian coworkers sometimes
- I still struggled with feeling 'soft' or 'lazy' for having a normal schedule
- I still felt like an outsider at work events

**What I wish I'd known:**
The 90-day mark is when you realize: you're going to be okay.

**Advice:**
- Redefine your identity. You're not 'just a veteran.' You're a veteran AND [your new role].
- Celebrate small wins (got through a week without military jargon? That's a win)
- Check in with yourself monthly—how's your mental health? Finances? Relationships?"

#### The Things Nobody Told Me (10:30-12:00)
"Let me share the things I wish someone had told me before I separated.

**1. You're going to grieve**
Leaving the military is like breaking up with a toxic ex you still love. You wanted to leave, but you still miss parts of it. That's normal.

**2. Civilians will never fully understand**
Your coworkers will try to relate ('Yeah, my last job was like the military, very strict!'). They mean well, but they don't get it. That's okay. Find veteran friends.

**3. You're going to feel behind**
Everyone your age has 8 years of civilian work experience. You have 8 years of military experience that doesn't always translate. You'll catch up. Be patient.

**4. Your spouse is adjusting too**
If you're married, your spouse is also adjusting to you being home, having a normal schedule, and being more available. Talk to them. Ask how they're feeling.

**5. You'll compare everything to the military**
'In the military, we would have done this faster/better/differently.' You'll say this a lot in your head. Eventually, you'll stop.

**6. Healthcare is complicated**
You'll spend hours figuring out insurance, copays, deductibles, in-network vs out-of-network. It sucks. Get help if you need it.

**7. You'll feel guilty**
Guilty for leaving. Guilty for not missing it more. Guilty for being happy. Guilty for struggling. All of it is normal.

**8. Some days you'll want to go back**
Some days you'll seriously consider re-enlisting. I've drafted that email to my old unit twice. I didn't send it. Give yourself time before making big decisions.

**9. Your mental health matters**
If you're struggling, get help. Military OneSource, VA healthcare, Vet Centers, private therapy. Don't tough it out.

**10. It gets better**
Day 30 is hard. Day 60 is better. Day 90 is manageable. Day 180 is normal. Give yourself time."

---

#### What I'd Do Differently (12:00-13:00)
"If I could do it all over again, here's what I'd change:

**1. Start therapy before I separated**
I waited until Week 4 to talk to someone. I should have started during terminal leave.

**2. Build my civilian network sooner**
I should have networked more during my last year of service. LinkedIn, informational interviews, veteran groups.

**3. Get more certifications**
I got one certification (PMP). I should have used SkillBridge or my last 6 months to get 2-3 more.

**4. Save more money**
I had $10K saved. I should have had $15K. Transition expenses added up fast.

**5. Set clearer expectations with my family**
I should have had a real conversation with my spouse about what transition would look like—for both of us.

**6. Join a veteran group immediately**
I waited until Week 6. I should have joined Day 1.

**7. Be more patient with myself**
I was hard on myself for struggling. I should have given myself grace."

### Where I Am Now (Day 90) (13:00-14:00)
"So where am I now, 90 days later?

**Professionally:**
- Doing well at my job
- Building skills and experience
- Considering a promotion in 6 months

**Financially:**
- Budget is solid
- Debt is decreasing
- Savings are growing
- Planning for the future (house, retirement, etc.)

**Personally:**
- Routine is established
- Mental health is good (therapy helped)
- Relationships are strong
- Hobbies are back (gym, sports, reading)

**Emotionally:**
- I don't miss the military as much
- I've accepted my new identity
- I'm proud of my service and excited about my future
- I'm helping other veterans transition (that's my new mission)

**Am I fully adjusted?**
No. I'd say I'm 70% there. I still have moments where I feel like an outsider. I still miss the military sometimes. But I'm okay with that.

**Would I do it again?**
Yes. Leaving was the right decision for me and my family. It was hard, but it was worth it.

**Final thought:**
If you're about to separate, know this: it's going to be hard. Harder than you think. But you're going to be okay. You've overcome harder things. This is just a different kind of challenge.

Give yourself time. Find your people. Build your routine. Ask for help when you need it.

You've got this."
