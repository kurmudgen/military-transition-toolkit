**Not Applying to Multiple Airlines:** The airline hiring process is competitive. Apply to multiple carriers simultaneously. Preferences vary, and different airlines have different hiring timelines.

**Expecting Immediate Seniority:** Airline pay and schedules are seniority-based. You'll start at the bottom regardless of military experience. Plan financially for lower initial pay and less desirable schedules.

**Ignoring Corporate Aviation:** Corporate flight attendant jobs often pay more than airlines and involve smaller passenger counts. Your military VIP experience is directly relevant.

**Not Researching Airline Culture:** Each airline has different culture, bases, and lifestyle implications. Research where you want to be based and what airline culture fits you.
