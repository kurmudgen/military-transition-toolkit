## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Getting APICS Certifications:** Military supply experience is valuable, but APICS certifications prove you speak the civilian supply chain language. CPIM or CSCP significantly improves your marketability.

**Undervaluing Your Experience:** You've managed complex supply chains with high accountability. Don't accept entry-level positions—target coordinator and analyst roles at minimum.

**Ignoring Data Analytics Skills:** Modern supply chain is data-driven. Highlight any experience with Excel, analytics, or supply system reporting. Consider learning Power BI or Tableau.

**Limiting to Defense Industry:** Your skills work in any industry. Retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and tech all need supply chain professionals. Explore beyond defense contractors.

**Not Learning ERP Systems:** SAP and Oracle are common corporate systems. Familiarize yourself with these platforms—many offer free learning resources.
