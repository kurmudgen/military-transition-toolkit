# 2G0X1 Logistics Plans → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 2G0X1 experience in logistics planning, deployment operations, and readiness management provides strategic logistics skills valued across industries.

## What You Actually Do as a Logistics Plans Specialist
You're the Air Force's logistics strategist. While others execute logistics, you plan it. You've developed deployment plans, coordinated logistics for exercises, and ensured units were ready to deploy. You understand how logistics enables operations and how to anticipate requirements.

Your work involves deployment planning, readiness reporting, exercise coordination, and contingency planning. You've worked with UTCs, developed logistics annexes, and coordinated across multiple agencies. You understand how to move people and equipment to accomplish missions.

Beyond planning, you've developed coordination and communication skills. Logistics plans involve multiple stakeholders—operations, maintenance, supply, transportation. You've brought these elements together into coherent plans. This integration skill transfers to civilian supply chain planning.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Getting APICS Certified:** Your military planning experience is valuable but APICS certifications prove you understand civilian supply chain planning. CSCP or CPIM is essential.

**Underselling Strategic Perspective:** Your experience planning deployments and operations is strategic. Position yourself above tactical logistics—you're a planner, not a warehouse manager.

**Ignoring Defense Contractors:** Defense contractors need personnel who understand military logistics planning. Your experience is directly relevant for supporting military customers.

**Limiting to "Logistics" Searches:** Supply chain planning, demand planning, and operations planning are related fields. Expand your job search beyond "logistics" titles.

**Not Demonstrating Analytical Skills:** Modern logistics planning is data-driven. Highlight any analytical work—forecasting, optimization, modeling.
