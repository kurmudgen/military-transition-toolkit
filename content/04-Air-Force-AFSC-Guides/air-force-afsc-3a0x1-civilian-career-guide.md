**Not Getting Microsoft Certified:** Microsoft 365 dominates the collaboration market. Get certified in SharePoint and Teams—it's expected.

**Ignoring Power Platform:** Power Apps and Power Automate are increasingly important. Basic automation skills differentiate candidates.

**Only Targeting "Knowledge Management" Searches:** Search for SharePoint administrator, collaboration specialist, content manager, and information architect. The field uses many titles.

**Undervaluing Platform Experience:** Your hands-on SharePoint and collaboration platform experience is valuable. Emphasize technical capabilities alongside strategic KM skills.

**Not Building a Portfolio:** Document KM solutions you've implemented. Screenshots and descriptions of collaboration sites demonstrate capability.
