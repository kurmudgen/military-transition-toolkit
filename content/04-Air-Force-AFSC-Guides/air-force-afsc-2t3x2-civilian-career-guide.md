# 2T3X2 Vehicle Maintenance Management → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 2T3X2 experience in vehicle maintenance management—supervising technicians, managing work orders, and overseeing fleet maintenance operations—provides strong foundation for fleet management careers. Top paths include **Fleet Maintenance Manager** ($55,000-$90,000), **Service Manager** ($50,000-$85,000), and **Maintenance Superintendent** ($60,000-$95,000). Your leadership and maintenance management experience distinguishes you from mechanics seeking management roles. Timeline: 30-60 days; management roles take longer to fill but pay more.

## What You Actually Do as a Vehicle Maintenance Manager
You're the Air Force's fleet maintenance leader. You don't just turn wrenches—you manage the shop. You supervise technicians, schedule maintenance, manage work orders, and ensure vehicles are ready when the mission needs them. You balance resources, training, and priorities.

Your work involves workforce management, maintenance scheduling, quality control, and resource allocation. You've tracked maintenance metrics, managed parts budgets, and ensured compliance with regulations. You understand how to keep a fleet operational with limited resources.

Beyond day-to-day management, you've developed leadership skills—mentoring technicians, handling personnel issues, and building effective teams. These skills transfer directly to civilian fleet management.
