## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Pursuing Licensure:** State licensure is essential for electrical careers. Research your state's requirements and how military experience applies.

**Ignoring Union Opportunities:** IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) offers excellent training, wages, and benefits. Union apprenticeship programs value military experience.

**Accepting Non-Licensed Positions:** Some employers hire "electrical helpers" who don't need licenses—this limits advancement. Pursue licensed positions.

**Not Documenting Hours:** Your military electrical hours may count toward licensure. Document everything—it could significantly shorten your apprenticeship requirements.

**Undervaluing Industrial Experience:** Industrial electricians often earn more than commercial. If you have industrial experience, target those higher-paying positions.
