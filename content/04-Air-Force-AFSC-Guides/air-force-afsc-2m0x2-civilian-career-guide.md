## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Ignoring Commercial Space:** SpaceX and others actively hire missile maintainers. Launch operations require the same precision and safety culture you've developed. Apply to commercial space companies.

**Not Leveraging Heavy Equipment Experience:** Transporter-erector and crane experience is valuable in construction and heavy industry. Don't overlook these opportunities if space work isn't available.

**Staying in Remote Locations:** ICBM bases are remote. For best opportunities, consider relocating to aerospace hubs where space companies operate.

**Not Maintaining Clearance:** For defense work, your clearance matters. Secure cleared employment before it lapses if pursuing ICBM contractor positions.

**Undervaluing Hydraulics Experience:** Hydraulic and pneumatic skills are specialized. Many technicians lack fluid power expertise—this differentiates you.
