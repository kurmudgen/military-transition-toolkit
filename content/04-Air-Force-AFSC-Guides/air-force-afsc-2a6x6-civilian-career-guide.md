# 2A6X6 Aircraft Electrical and Environmental Systems → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 2A6X6 expertise in aircraft electrical systems, environmental control, pressurization, and oxygen systems provides dual-specialty value. Top civilian paths include **Aircraft Electrician** ($55,000-$90,000), **Environmental Systems Technician** ($55,000-$85,000), and **A&P Mechanic** ($55,000-$95,000). Your combined electrical and environmental knowledge is valuable—these systems are interrelated and technicians who understand both are efficient troubleshooters. The A&P license opens commercial aviation doors. Timeline: 30-60 days with A&P; defense contractor positions available with clearance.

## What You Actually Do as an E&E Technician
You're the Air Force's dual-specialty technician—both aircraft electrician and environmental systems specialist. Electrical power generation, distribution, and control systems are your domain, along with air conditioning, pressurization, oxygen systems, and anti-ice systems. You keep electrons flowing and cabins comfortable.

Your daily work involves troubleshooting electrical faults, repairing wiring, testing generators and control systems, maintaining air conditioning packs, and servicing pressurization and oxygen systems. You've used multimeters, oscilloscopes, and environmental test equipment. You understand how electrical loads affect generators and how pack valves affect cabin temperature.

Beyond troubleshooting, you've developed skills in reading electrical schematics, interpreting wire diagrams, and understanding complex system interactions. These analytical skills transfer to any electrical or environmental role.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Aircraft Electrician - $55,000-$90,000
Airlines and MROs need electricians who can troubleshoot aircraft electrical systems. You'll trace wiring, repair connectors, test generators, and maintain electrical distribution systems. Senior aircraft electricians at major airlines earn $80,000-$90,000 plus benefits.

### 2. Environmental Systems Technician - $55,000-$85,000
Aircraft ECS (air conditioning, pressurization, oxygen) requires specialized knowledge. Airlines and MROs have dedicated environmental shops. Your experience with pack valves, pressurization controllers, and oxygen systems is directly applicable.

### 3. A&P Mechanic - $55,000-$95,000
With A&P license, your combined E&E expertise makes you versatile. You can work general maintenance while being the go-to person for electrical and environmental issues. Airlines value mechanics with system specialties.

### 4. Electrician (Industrial/Commercial) - $50,000-$85,000
Your electrical skills transfer beyond aviation. Industrial electricians maintain manufacturing equipment, commercial electricians wire buildings. With additional licensing, you can work as a journeyman electrician.

### 5. HVAC Technician - $45,000-$75,000
Your environmental systems knowledge applies to commercial HVAC. Refrigeration cycles, heat exchangers, and control systems are similar concepts. This path offers geographic flexibility and steady demand.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Leveraging Dual Expertise:** You have both electrical AND environmental skills. This combination is valuable—don't downplay either. Highlight that you troubleshoot across both systems.

**Ignoring Environmental Specialty:** Environmental systems (ECS) is specialized. Airlines have dedicated environmental shops. Your pack valve and pressurization experience is valuable for these positions.

**Waiting on A&P:** Use the military competency pathway. Your E&E experience provides significant credit toward requirements. Don't separate without starting this process.

**Not Getting EPA 608:** You need civilian refrigerant certification even though you've worked on aircraft AC systems. Get certified before job searching.

**Overlooking Industrial Electrical:** If aviation doesn't appeal, your electrical skills work in any industry. Industrial electrician positions pay well and are available everywhere.
