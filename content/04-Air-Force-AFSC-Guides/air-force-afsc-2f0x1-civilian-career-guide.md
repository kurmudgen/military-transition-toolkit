# 2F0X1 Fuels → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 2F0X1 experience in petroleum operations—fuel receipt, storage, distribution, and quality control—provides specialized skills for the energy industry. Top paths include **Fuel Distribution Technician** ($45,000-$75,000), **Petroleum Terminal Operator** ($50,000-$80,000), and **Aviation Fuels Specialist** ($50,000-$85,000). The petroleum industry runs on specialized personnel who understand fuel handling, quality control, and safety. Your experience is directly applicable. Timeline: 2-4 weeks; fuel operations positions are steady.

## What You Actually Do as a POL Specialist
You're the Air Force's fuel expert. You receive, store, issue, and quality-test petroleum products—primarily JP-8 aviation fuel. You operate fuel storage facilities, service aircraft, maintain fuel systems, and ensure fuel quality from receipt to consumption.

Your daily work involves fuel receipt operations, aircraft refueling, quality surveillance testing, and fuel system maintenance. You've operated fuel trucks, maintained hydrant systems, tested for contamination, and managed fuel accountability. You understand specific gravity, flashpoint, and the properties that make fuel safe and effective.

Beyond operations, you've developed safety consciousness essential in petroleum work. One spark in the wrong place can be catastrophic. This safety mindset transfers directly to civilian petroleum operations.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Fuel Distribution Technician - $45,000-$75,000
Petroleum distribution companies need technicians to receive, store, and deliver fuel products. You'll work at terminals, tank farms, or delivery operations. Your receipt and distribution experience applies directly.

### 2. Petroleum Terminal Operator - $50,000-$80,000
Oil terminals need operators to manage fuel receipt, storage, and dispatch. You'll monitor tank levels, coordinate tanker transfers, and ensure product quality. Your facility operations experience is directly relevant.

### 3. Aviation Fuels Specialist - $50,000-$85,000
Airports and FBOs (Fixed Base Operators) need specialists to fuel aircraft. Your aircraft refueling experience and quality control knowledge apply directly. Aviation fuel positions often pay premium wages.

### 4. Fuel Quality Technician - $50,000-$75,000
Refineries and distribution companies need technicians to test fuel quality. Your lab testing and quality surveillance experience qualifies you for these positions.

### 5. Pipeline Operator - $55,000-$90,000
Pipeline companies need operators to monitor product flow, manage pump stations, and ensure delivery integrity. Your understanding of fuel movement and storage applies to pipeline operations.

**Not Getting CDL for Delivery:** Fuel delivery drivers earn good wages. CDL with tanker endorsement opens this path.

**Undervaluing Aviation Fuel Experience:** FBOs and airport fuel operations pay well for experienced aircraft refuelers. Target aviation fuel specifically.

**Not Pursuing Pipeline Opportunities:** Pipeline operators pay well and your fuel movement experience is relevant. These are often non-urban locations with lower cost of living.

**Forgetting Safety Emphasis:** Safety is paramount in petroleum. Highlight your safety record and training in every interview.
