# 1C7X1 Airfield Management → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 1C7X1 experience managing airfield operations, flight planning, and aviation services translates directly to civilian aviation operations. Top civilian paths include **Airport Operations Manager** ($55,000-$100,000), **Flight Operations Specialist** ($45,000-$75,000), and **FBO Manager** ($50,000-$85,000). Your understanding of airfield operations, NOTAMs, and flight coordination is directly applicable. Airports and aviation companies need people who understand how airfields actually work. Timeline: 30-60 days.

## What You Actually Do as an Airfield Management Specialist
You're the airfield's operations coordinator. Your job ensures everything on the airfield runs smoothly—from NOTAM management to flight following, from base operations to airfield inspections. You've managed the controlled movement area, coordinated with ATC, and ensured pilots have the information they need.

Your daily work involves processing flight plans, issuing PPR (prior permission required) numbers, conducting airfield inspections, managing NOTAMs, and coordinating airfield activities. You've been the go-to person for transient aircrews, managed airfield emergencies, and ensured compliance with flight operations directives.

Beyond the technical work, you've developed customer service skills dealing with pilots, communication skills coordinating complex operations, and attention to detail ensuring nothing falls through the cracks on a busy airfield.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Airport Operations Manager - $55,000-$100,000
Commercial airports need operations managers who understand airside operations. You'll oversee ground operations, ensure FAA compliance, coordinate emergencies, and manage airfield activities. Your military airfield experience provides excellent foundation.

### 2. FBO Manager/Operations - $50,000-$85,000
Fixed Base Operators provide services to general aviation and corporate aircraft. FBO managers oversee fueling, ground services, and customer relations. Your base operations experience translates directly to this customer-facing aviation role.

### 3. Flight Operations Specialist - $45,000-$75,000

**Not Considering FBO Path:** FBOs offer excellent opportunities for customer-oriented aviation professionals. Your experience coordinating transient aircraft is directly relevant.

**Ignoring Airport Authority Jobs:** Airport authorities hire operations specialists, safety officers, and managers. Search airport authority websites directly—not all jobs appear on major job boards.

**Not Pursuing AAAE Certifications:** Airport industry certifications demonstrate commitment to the profession and knowledge of civilian airport operations.

**Limiting Search to Large Airports:** Smaller regional airports often hire faster and provide excellent learning opportunities. Consider starting at a regional airport for faster career progression.
