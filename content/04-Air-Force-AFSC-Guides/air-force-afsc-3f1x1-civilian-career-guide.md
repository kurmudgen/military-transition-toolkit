## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Starting at Entry Level:** Your military experience qualifies you for supervisory and management positions. Don't accept line cook or front desk agent roles unless stepping stone.

**Not Getting ServSafe:** ServSafe Manager certification is expected in food service. Get it—it's easy with your background and demonstrates commitment.

**Ignoring Contract Food Service:** Compass, Aramark, and Sodexo run dining operations at corporations, hospitals, and institutions. These are stable positions with career paths.

**Undervaluing Military Scale:** You've managed operations serving hundreds or thousands. Emphasize the scale of your experience—it's often larger than civilian equivalents.

**Not Considering Non-Traditional Hospitality:** Corporate dining, university food service, and hospital food service offer better hours and benefits than restaurants.
