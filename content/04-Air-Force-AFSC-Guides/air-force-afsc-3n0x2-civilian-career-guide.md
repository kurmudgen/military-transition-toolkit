# 3N0X2 Radio and Television Broadcasting → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 3N0X2 experience in broadcast production, technical operations, and audio/video engineering provides strong foundation for production and engineering careers. Top paths include **Broadcast Engineer** ($50,000-$85,000), **Audio/Video Production Technician** ($45,000-$75,000), and **Production Manager** ($55,000-$90,000). While on-air talent gets attention, the technical production roles you've mastered are consistently in demand. Every broadcast, stream, and production needs skilled technicians. Timeline: 30-45 days; technical roles fill quickly.

## What You Actually Do as a Radio/TV Broadcasting Specialist
You're the Air Force's broadcast engineer and production technician. You operate the technical equipment that makes broadcasts happen—cameras, audio boards, switching equipment, transmitters. While others are on camera, you ensure everything works.

Your daily work involves camera operation, audio mixing, video switching, and technical maintenance. You've operated broadcast control rooms, managed live productions, and maintained broadcast equipment. You understand the full technical infrastructure of broadcasting.

Beyond operations, you've developed troubleshooting skills and the ability to work under pressure. Live broadcasts don't wait for problems to be solved—you've learned to fix issues in real-time. These skills transfer directly to civilian production and broadcast engineering.
