# 4N0X1 Aerospace Medical Service → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 4N0X1 experience as an Air Force medical technician—performing clinical care, drawing blood, administering medications, and supporting physicians—provides foundation for multiple healthcare careers. Top paths include **EMT/Paramedic** ($35,000-$60,000), **Medical Assistant** ($35,000-$45,000), and **Nursing** ($55,000-$90,000 with RN degree). Your hands-on patient care experience is valuable, but credential transfer varies by state. Timeline: 2-4 weeks for MA positions; longer for licensed roles requiring education.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Settling for Low-Paying Entry Positions:** Your skills have value. Pursue certifications that maximize earning potential—paramedic vs. EMT, CMA vs. uncertified.

**Not Using Education Benefits for Nursing:** RN salaries far exceed technician roles. If nursing interests you, use GI Bill—the investment pays off quickly.

**Ignoring State-Specific Requirements:** Each state has different requirements for military medics. Research thoroughly before assuming your training transfers.

**Not Documenting Military Training:** Obtain detailed documentation of your military medical training. Specific procedures and hours may qualify for credit.
