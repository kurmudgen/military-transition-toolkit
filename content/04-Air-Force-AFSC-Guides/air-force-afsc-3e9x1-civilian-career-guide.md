# 3E9X1 Emergency Management → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 3E9X1 experience in emergency planning, CBRN defense, and disaster response provides excellent foundation for emergency management careers. Top paths include **Emergency Manager** ($55,000-$95,000), **Business Continuity Planner** ($65,000-$100,000), and **Homeland Security Specialist** ($60,000-$95,000).

## What You Actually Do as an Emergency Management Specialist
You're the Air Force's disaster preparedness expert. You develop emergency plans, conduct exercises, train personnel, and coordinate response to real-world emergencies. From natural disasters to CBRN threats, you ensure installations are prepared.

Your daily work involves emergency planning, exercise development, training delivery, and response coordination. You've written comprehensive emergency plans, conducted full-scale exercises, and responded to actual emergencies. You understand the entire emergency management cycle—mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.

Beyond planning, you've developed expertise in CBRN defense, including detection, protection, and decontamination. This specialized knowledge has civilian applications in hazmat response and industrial safety.

**Only Targeting Government Positions:** Corporate business continuity often pays more than government emergency management. Explore private sector opportunities.

**Undervaluing CBRN Experience:** Your hazmat and CBRN expertise is specialized. Industrial hazmat, hospital biopreparedness, and security consulting value this background.

**Ignoring Business Continuity Path:** Business continuity planning is closely related to emergency management but often pays better. Consider CBCP certification.

**Not Completing FEMA Courses:** FEMA's free Independent Study courses are expected credentials. Complete IS-100, IS-200, IS-700, IS-800 if not already held.
