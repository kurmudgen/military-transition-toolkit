# 3D0X2 Cyber Systems Operations → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 3D0X2 training in server administration and network operations puts you in excellent position for civilian IT careers. Top paths include **Systems Administrator** ($65,000-$110,000), **Cloud Engineer** ($90,000-$150,000), and **DevOps Engineer** ($95,000-$160,000). With your experience managing Windows and Linux servers in mission-critical environments, you can land a solid IT operations role within 45-60 days. Cloud skills are the force multiplier—add AWS or Azure certifications and you'll command top-tier salaries.

## What You Actually Do as a Cyber Systems Operations Specialist
You're the backbone of Air Force IT infrastructure. Your days revolve around keeping servers running, managing Active Directory, and ensuring networks stay operational. You've installed, configured, and maintained Windows and Linux servers supporting thousands of users. When systems go down at 0200, you're the one getting the call.

You've worked with enterprise technologies including VMware virtualization, Microsoft Exchange, and various backup solutions. You've managed user accounts, group policies, and security configurations. You've probably deployed servers both in traditional data centers and increasingly in cloud environments.

The pressure you've worked under is a major selling point. Mission-critical systems mean zero tolerance for extended downtime. You've developed troubleshooting skills under pressure, documented procedures meticulously, and learned to communicate technical issues to non-technical leadership. These skills translate directly to civilian IT operations centers and data center environments.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Systems Administrator - $65,000-$110,000
This is your most direct path. You'll manage Windows and Linux servers, handle user administration, maintain backups, and troubleshoot issues—exactly what you've been doing. Mid-level sysadmin roles start around $80,000, and senior positions push past $100,000. The role is stable, in-demand, and exists in virtually every company with more than 50 employees.

### 2. Cloud Engineer / Cloud Administrator - $90,000-$150,000
This is where the money is going. Companies are migrating to AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, and they need people who understand server operations to manage these environments. Your traditional server skills translate well—the concepts are the same, just in a different delivery model. Cloud Engineers with strong credentials regularly command $130,000+.

### 3. DevOps Engineer - $95,000-$160,000
DevOps combines system administration with automation and development practices. If you've worked with scripting (PowerShell, Bash, Python) and have an interest in automation, this path offers excellent compensation. DevOps Engineers build CI/CD pipelines, manage infrastructure as code, and bridge the gap between development and operations teams.

### 4. Network Administrator - $60,000-$95,000
While your primary focus was servers, you've inevitably gained network experience. Network Admins manage routers, switches, firewalls, and ensure connectivity across the enterprise. This path is slightly different from pure systems work but leverages your infrastructure background. CCNA certification accelerates this path significantly.

### 5. IT Support Manager / Team Lead - $70,000-$110,000
Your military leadership experience combined with technical skills positions you for management roles. IT Support Managers oversee help desk teams and ensure service level agreements are met. If you enjoyed the leadership aspects of your military role, this path lets you manage people while staying connected to technology.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Staying in Your Comfort Zone:** Don't just target the same Windows server admin role you had in the Air Force. The cloud is where IT is going—invest time in learning AWS or Azure even if it's new territory.

**Ignoring Automation Skills:** Companies expect modern sysadmins to automate repetitive tasks. If you're weak on PowerShell, Python, or Ansible, spend your transition time improving these skills. Manual-only administrators are being left behind.

**Underestimating Your Experience:** You've managed mission-critical systems where downtime wasn't an option. Many civilian IT shops are less demanding. Don't undersell what you've accomplished—frame your experience confidently.

**Neglecting Soft Skills in Interviews:** You can talk servers all day, but civilian employers also want to hear about teamwork, communication, and handling difficult situations. Prepare stories that showcase both technical and interpersonal skills.

**Not Leveraging Your Clearance:** If you have a Secret or TS clearance, it's worth $10,000-$20,000 in additional salary with contractors. Don't let it lapse. Apply to cleared positions before separating.
