# 1N1X1 Geospatial Intelligence → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 1N1X1 expertise in geospatial intelligence and imagery analysis opens doors to both cleared and commercial opportunities. Top civilian paths include **Imagery Analyst** ($70,000-$120,000), **GIS Analyst** ($55,000-$90,000), and **Remote Sensing Specialist** ($65,000-$110,000). The commercial satellite industry is exploding, and companies need people who can interpret imagery. Your clearance gets you premium contractor roles immediately, while your technical skills transfer to growing civilian geospatial markets. Timeline to employment: 15-30 days.

## What You Actually Do as a Geospatial Intelligence Analyst
You're the Air Force's imagery expert. Your eyes have studied satellite and aerial imagery to extract intelligence—identifying military equipment, tracking patterns of life, assessing bomb damage, and supporting targeting. You've transformed pixels into actionable intelligence.

Your daily work involves analyzing multi-spectral imagery, creating geospatial products, and writing imagery intelligence reports. You've worked with systems like RemoteView, SOCET GXP, and various NGA platforms. You understand photogrammetry, mensuration, and the characteristics that distinguish friend from foe in imagery.

Beyond imagery interpretation, you've developed geospatial thinking—understanding how location and terrain affect military operations. You've created maps, overlays, and geospatial products that commanders used for mission planning. This combination of analytical skill and geographic knowledge is increasingly valuable as location data becomes central to business and government decisions.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Imagery Analyst (Defense/Intel Contractor) - $70,000-$120,000
This is your direct transition. Defense contractors need cleared imagery analysts to support NGA, combat commands, and intelligence agencies. You'll continue the same work—analyzing satellite imagery, producing intelligence products, and supporting military customers. Senior imagery analysts with specialized expertise earn $130,000+.

### 2. GIS Analyst - $55,000-$90,000
Geographic Information Systems analysts work with spatial data across industries—urban planning, environmental consulting, utilities, oil and gas. Your understanding of geospatial data, coordinate systems, and mapping translates directly. GIS work is less about intelligence and more about location-based data analysis for business.

### 3. Remote Sensing Specialist - $65,000-$110,000
Commercial satellite companies are launching more satellites than ever. They need analysts who understand remote sensing, spectral analysis, and imagery interpretation. Companies like Planet, Maxar, and BlackSky hire former military imagery analysts for commercial applications.

### 4. Cartographer / Geospatial Product Developer - $60,000-$95,000
Your experience creating maps and geospatial products applies to cartography and product development roles. You'll create maps, charts, and visual products for various customers. This role exists in government, contractors, and commercial mapping companies.

### 5. Geospatial Intelligence Consultant - $85,000-$140,000
Consulting firms help organizations understand and utilize geospatial data. Your expertise in GEOINT processes, tools, and applications positions you for advisory roles. This path combines technical knowledge with client-facing work.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Learning Commercial GIS Tools:** Military systems like SOCET GXP don't exist in the commercial world. Learn Esri ArcGIS—it's the industry standard. Online tutorials and Esri certifications are available.

**Ignoring Commercial Satellite Industry:** The commercial satellite market is growing explosively. Companies like Planet, BlackSky, and Maxar offer opportunities outside traditional defense work. Don't limit yourself to NGA contractor roles.

**Underselling Your Visual Analysis Skills:** You've trained your eyes to detect subtle patterns. This visual analytical skill is rare. Don't undersell the years of experience interpreting complex imagery.

**Not Understanding GIS vs. GEOINT:** Commercial GIS focuses on spatial data analysis for business—not intelligence. If targeting GIS roles, learn to speak that language (spatial analysis, geodatabase, cartography) rather than intel terminology.

**Letting Technical Skills Rust:** If you're in a supervisory role away from exploitation, refresh your hands-on skills before transitioning. Employers want analysts who can still do the work.
