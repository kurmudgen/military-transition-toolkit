## What You Actually Do as a Personnel Specialist
You're the Air Force's HR professional. You manage personnel records, process administrative actions, counsel members on benefits, and keep the personnel system running. You've touched every aspect of a service member's administrative career—from enlistment to retirement.

Your daily work involves processing personnel actions, maintaining records, counseling on benefits and entitlements, and working with HR information systems. You've processed promotions, reassignments, separations, and retirements. You understand how HR policies affect real people.

Beyond transactions, you've developed customer service skills helping members navigate complex personnel issues. This combination of technical HR knowledge and interpersonal skills transfers directly to civilian HR.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Getting SHRM Certified:** Military HR experience is valuable, but SHRM certification proves you know civilian HR. Get SHRM-CP before or shortly after separating.

**Undervaluing Customer Service Experience:** HR is a service function. Your experience helping members with personnel issues is valuable—emphasize it.

**Not Learning Civilian HR Systems:** Military systems don't transfer. Familiarize yourself with Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, or other common HRIS platforms.

**Accepting Admin-Only Roles:** Your experience qualifies you for HR specialist positions, not just administrative assistant roles. Target accordingly.

**Ignoring Specialized Paths:** Benefits, recruiting, and HRIS are specialized HR fields that often pay more than generalist roles. Consider specialization.
