# 3D0X1 Knowledge Operations Management → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 3D0X1 experience translates directly into high-demand IT and information management roles. Top civilian paths include **IT Project Manager** ($80,000-$140,000), **Records/Information Manager** ($65,000-$110,000), and **Business Systems Analyst** ($70,000-$120,000). With your experience managing SharePoint, content management systems, and information workflows, you can land a solid position within 30-60 days. The IT management sector continues to grow, and your combination of technical skills and organizational experience is highly marketable.

## What You Actually Do as a Knowledge Operations Manager
You're the Air Force's information architect. Your job is making sure the right people have access to the right information at the right time. You've managed SharePoint sites, maintained official records, and ensured units comply with Air Force records management policies. You've created workflows, trained users on collaboration tools, and solved the headache of version control and document management.

On a daily basis, you've worked with Microsoft 365 suite, SharePoint administration, and various content management systems. You've dealt with classification guidelines, FOIA requests, and the challenge of organizing thousands of documents across multiple networks. You've probably been the go-to person for "how do I find that file" questions across your entire squadron.

Beyond the technical work, you've developed strong communication skills explaining complex systems to non-technical users. You've managed projects, coordinated with multiple stakeholders, and created training materials. These soft skills are exactly what civilian employers need for IT management and business analyst roles.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. IT Project Manager - $80,000-$140,000
Your experience coordinating technology implementations and managing information systems projects translates directly. You've already done project management—you just called it "squadron taskers" or "system migrations." With a PMP certification, you can command six figures in most markets. IT Project Managers are in constant demand as companies run more digital initiatives.

### 2. SharePoint Administrator / Microsoft 365 Admin - $75,000-$120,000
This is your most direct skills translation. You've been administering SharePoint and M365 environments throughout your career. Companies desperately need people who can manage their collaboration platforms, create workflows, and keep their digital workspace organized. Add a Microsoft certification and you're immediately competitive.

### 3. Records and Information Manager - $65,000-$110,000
Every company has compliance requirements for records retention. Your experience with Air Force records management, including AFRIMS and the National Archives requirements, gives you a foundation in information governance. Healthcare, finance, and government contractors pay premium salaries for experienced records managers.

### 4. Business Systems Analyst - $70,000-$120,000
You've spent years analyzing how information flows through organizations and finding ways to improve it. Business Systems Analysts do exactly that—they bridge the gap between business needs and technology solutions. Your ability to document requirements, create workflows, and train users is exactly what this role demands.

### 5. Technical Writer / Documentation Specialist - $60,000-$95,000
All those SOPs, training guides, and process documents you created? That's technical writing. Companies need people who can translate complex technical processes into clear documentation. This role offers excellent work-life balance and can be done remotely. Government contractors especially value your experience with classified documentation procedures.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Undervaluing Your Experience:** You've been managing enterprise systems for a large organization. Don't accept entry-level positions when you have years of hands-on experience. Target mid-level roles from the start.

**Not Getting Microsoft Certified:** You know SharePoint and M365 inside and out, but civilian employers want to see certifications. Spend a few weeks getting official Microsoft certs—they pay for themselves quickly.

**Ignoring the Records Management Niche:** Many 3D0X1s overlook records management as a career path. It's actually a well-paying specialty, especially in healthcare and finance where compliance is critical.

**Failing to Document Projects:** Before you separate, document every significant project you worked on—system migrations, workflow implementations, training programs. You'll need these for interviews and resume building.

**Only Targeting Government Contractors:** Private sector companies need SharePoint admins and IT project managers too. Don't limit yourself to the familiar contractor world—corporate jobs often have better benefits and work-life balance.
