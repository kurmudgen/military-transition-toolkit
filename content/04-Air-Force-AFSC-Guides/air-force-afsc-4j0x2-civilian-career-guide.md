# 4J0X2 Physical Medicine → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 4J0X2 experience in physical therapy, occupational therapy support, and rehabilitation services provides excellent foundation for rehabilitation aide and therapy assistant careers. Top paths include **Physical Therapy Aide** ($30,000-$40,000), **Physical Therapist Assistant** ($50,000-$65,000 with degree), and **Rehabilitation Technician** ($35,000-$50,000). With additional education, you can become a licensed PTA or OTA. Your hands-on patient care experience is valuable—education pathway determines advancement. Timeline: 2-4 weeks for aide positions; 2 years for PTA/OTA programs.

## What You Actually Do as a Physical Medicine Technician
You're the Air Force's rehabilitation support specialist. You assist physical therapists and occupational therapists in treating patients with injuries, illnesses, or disabilities. You help patients regain function through therapeutic exercises and modalities.

Your daily work involves patient treatment under supervision, exercise instruction, modality application, and documentation. You've assisted with therapeutic exercises, applied hot/cold packs, set up equipment, and helped patients with mobility. You understand rehabilitation principles and patient progression.

Beyond treatment support, you've developed patient care skills—motivation, communication, and adapting to patient needs. You can work with diverse patient populations and understand the rehabilitation process. These skills transfer to civilian rehabilitation settings.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) - $50,000-$65,000
With a 2-year PTA degree, you can deliver physical therapy treatments under PT supervision. Your military experience provides excellent preparation for PTA education. Licensed PTAs are in high demand.

### 2. Occupational Therapy Assistant (OTA) - $50,000-$65,000
Similar to PTA, OTA requires a 2-year degree. Your experience with functional activities and rehabilitation applies. OTAs work with patients on daily living skills.

### 3. Physical Therapy Aide - $30,000-$40,000
PT aides support therapy operations without licensure. This is a direct transition from your military role while pursuing education. Aides prepare patients and maintain equipment.

### 4. Rehabilitation Technician - $35,000-$50,000
Rehab techs work in hospitals and rehab facilities supporting therapy services. Your experience applies directly. Good position while pursuing PTA education.

### 5. Athletic Trainer (with degree) - $48,000-$65,000
If you pursue athletic training education, your rehabilitation background provides foundation. Athletic trainers work with athletes on prevention and rehabilitation.

**Ignoring VA Education Benefits:** GI Bill can fund PTA/OTA education. Use your benefits—the investment pays off quickly.

**Undervaluing Patient Care Experience:** Your hands-on experience with rehabilitation patients is valuable. Emphasize the diversity of conditions and patients treated.

**Not Considering Related Fields:** Personal training, strength and conditioning, and wellness coaching use similar skills if traditional PT path isn't desired.
