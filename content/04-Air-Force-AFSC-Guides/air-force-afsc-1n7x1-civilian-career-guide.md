# 1N7X1 Human Intelligence Specialist → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 1N7X1 experience in human intelligence—source operations, debriefing, and intelligence collection—provides unique skills valued in both government and private sectors. Top civilian paths include **HUMINT Operations Officer/Support** ($75,000-$130,000), **Corporate Security Investigator** ($65,000-$110,000), and **Due Diligence Analyst** ($70,000-$120,000). Your interpersonal skills, investigative mindset, and clearance create opportunities in intelligence, investigations, and security consulting. Timeline to employment: 20-45 days with active clearance.

## What You Actually Do as a Human Intelligence Specialist
You're the Air Force's human collector. Your job involves eliciting information through personal interaction—debriefing sources, screening individuals, and conducting tactical questioning. You've developed the interpersonal skills to build rapport, assess credibility, and extract valuable intelligence from human contacts.

Your daily work varies widely depending on assignment—from conducting debriefings of foreign nationals to supporting tactical operations with human-derived intelligence. You've learned to read people, identify deception indicators, and ask the right questions. You understand source protection, report writing, and intelligence tradecraft.

Beyond collection skills, you've developed judgment and maturity handling sensitive operations. You've made real-time decisions about source reliability, protection considerations, and reporting requirements. These soft skills—interpersonal ability, judgment, and discretion—transfer to investigative and security roles across industries.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. HUMINT Operations Support (Contractor) - $75,000-$130,000
Defense contractors support IC HUMINT programs with targeting, analysis, and operational support. You won't be running sources as a contractor, but you can support operations, conduct analysis, or provide training. Your operational experience is valuable for realistic program support.

### 2. Corporate Security Investigator - $65,000-$110,000
Companies need investigators to conduct background investigations, internal investigations, and due diligence. Your interviewing skills, source assessment abilities, and investigative mindset apply directly. Financial institutions, tech companies, and large corporations have internal investigation teams.

### 3. Due Diligence / Intelligence Analyst (Private Sector) - $70,000-$120,000
Corporate intelligence firms conduct due diligence investigations—researching companies, individuals, and transactions for clients. Your ability to assess credibility, gather information, and produce intelligence reports translates well. Firms like Kroll, Control Risks, and Stroz Friedberg hire former HUMINT professionals.

### 4. Background Investigator - $50,000-$85,000
Federal contractors conduct background investigations for security clearances. Your interviewing skills and understanding of the clearance process are directly relevant. While pay starts lower, experienced investigators can earn well, and the work offers flexibility.

### 5. Executive Protection / Security Consulting - $70,000-$130,000
Your threat assessment skills and understanding of adversary TTPs apply to executive protection and security consulting. You'll assess threats to executives, plan protective operations, or advise organizations on security posture. This path values your operational judgment.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Expecting to Continue Source Operations:** As a contractor, you won't run sources—that's for government employees. Adjust expectations toward support, analysis, or adjacent fields like investigations.

**Not Recognizing Transferable Skills:** Your ability to build rapport, conduct interviews, and assess credibility applies far beyond intelligence. Corporate investigations, HR, compliance, and consulting all value these skills.

**Underselling Interpersonal Abilities:** Technical AFSCs can point to systems and certifications. Your value is harder to quantify but equally real. Practice articulating how your interpersonal and analytical skills solved real problems.

**Ignoring Corporate Intelligence Field:** Companies like Kroll and Control Risks do fascinating work—investigating fraud, conducting due diligence, assessing risks. This field values former HUMINT professionals and often pays well.

**Not Obtaining Investigative Credentials:** CFE and PCI certifications demonstrate investigative competence to civilian employers who may not understand military HUMINT training.
