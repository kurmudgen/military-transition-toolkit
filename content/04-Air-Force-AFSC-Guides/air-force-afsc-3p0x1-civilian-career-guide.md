## What You Actually Do as Security Forces
You're the Air Force's law enforcement and security professional. You protect bases, enforce laws, respond to emergencies, and provide force protection. You've patrolled, investigated incidents, controlled access, and responded to security threats.

**Ignoring Corporate Security:** Corporate security often pays better than police with better hours. Your management experience supports this path.

**Not Getting CPP Certified:** For corporate security, CPP certification is the gold standard. It validates your security management expertise.

**Undervaluing Security Clearance:** Your clearance has value for federal positions and cleared contractors. Maintain it if possible.
