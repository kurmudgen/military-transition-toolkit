**Only Targeting Federal EEO Positions:** Corporate DEI roles often pay more and offer growth. Explore private sector opportunities.

**Undervaluing Investigation Experience:** Your investigative skills are valuable for employee relations, not just DEI. Consider compliance and investigation roles.

**Ignoring Data Analytics:** DEI increasingly relies on workforce analytics. Develop skills in analyzing demographic and climate data.

**Not Building a DEI Portfolio:** Document programs you've developed, training delivered, and outcomes achieved. Quantify your impact.
