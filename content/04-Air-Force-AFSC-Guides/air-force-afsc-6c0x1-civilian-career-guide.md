# 6C0X1 Contracting → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 6C0X1 experience in government contracting—source selection, contract administration, and procurement—provides highly marketable skills. Top paths include **Contract Specialist (Government)** ($60,000-$120,000), **Procurement Manager** ($65,000-$110,000), and **Contracts Manager (Defense Contractor)** ($75,000-$130,000). Government contracting is a specialized field with high demand. Your FAR knowledge and contracting experience are directly applicable. DAWIA and/or civilian certifications accelerate placement. Timeline: 30-60 days for government; defense contractors always hiring.

## What You Actually Do as a Contracting Specialist
You're the Air Force's business expert. You execute contracts that acquire everything from aircraft to office supplies. You know the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), understand source selection, and have negotiated with vendors. You turn requirements into legally binding agreements.

Your work involves market research, solicitation development, proposal evaluation, contract award, and administration. You've written statements of work, evaluated past performance, negotiated prices, and managed contracts through completion. You understand the contracting lifecycle from requirement to closeout.

Beyond transactional work, you've developed analytical and negotiation skills. You've balanced mission needs with regulatory compliance, found creative solutions to acquisition challenges, and managed relationships with contractors. These skills transfer directly to civilian procurement.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Contract Specialist (Federal Government) - $60,000-$120,000
Federal agencies need contract specialists across every department. Your DAWIA certification and FAR knowledge apply directly. GS-11 to GS-14 positions are common for experienced veterans. Defense agencies particularly value your experience.

### 2. Contracts Manager (Defense Contractor) - $75,000-$130,000
Defense contractors need personnel to manage government contracts from the contractor side. Your understanding of government processes is invaluable. Companies actively recruit former government contracting officers.

### 3. Procurement Manager (Corporate) - $65,000-$110,000
Corporations need procurement professionals to manage supplier relationships and purchasing operations. Your negotiation and supplier management skills transfer, though commercial procurement differs from government.

### 4. Supply Chain/Sourcing Manager - $70,000-$115,000
Strategic sourcing combines procurement with supply chain optimization. Your source selection experience provides foundation. This path leads to senior supply chain leadership.

### 5. Consultant (Government Contracts) - $80,000-$150,000
Consulting firms advise companies on government contracting. Your insider knowledge of government processes is valuable. Major consulting firms and boutique government contracts consultancies hire experienced professionals.
