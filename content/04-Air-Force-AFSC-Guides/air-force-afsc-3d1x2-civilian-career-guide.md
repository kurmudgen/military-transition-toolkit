# 3D1X2 Cyber Transport Systems → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 3D1X2 networking experience is highly marketable in the civilian world. Top paths include **Network Administrator** ($65,000-$100,000), **Network Engineer** ($80,000-$130,000), and **Cloud Network Engineer** ($100,000-$160,000). You've configured routers, switches, and firewalls on networks that can't afford downtime. That experience, combined with Cisco certification, puts you in strong demand. Timeline to employment: 30-45 days for qualified candidates with CCNA.

## What You Actually Do as a Cyber Transport Systems Technician
You're the backbone of Air Force communications. Your job is making sure data flows—configuring routers and switches, maintaining network infrastructure, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and ensuring circuits stay operational. When the network goes down, mission stops. That pressure has taught you to diagnose problems quickly and implement solutions under stress.

Your daily work involves Cisco IOS configuration, VLAN management, routing protocols, and network monitoring. You've run cable, configured firewalls, and maintained circuits connecting bases to the broader DoD network. You understand both the physical layer (cabling, patch panels) and logical layer (IP addressing, subnetting, routing) of networking.

You've also dealt with the security side—implementing ACLs, managing firewall rules, and ensuring network traffic meets security requirements. This combination of networking and security knowledge is valuable in an era where network and security teams increasingly converge.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Network Administrator - $65,000-$100,000
This is your direct translation. Network Admins maintain existing network infrastructure—monitoring performance, troubleshooting issues, and implementing changes. It's hands-on work similar to what you've done. Mid-level positions start around $75,000, with senior administrators earning $100,000+ in major markets.

### 2. Network Engineer - $80,000-$130,000
Network Engineers design and implement network solutions rather than just maintaining them. This role involves more planning and architecture work. With a few years of civilian experience and advanced Cisco certifications (CCNP), you can move into engineering roles paying $100,000+. Senior Network Engineers at major companies earn $140,000+.

### 3. Cloud Network Engineer - $100,000-$160,000
As companies move to AWS, Azure, and GCP, they need people who understand networking to architect cloud connectivity. Your traditional networking knowledge translates to virtual networks, VPCs, and hybrid connectivity. Add cloud certifications and you'll access the highest-paying network roles available.

### 4. Security Engineer (Network Security) - $90,000-$140,000
Your firewall and security experience positions you for network security roles. Security Engineers implement and manage firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation. The convergence of network and security means your skills span both domains.

### 5. Telecommunications Engineer - $75,000-$120,000
If your 3D1X2 experience included significant circuit management and telecommunications work, this path leverages that specialization. Telecom engineers work with carriers, manage WAN circuits, and ensure enterprise connectivity. This is especially relevant if you worked with DISN or managed long-haul circuits.

### AWS Certified Advanced Networking Specialty
- **Cost:** $300
- **Study time:** 2-3 months (requires networking experience)
- **Why it matters:** Cloud networking is where the field is going. This certification combined with traditional networking experience commands top salaries.

### Palo Alto Networks Certified Network Security Administrator (PCNSA)
- **Cost:** $160
- **Study time:** 4-6 weeks
- **Why it matters:** Palo Alto firewalls are industry-leading. Many enterprises use Palo Alto, and certified engineers are in high demand.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Having CCNA:** In the networking world, CCNA is expected. If you don't have it, you'll lose opportunities to candidates who do. Make this certification your top priority before separating.

**Ignoring Cloud Networking:** Traditional networking is evolving. Companies are moving to cloud and software-defined networking. If you only know traditional Cisco IOS, you're limiting your future. Learn AWS VPCs, Azure networking, and SD-WAN concepts.

**Undervaluing Your Troubleshooting Skills:** You've diagnosed network issues under real pressure. Civilian interviewers love hearing about specific problems you solved. Prepare stories about outages you resolved.

**Only Targeting Network-Only Roles:** Many infrastructure roles combine networking with systems administration or security. Don't limit yourself—broader infrastructure roles often pay more and offer more variety.

**Not Practicing for Technical Interviews:** Network engineering interviews often include technical questions about subnetting, routing protocols, and troubleshooting scenarios. Practice these before interviews.
