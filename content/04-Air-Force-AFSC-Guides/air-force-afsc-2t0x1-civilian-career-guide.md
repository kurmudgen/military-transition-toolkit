# 2T0X1 Traffic Management → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 2T0X1 experience in transportation coordination, cargo documentation, and freight management provides strong foundation for civilian logistics careers. Top paths include **Freight/Logistics Coordinator** ($45,000-$70,000), **Transportation Analyst** ($50,000-$75,000), and **Import/Export Specialist** ($50,000-$80,000).

## What You Actually Do as a Traffic Management Specialist
You're the Air Force's shipping expert. You coordinate the movement of cargo and passengers—arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and ensuring shipments reach their destinations. From commercial bill of ladings to hazmat placards, you handle the paperwork that makes logistics work.

Your daily work involves booking cargo with carriers, preparing shipping documents, coordinating with freight terminals, and tracking shipments. You've processed personal property shipments, unit deployments, and hazmat materials. You understand carrier selection, rate negotiation, and regulatory compliance.

Beyond transactional work, you've developed coordination skills—working with customers, carriers, and receiving activities to solve shipping problems. These skills transfer directly to civilian freight forwarding and logistics.

**Ignoring Freight Forwarding:** Freight forwarders do exactly what you've done—coordinate shipments and documentation. Target these companies directly.

**Not Maintaining Hazmat Certification:** Your military hazmat training is valuable but expires. Maintain current DOT/IATA certification—it's a differentiator.

**Overlooking Import/Export:** International trade requires documentation expertise you have. Customs brokers and import/export specialists are well-compensated.

**Limiting to Defense:** Commercial freight is massive. Don't limit your search to defense logistics when FedEx, UPS, and thousands of companies need your skills.

**Not Considering Freight Brokerage:** If you're entrepreneurial, freight brokerage offers unlimited earning potential. Your carrier knowledge and coordination skills are the foundation.
