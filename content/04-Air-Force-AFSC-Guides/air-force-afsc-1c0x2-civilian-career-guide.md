## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Not Translating ARMS Experience:** ARMS is Air Force-specific. Explain your work in terms of aviation records management, compliance, and coordination that civilian employers understand.

**Undervaluing Attention to Detail:** Aviation records must be perfect. Your meticulous approach to accuracy is a selling point. Emphasize error rates, audit results, and compliance achievements.

**Ignoring Crew Scheduling Path:** Crew scheduling is specialized and pays well. Your experience coordinating training schedules is foundation for this work.

**Not Learning FAA Regulations:** Military and FAA regulations differ. Familiarize yourself with FAR Part 117 (duty time), Part 121 (airline ops), and Part 91 (general aviation) to speak civilian aviation language.

**Overlooking Corporate Aviation:** Business aviation needs records managers and operations coordinators. Don't limit search to airlines—corporate flight departments offer good opportunities.
