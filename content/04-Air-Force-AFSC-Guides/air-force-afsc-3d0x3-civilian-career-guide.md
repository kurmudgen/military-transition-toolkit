# 3D0X3 Cyber Surety → Civilian Career Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
Your 3D0X3 experience in cybersecurity policy, risk management, and compliance is gold in the civilian market. Top paths include **Information Security Analyst** ($75,000-$120,000), **GRC Analyst (Governance, Risk, Compliance)** ($80,000-$130,000), and **Security Compliance Manager** ($95,000-$150,000). With your background in Risk Management Framework (RMF), COMSEC, and security assessments, you're positioned for roles that companies struggle to fill. Timeline to employment: 30-60 days, especially with cleared positions.

## What You Actually Do as a Cyber Surety Specialist
You're the Air Force's cybersecurity compliance expert. While other cyber AFSCs focus on hands-on defense, you ensure systems meet security standards before they're ever connected to the network. You've processed System Security Plans, conducted security assessments, and guided programs through the RMF authorization process.

Your daily work involves eMASS documentation, STIGs, vulnerability management, and COMSEC accountability. You've briefed commanders on security posture, managed COMSEC accounts, and conducted security inspections. You understand the intersection of policy and technology in ways that pure IT professionals often don't.

The compliance expertise you've developed is increasingly valuable. Every company handling government data needs people who understand FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, and the alphabet soup of compliance frameworks. Your ability to translate complex security requirements into actionable steps for technical teams is a skill that commands premium salaries.

## Top 5 Civilian Career Paths

### 1. Information Security Analyst - $75,000-$120,000
This broad role covers security monitoring, policy development, and risk assessment. Your RMF background gives you a structured approach to security that employers value. You'll assess risks, develop security policies, and help organizations maintain their security posture. Senior positions push past $130,000 in major markets.

### 2. GRC Analyst (Governance, Risk, Compliance) - $80,000-$130,000
This is your most direct translation. GRC analysts ensure organizations meet regulatory requirements—exactly what you've been doing with RMF. You'll conduct risk assessments, manage compliance programs, and develop security policies. Defense contractors and financial institutions pay premium salaries for experienced GRC professionals.

### 3. Security Control Assessor (SCA) - $90,000-$140,000
SCAs evaluate whether security controls are properly implemented—a direct application of your RMF assessment experience. This role is especially valuable with government contractors and federal agencies. If you've conducted Security Control Assessments in your military role, you can step directly into this position.

### 4. Information System Security Officer (ISSO) - $85,000-$130,000
ISSOs are responsible for the security posture of specific systems. You'll maintain authorization documentation, monitor compliance, and coordinate with ISSMs on security issues. Your hands-on eMASS experience makes you immediately effective. This role is common in defense contractors and federal agencies.

### 5. COMSEC Manager / Custodian - $70,000-$110,000
If you've managed COMSEC accounts, this specialized role offers stable employment. Defense contractors and government agencies need people who understand cryptographic material handling, key management, and NSA compliance requirements. It's a niche field with less competition.

## Certifications That Accelerate Your Transition

### CompTIA Security+
- **Cost:** $392
- **Study time:** 4-6 weeks
- **Why it matters:** DoD 8570 baseline requirement. You likely already have this. If not, it's the minimum ticket to cleared security positions.

### Certified Authorization Professional (CAP)
- **Cost:** $599
- **Study time:** 6-8 weeks
- **Why it matters:** ISC2 certification specifically for authorization and RMF processes. Directly validates your 3D0X3 experience. Less common than CISSP, which can make you stand out.

### Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
- **Cost:** $749
- **Study time:** 3-6 months
- **Why it matters:** The gold standard security certification. Requires 5 years experience (4 with degree). Opens doors to senior positions and significantly increases salary potential.

### Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)
- **Cost:** $760 (ISACA members) / $760 (non-members)
- **Study time:** 3-4 months
- **Why it matters:** Management-focused security certification. Excellent for those targeting leadership roles in security governance.

### GIAC Security Leadership (GSLC)
- **Cost:** $2,499
- **Study time:** 6-8 weeks
- **Why it matters:** Combines technical and management security knowledge. Validates leadership capability in security roles.

## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**Thinking Compliance is "Boring":** Some 3D0X3s wish they'd done more "hands-on" cyber work. Don't undervalue your skills—compliance professionals often out-earn SOC analysts, and the work-life balance is typically better.

**Not Pursuing CISSP:** Yes, it's a challenging exam. But CISSP opens doors to positions paying $20,000-$30,000 more annually. Start studying before you separate.

**Underestimating Private Sector Compliance:** Financial services, healthcare, and tech companies all have massive compliance requirements (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS). Your RMF skills translate to these frameworks. Don't limit yourself to defense contractors.

**Letting Your Clearance Lapse:** With your TS/SCI, you're worth significantly more to employers. Keep it active by landing a cleared position before separation. The difference can be $15,000-$25,000 annually.

**Not Documenting Your Assessment Experience:** Before separating, document every assessment you've conducted, system you've authorized, and program you've supported. You'll need specific examples for interviews.
