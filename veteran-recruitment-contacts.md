## OUTREACH STRATEGY GUIDE

### Initial Connection Approach

1. **LinkedIn Connection Request**
   - Personalize each message
   - Reference specific programs or initiatives they've led
   - Mention mutual connections if any
   - Keep to 300 characters or less

2. **Email Outreach** (when available)
   - Subject: "[Your Military Branch] Veteran | Interest in [Specific Role/Program]"
   - Keep concise (3-4 paragraphs max)
   - Include quantifiable military achievements
   - Reference specific company initiatives

3. **Engagement Before Outreach**
   - Follow their LinkedIn profiles
   - Like and comment on their posts about veteran hiring
   - Share relevant content they post
   - Build familiarity before direct outreach

### Best Practices

- **Research First**: Review their recent LinkedIn posts/articles
- **Find Mutual Connections**: Use LinkedIn's "2nd degree" connections
- **Timing**: Reach out on Tuesday-Thursday mornings (better response rates)
- **Follow-Up**: Wait 1 week, then polite follow-up if no response
- **Value Proposition**: Lead with what you offer, not what you need
- **Military Translation**: Clearly translate your MOS/AFSC to civilian terms

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Generic mass messages
- Asking for favors without building relationship
- Not researching the company's veteran initiatives
- Focusing only on what you need vs. what you offer
- Neglecting to mention specific programs (shows lack of research)
