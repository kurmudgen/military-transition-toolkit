EMAIL 1: Starting Your VA Claim the Right Way
Send: Day 0 (upon entering VA claims workflow)
Subject Line: VA claims 101: What they don't tell you
Preview Text: Most veterans get this wrong. Here's the right way...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Your VA claim could be worth $50K+ per year for life.

Most veterans treat it like paperwork. Fill out a form, submit it, hope for the best.

That's why most veterans get lowballed. They get 30% when they should get 70%. They get $466/month when they should get $1,788/month.

**Here's what you need to understand:**

The VA doesn't work for you. They work for the VA budget. Their job is to grant what's proven, not to help you prove it.

**That's your job.**

You have to prove three things:
1. **You have a current disability** (it exists right now)
2. **It happened during service** (service connection)
3. **It's as severe as you say** (medical evidence)

Mess up any of those three? Denied.

**The right way to approach VA claims:**

Think of it like a legal case. You're the prosecutor. The VA is the jury. You need to present overwhelming evidence that leaves no room for doubt.

- Medical records that document the condition
- Service records that show when/how it happened
- Current medical opinions that confirm severity
- Lay evidence from people who witnessed it
- Personal statements that explain the impact

More evidence = higher ratings = more money.

Over the next 30 days, I'm going to walk you through exactly how to build that case.

Let's get you what you've earned.

EMAIL 2: Evidence Gathering—What You Actually Need
Send: Day 3 at 10:00 AM
Subject Line: The evidence that wins VA claims
Preview Text: Here's what actually moves the needle on ratings...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

"I filed my claim but didn't include much evidence. The VA can get my records, right?"

Wrong.

The VA can request your service medical records. But they won't hunt down civilian doctors, track down buddy statements, or dig through deployment records to help your case.

**You have to bring the evidence.**

**Three types of evidence that matter:**

**1. Medical Evidence (Most Important)**
- Service medical records showing treatment during service
- VA medical records (if you've been seen at VA)
- Civilian medical records (if you sought outside treatment)
- Current diagnosis from a doctor
- Nexus letter (doctor's opinion linking condition to service)

**2. Service Connection Evidence**
- Incident reports or safety reports
- Deployment records
- Unit logs or daily journals
- Awards or citations that mention the incident
- Any documentation showing you were there when it happened

**3. Lay Evidence**
- Buddy letters from people who served with you
- Spouse/family statements about how condition affects you
- Your personal statement (when it started, how it impacts your life)
- Photos or videos showing the severity

**What makes strong evidence:**

❌ "My knee hurts sometimes."
✓ "Medical records from 2018 showing torn meniscus during training. Continued treatment through 2021. Current MRI shows degenerative damage. Daily pain limits ability to walk more than 20 minutes."

See the difference?

Details. Documentation. Specifics.

Start gathering this stuff now. You'll need it when you file.

EMAIL 3: Service Connection—Proving It Happened in Service
Send: Day 6 at 11:00 AM
Subject Line: No service connection = No rating (here's how to prove it)
Preview Text: The #1 reason VA claims get denied...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

The #1 reason VA claims get denied: **Lack of service connection.**

You can have a serious disability. You can have medical records proving it exists. But if you can't prove it happened during service or was caused by service?

Denied.

**Three ways to establish service connection:**

**1. Direct Service Connection**
The condition started during service and you have proof.

Example: You injured your knee during a training exercise in 2017. There's an incident report. You went to sick call. It's documented in your medical records.

That's direct service connection.

**2. Presumptive Service Connection**
Certain conditions are automatically presumed to be service-connected if you served in specific places or times.

Examples:
- PTSD for combat veterans
- Chronic diseases within 1 year of discharge
- Conditions related to Agent Orange, burn pits, radiation

Check the VA's presumptive conditions list. If you qualify, you don't have to prove the connection—it's automatic.

**3. Secondary Service Connection**
A condition that was caused by an already service-connected disability.

Example: You have a service-connected knee injury (30%). That knee injury caused you to alter your gait, which led to chronic back pain (20%).

The back pain is secondary to the knee injury. You can claim it.

**How to prove service connection:**

**Option 1: In-service documentation**
Best case: It's in your service medical records. They treated you for it while you were in.

**Option 2: Nexus letter**
A doctor writes a letter saying "It is at least as likely as not that this condition is related to military service."

**Option 3: Lay statements**
Buddy letters from people who were there when you got injured. Your own statement describing what happened.

No service connection = no claim. Get this right.

EMAIL 4: Medical Evidence—The Make-or-Break Factor
Send: Day 9 at 2:00 PM
Subject Line: Why veterans with worse injuries get lower ratings
Preview Text: It's not about how bad it is. It's about what you can prove...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

I've seen a guy with a destroyed knee get 10%.

I've seen a guy with occasional knee pain get 50%.

What's the difference?

**Medical evidence.**

The first guy: "Yeah, my knee's messed up from service. Hurts pretty much all the time."
No recent medical appointments. No documentation. Just his word.

The second guy: Full medical file. MRI results. Doctor's notes describing range of motion limitations. Treatment history. Physical therapy records. Nexus letter connecting it to service.

The VA doesn't rate based on how you feel. They rate based on what you can prove.

**Medical evidence that wins claims:**

**1. Recent medical appointments**
Seen a doctor in the last 6 months? That's current evidence.
Haven't seen a doctor in 5 years? The VA assumes it's not that bad.

**2. Diagnostic tests**
X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, sleep studies, psychological evaluations
Objective proof that something is wrong.

**3. Treatment records**
Medications prescribed. Physical therapy. Surgery. Mental health counseling.
If you're seeking treatment, it shows severity.

**4. Range of motion measurements**
For orthopedic issues, specific measurements matter.
"Limited range of motion" is vague. "Flexion to 45 degrees (normal is 130)" is specific.

**5. Nexus letters**
A doctor's opinion linking your current condition to service.
"It is at least as likely as not that this condition is related to military service."

**What to do right now:**

If you have a condition you plan to claim, see a doctor NOW. Get it documented. Get current evidence.

Waiting until after you file? You're leaving money on the table.

EMAIL 5: Secondary Conditions—Money You're Leaving Behind
Send: Day 12 at 10:00 AM
Subject Line: Secondary conditions could double your rating
Preview Text: Most veterans don't know these are claimable...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Most veterans file for their obvious injuries.

Bad knee. Hearing loss. PTSD.

They get their rating and move on.

**What they miss: Secondary conditions.**

These are conditions caused by your service-connected disabilities. And they're worth as much as your primaries.

**Common secondary conditions veterans miss:**

**Primary: PTSD** (50%)
**Secondaries:**
- Sleep apnea (caused by PTSD) → 50%
- Depression (caused by PTSD) → 30%
- Erectile dysfunction (caused by PTSD or medications) → 0-20%
- Migraines (caused by PTSD stress) → 30%

**Combined rating could be: 80-90%**

**Primary: Knee injury** (10%)
**Secondaries:**
- Back pain (from altered gait) → 20%
- Hip problems (from compensating) → 10%
- Opposite knee issues (from overuse) → 10%

**Combined rating could be: 40-50%**

**Primary: Tinnitus** (10%)
**Secondaries:**
- Anxiety (from constant ringing) → 10%
- Sleep disorder (from inability to sleep due to ringing) → 30%

**Combined rating could be: 40%**

**How to identify your secondaries:**

1. Look at each service-connected condition
2. Ask: "What other problems does this cause?"
3. Research common secondary conditions for that primary
4. Get medical evidence linking the secondary to the primary

**The money difference:**

One primary at 30% = $524/month
Add three secondaries = Combined 70% = $1,788/month

Difference: $1,264/month = $15,168/year = $379,200 over 25 years

Worth researching? Absolutely.

EMAIL 6: C&P Exam Preparation—What to Expect
Send: Day 15 at 1:00 PM
Subject Line: Your C&P exam determines your rating (prep now)
Preview Text: What happens in the exam and how to prepare...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

After you file, you'll get scheduled for a C&P exam (Compensation & Pension).

This exam determines your rating. The examiner's report goes directly to the rater who decides your percentage.

**Screw up the exam = Low rating.**

**Here's what actually happens:**

**1. Review phase (5-10 min)**
Examiner reads your file and claim

**2. Interview (15-20 min)**
They ask about your symptoms, frequency, severity, and impact on daily life

**3. Physical exam (10-20 min)**
They examine the condition (range of motion, reflexes, etc.)

**4. Report writing**
They document findings and submit to the VA

**Common mistakes that cost veterans money:**

❌ **Downplaying symptoms**
"My knee bothers me sometimes, but I can usually work through it."
(Translation to examiner: Mild condition, minimal impact)

✓ **Honest about worst days**
"My knee pain flares 3-4 times per week. On bad days, I can't walk more than 10 minutes without severe pain. I can't run or squat at all."
(Shows frequency and severity)

❌ **Forgetting details**
"I hurt it sometime in 2015, I think? At some training thing."
(Sounds uncertain and unreliable)

✓ **Specific facts**
"I injured it during a ruck march in June 2015 at Fort Bragg. I went to sick call on June 12th. I was prescribed ibuprofen and given profile."
(Specific, verifiable, credible)

❌ **Being stoic**
"It's not that bad. I can handle it."
(This isn't a toughness test. They need to know real limitations)

✓ **Honest about impact**
"I can't play with my kids on the floor. I can't stand for more than 30 minutes. I have to ice it every night."
(Shows real impact on quality of life)

**How to prepare:**

1. Review your claim before the exam
2. Write down all symptoms and frequency
3. Bring documentation (it's allowed)
4. Describe your worst days, not average days
5. Be honest about limitations
6. Don't minimize or exaggerate

The examiner is not your enemy. They're just gathering information. Give them accurate information to work with.

EMAIL 7: After You File—What Happens Next
Send: Day 18 at 10:30 AM
Subject Line: You filed your claim. Now what?
Preview Text: Timeline and next steps after VA claim submission...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You filed your claim. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

VA claims take time. The average is 120-180 days from filing to decision. Some take longer.

**Here's the process:**

**Phase 1: Claim received (Week 1)**
The VA acknowledges they got your claim. You'll see this in your VA.gov account.

**Phase 2: Initial review (Weeks 2-4)**
They review your claim and determine what evidence they need.

**Phase 3: Evidence gathering (Weeks 4-12)**
They request your service records. They schedule your C&P exam(s). They review any evidence you submitted.

**Phase 4: C&P exams (Weeks 8-16)**
You attend exams for each claimed condition. Examiner submits reports.

**Phase 5: Preparation for decision (Weeks 12-20)**
A rater reviews all evidence and exams. They determine your rating for each condition.

**Phase 6: Decision (Weeks 16-24+)**
You receive your rating decision. It shows each condition and the percentage granted.

**What you should do while waiting:**

✓ **Check your VA.gov account weekly** for status updates
✓ **Respond immediately** if they request more evidence
✓ **Track your claim** in our VA Claims Tracker
✓ **Prepare for C&P exams** when scheduled
✓ **Continue gathering evidence** (you can submit supplemental evidence)

✗ **Don't call every day** (it won't speed things up)
✗ **Don't assume denial** if it's taking long (delays are normal)
✗ **Don't give up** if it seems like nothing's happening

**If you get a request for more evidence:**

Submit it FAST. The quicker you respond, the quicker the decision.

**If your claim is taking longer than 6 months:**

You can call VA at 1-800-827-1000 and ask about the status. Be polite but persistent.

The waiting sucks. But it's part of the process.

Stay patient. Stay on top of it.

EMAIL 8: Handling a VA Denial the Right Way
Send: Day 21 at 2:00 PM
Subject Line: Your claim got denied. Here's what to do.
Preview Text: Denial isn't final. Here's how to fight back...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You got your decision letter. Some conditions were granted. Others were denied.

Or maybe everything was denied.

**First: Don't panic.**

VA denials are incredibly common. About 30% of initial claims get partially or fully denied.

**And denials aren't final.** You have options.

**Why claims get denied:**

1. **Insufficient medical evidence** (most common)
2. **No service connection established**
3. **Condition doesn't meet rating criteria**
4. **Missing C&P exam or poor exam documentation**

**Your three options after denial:**

**Option 1: Supplemental Claim**
Submit new evidence you didn't include in your original claim.

Best for: Cases where you have new medical records, new buddy letters, or evidence you forgot to include.

**Option 2: Higher-Level Review**
A senior VA employee reviews your claim with the same evidence.

Best for: Cases where you think the rater made an error with the evidence you provided.

**Option 3: Appeal to Board of Veterans Appeals**
A VA judge reviews your case.

Best for: Complex cases where you disagree with the VA's interpretation.

**Which option to choose?**

**If you have new evidence:** Supplemental Claim (fastest path)
**If you think they made an error:** Higher-Level Review
**If it's complicated:** Appeal (but expect 1-2 year wait)

**What new evidence looks like:**

- Recent medical appointments since you filed
- Additional buddy letters
- Nexus letter from a private doctor
- Service records you didn't include before
- More detailed personal statement

**Don't give up after a denial.**

I've seen veterans get denied at 0%, file a supplemental claim with better evidence, and get granted at 70%.

The only way you lose is if you stop fighting.

EMAIL 9: Increasing Your Rating—When and How
Send: Day 24 at 11:00 AM
Subject Line: How to increase a low VA rating
Preview Text: Got 30% but think you deserve 70%? Here's how to fight...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You got your rating. 30% for your knee. 10% for tinnitus. 50% for PTSD.

**But you think it should be higher.**

Maybe your knee is worse than 30%. Maybe your PTSD has gotten worse since your C&P exam.

You can request an increase.

**When to request an increase:**

1. **Your condition has worsened** since your last rating
2. **You have new medical evidence** showing greater severity
3. **You think the original rating was wrong** based on the symptoms you described

**How to request an increase:**

**File a claim for increase** (same process as original claim)

You'll need:
- Current medical evidence showing worsening or severity
- Treatment records since your last rating
- Personal statement explaining the impact
- Possibly another C&P exam

**What the VA looks for in increases:**

For most conditions, they use a rating schedule:

**Example: Knee condition**
- 10%: Slight limitation of motion
- 20%: Moderate limitation of motion
- 30%: Severe limitation of motion, pain on use
- 40%: Ankylosis (limited to specific measurements)
- 50%: Ankylosis with severe limitation

If your original rating was 10% but your range of motion now meets the 30% criteria? You should request an increase.

**Timing matters:**

Wait until you have evidence of worsening. Don't file for an increase 2 weeks after your original rating with no new evidence.

But if it's been 6 months and your condition has clearly gotten worse? File.

**The risk:**

Technically, the VA can decrease your rating if the evidence shows improvement. Realistically, this is rare—but it can happen.

**Most veterans are under-rated.** If you genuinely believe your condition is worse than your rating reflects, fight for it.

EMAIL 10: You're Not Done—Ongoing Claim Management
Send: Day 27 at 9:00 AM
Subject Line: VA claims aren't "file and forget"
Preview Text: Ongoing management strategies for life...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You filed your claim. You got your rating. You're receiving monthly compensation.

**Now what?**

Your VA claim isn't done. It's ongoing for life.

**Why ongoing management matters:**

1. **Conditions worsen over time** (you can request increases)
2. **New secondary conditions develop** (you can file for these)
3. **VA makes errors** (you need to catch them)
4. **Benefits change** (you need to stay informed)

**Your ongoing VA claim strategy:**

**Annual review (every 12 months):**
- Have your conditions worsened?
- Have new secondary conditions appeared?
- Are you being properly compensated?
- Do you need to file for an increase?

**Track your conditions:**
- Keep a symptom journal
- Document any worsening
- Continue seeing doctors regularly
- Gather evidence continuously

**File for new secondaries as they develop:**
If your service-connected PTSD causes sleep apnea 5 years after your original claim? File for it as a secondary condition.

**Stay on top of VA correspondence:**
The VA may schedule you for re-evaluations. They may request updated information. Respond quickly.

**Connect with other veterans:**
Join veteran communities. Learn from others who've been through the process. Share your knowledge.

**Use your benefits:**
You've earned them. VA healthcare, education benefits, state benefits—use what you're entitled to.

**The long-term view:**

Your VA rating could increase over time as conditions worsen or new secondaries develop. A veteran who starts at 50% might end up at 80% or 90% over 10-20 years.

But only if they stay engaged with the process.

This isn't "file and forget." It's "file and manage for life."

You've done the hard part—getting your initial rating. Now maintain it and optimize it over time.
