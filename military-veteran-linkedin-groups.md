   - "military transition"
   - "veteran careers"
   - Your specific branch (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard)
   - Your target industry + "veterans"
   - Your military specialty or MOS

2. **Check the "Groups" tab** on company pages of:
   - Defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, etc.)
   - Veteran service organizations
   - Companies with veteran hiring programs

3. **Use LinkedIn Premium for Veterans**
   - Free 1-year subscription available for eligible veterans via ID.me
   - Enhanced search capabilities
   - Access to LinkedIn Learning (10,000+ courses)

4. **Look at "People Also Viewed"** sections when viewing veteran-focused groups

2. **Dynamic Membership:** Group sizes change constantly

## Recommendations for Military Transition Toolkit

To provide accurate, up-to-date information to your users:

1. **Manual Research Required:** Someone with a LinkedIn account would need to:
   - Log in to LinkedIn
   - Search for each group
   - Document current member counts
   - Verify group activity level
   - This data would need periodic updates (quarterly/annually)

2. **Alternative Approach:** Instead of listing by size, consider:
   - Categorizing by purpose (transition, industry-specific, branch-specific, etc.)
   - Highlighting "most active" vs. largest
   - Focusing on quality of resources vs. member count
   - Including official veteran programs (Hiring Our Heroes, VOWS, etc.)

3. **Automation Not Possible:** LinkedIn's Terms of Service prohibit scraping, so automated collection of this data is not feasible

- Manual research by someone with LinkedIn access
- Logging into LinkedIn and searching each group individually
- Documenting the current member count from each group's page
- Understanding that this data becomes outdated quickly

**Estimated Time for Manual Research:** 3-4 hours to find, verify, and document 50 groups with current member counts.
