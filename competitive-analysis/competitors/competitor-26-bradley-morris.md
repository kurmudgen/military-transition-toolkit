**Reasoning:**

- **Comprehensive model:** Recruiting + events + job board
- **Strong employer relationships:** 96% satisfaction, Fortune 1000 partnerships
- **Government recognition:** HIRE Vets Gold Medallion
- **But:** Acknowledged operational challenges
- **And:** Moderate employee satisfaction (62%)
- **Plus:** Technology gaps and timing problems

**Recommended MTT Response:**
- **Solve timing problem:** Real-time matching vs. event-dependent
- **Quality through technology:** AI maintains standards at scale vs. remote workforce issues
- **Radical transparency:** Publish all metrics they don't
- **Active database:** Verify resume freshness
- **Always-on platform:** Continuous vs. periodic opportunities
- **Comprehensive transition:** Career + education + benefits vs. jobs-only
- **Positioning:** "Bradley-Morris finds you a job. MTT prepares you for career success."

**Strategic Positioning:**
MTT can be the modern, transparent, quality-focused alternative to the large but operationally challenged incumbent. Focus on solving the "right time, right place" matching problem they acknowledge struggling with, while adding comprehensive transition support they don't offer.

**Key Insight:** Bradley-Morris/RecruitMilitary's size is both strength and weakness. Their scale attracts employers but creates operational challenges. MTT can use technology to deliver quality at scale without remote workforce limitations, while solving their acknowledged timing gap problem.
