## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Complementary:
1. **Mentorship + tools** - ACP provides mentor, MTT provides resume builder, LinkedIn optimizer, job tracker
2. **VA claims alongside career** - File for benefits while building career with mentor
3. **Peer community** - Connect with other ACP participants beyond 1-on-1
4. **Financial planning** - Optimize $93K salary with benefits, VA claims, savings
5. **Post-mentorship support** - Continue after year ends
6. **Broader career paths** - Support non-corporate tracks ACP doesn't serve well

### Positioning:
**"ACP develops your career, MTT handles everything else"** - Mentorship + VA claims + community + tools

### Key Insight:
ACP mentees are **highly motivated, career-focused** and earning good salaries, but they **still need VA claims** (potential $400-1000/month tax-free) and **comprehensive transition support**. MTT should target ACP participants for holistic transition beyond career.

**Partnership angle:** Official ACP transition platform - provide tools and support that complement mentorship
