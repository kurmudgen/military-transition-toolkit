## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Learn from Veterati:
1. **Sustainable model required** - Free-only doesn't work long-term
2. **Mentor fatigue real** - Unlimited model burned out volunteers
3. **Freemium better** - Free core features, premium for advanced
4. **Tech matters** - Veterati's UX was industry-leading

### Features to Integrate:
1. **Mentor matching** - Add optional mentorship to MTT (not unlimited, but sustainable)
2. **Career advice** - Fill gap left by Veterati shutdown
3. **Community forum** - Peer-to-peer advice when mentors unavailable
4. **Sustainable model** - Free tools + premium coaching

### Positioning:
**"The mentorship Veterati offered + comprehensive transition tools"**

**"Sustainable free platform"** - Core features free forever, premium for intensive support

### Key Insight:
Veterati's **shutdown creates opportunity** for MTT to capture displaced users seeking mentorship. But MTT must **avoid their mistake** - build sustainable model from day one.

**Veterans loved Veterati's concept** but platform couldn't sustain. MTT should offer **"Veterati-lite mentorship"** (limited but sustainable) **PLUS comprehensive tools** Veterati never had (VA claims, state benefits, financial planning).

**Partnership with MilMentor:** Potential to integrate MilMentor's successor platform
