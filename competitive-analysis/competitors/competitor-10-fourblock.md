## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Complementary:
1. **Pre-FourBlock prep** - Help veterans prepare strong applications
2. **Post-graduation support** - VA claims, relocation, benefits after job secured
3. **Year-round access** - MTT available between FourBlock cohorts
4. **Broader audience** - Help veterans FourBlock doesn't serve (non-corporate, non-metro, etc.)
5. **Financial planning** - Optimize $100K salary with benefits, savings, claims
6. **Alumni community** - Ongoing connection after program ends

### Positioning:
**"FourBlock gets the career, MTT handles the rest"** - VA claims, benefits, relocation, long-term financial planning

### Key Insight:
FourBlock grads earning $100K+ **still need VA claims** (could be 20-40% disability = $400-700/month tax-free). MTT should **target FourBlock applicants and alumni** for comprehensive transition beyond career.
