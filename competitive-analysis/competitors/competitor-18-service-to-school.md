## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Complementary:
1. **Serve non-grad school veterans** - 90%+ not pursuing advanced degrees
2. **Pre-S2S exploration** - Help veterans decide IF grad school is right path
3. **Post-admission support** - Relocation, VA claims, financial planning after acceptance
4. **GI Bill optimization** - Calculator showing benefits remaining, ROI of programs
5. **Alternative paths** - Certifications, bootcamps, employment for those not doing grad school
6. **Comprehensive transition** - S2S handles admissions, MTT handles VA claims, state benefits, etc.

### Positioning:
**"All education paths + comprehensive transition"** vs graduate-school-only

**"Before, during, and after grad school"** - Exploration, S2S application support, post-admission transition

### Partnership Opportunity:
**Strong fit** - S2S grad school applicants need:
- VA claims filed before starting school (to maximize benefits)
- GI Bill optimization and comparison tool
- Relocation planning to school location
- Financial planning (living expenses, scholarships, loans)
- State education benefits (beyond GI Bill)

MTT could be **official comprehensive transition platform for S2S applicants**

### Key Insight:
S2S **dominates veteran grad school admissions** but serves **small percentage** (5-10% pursue advanced degrees). MTT should:
1. **Partner with S2S** for grad school track
2. **Serve 90%+ not pursuing grad school** with alternative education (certifications, bootcamps, skills training)
3. **Provide comprehensive support** S2S doesn't offer (VA claims, state benefits, financial planning)

**Strategic angle:**
- **Pre-S2S:** MTT's education planning tools help veterans explore if grad school makes sense
- **During S2S:** MTT handles VA claims, state benefits while S2S handles applications
- **Post-admission:** MTT provides relocation, financial planning for grad school transition
