## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Differentiation:
1. **Free resume builder** - DIY alternative to expensive service
2. **Federal resume templates** - MTT provides format, user fills in
3. **AI-powered military translation** - Automated skills conversion
4. **Resume + everything else** - Comprehensive transition beyond resume
5. **Freemium model** - Basic resume free, expert review optional upgrade
6. **Educational approach** - Teach veterans to write their own vs doing it for them
7. **Continuous updates** - Update resume anytime vs one-time service

### Positioning:
**"Free federal resume builder + comprehensive transition"** vs expensive resume-only service

**"Learn to fish vs buying a fish"** - MTT teaches veterans to write resumes themselves

### Underserved Segments:
- **Budget-conscious veterans** - Can't afford $300-800 for resume
- **DIY learners** - Want to learn skill, not outsource
- **Ongoing resume needs** - Need to update frequently
- **Comprehensive transition seekers** - Need more than just resume

### Key Insight:
CareerProPlus serves **high-end federal job seekers** willing to pay for expertise. MTT should serve **everyone else** with **free tools** that are "good enough" for most veterans, with **optional premium review** for those who want expert eyes ($50-100 vs $300-800).

**Strategic angle:** **"Free federal resume builder"** captures CareerProPlus's potential market before they convert to paid service. Offer **affordable resume review** ($49-99) as freemium upsell - still 70% cheaper than CareerProPlus.
