4. **Lack of transparency:** Publish criteria, success rates, methodologies

### Partnership Opportunities:
**MEDIUM Potential**

**Challenges:**
- Orion may view MTT job resources as competitive

### Is This a Partner, Competitor, or Acquisition Target?

**Hybrid: Partial Competitor + Potential Partner**

**Competitor:**
- Both help veterans find jobs
- Overlapping target audience (transitioning service members)
- May compete for corporate partnerships

**Partner:**
- Orion is high-touch recruiting; MTT is self-service planning
- Orion serves 30-40% who qualify; MTT serves the other 60-70%
- Orion lacks transition planning tools; MTT has them
- Complementary strengths

**Not an acquisition target:** Privately held, profitable, no indication of sale interest

## Key Strategic Insights

1. **Personalized recruiting still has value** in age of LinkedIn/Indeed
2. **Selectivity creates scarcity and premium positioning** but excludes majority
3. **Employer-pays model works** for military recruiting (proven 37 years)
4. **97% retention proves quality matching** matters more than speed
5. **Human recruiters won't be replaced by algorithms** for complex career transitions
6. **MTT should serve the veterans Orion rejects** (60-70% of applicants)

## Competitive Threat Level: MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**

- Employment is core value proposition for both
- Orion's high-touch model appeals to some veterans

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Orion is selective (MTT serves everyone)

- Differentiate on accessibility (serve ALL veterans)
- Differentiate on scope (employment + benefits + education + planning)
- Build technology Orion doesn't have (mobile app, calculators, tools)
- Target veterans who want self-service (not recruiter dependency)

**Market Positioning:**
