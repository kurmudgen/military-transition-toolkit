## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Complementary:
1. **Serve employment seekers** - 90%+ of veterans vs entrepreneurs
2. **Entrepreneur side hustle** - Support veterans exploring entrepreneurship WHILE job searching
3. **Financial planning** - Business + VA claims + personal finance
4. **Comprehensive transition** - Bunker Labs handles business, MTT handles everything else
5. **Pre-entrepreneur resources** - Help veterans explore entrepreneurship before committing

### Positioning:
**"Employment + entrepreneurship options"** vs entrepreneurship-only

**"Comprehensive transition for all paths"** - Job search OR entrepreneurship OR both

### Partnership Opportunity:
**Strong potential** - Bunker Labs entrepreneurs still need:
- VA disability claims (business income + disability benefits)
- Healthcare navigation (entrepreneur health insurance complex)
- State benefits (business licenses, veteran entrepreneur benefits)
- Financial planning (business finances + personal finances)

MTT could be **official comprehensive transition platform for Bunker Labs entrepreneurs**

### Key Insight:
Bunker Labs **dominates veteran entrepreneurship** but serves **tiny percentage** (5-10% of veterans). MTT should:
1. **Partner with Bunker Labs** for entrepreneur track
2. **Serve 90%+ seeking employment**
3. **Provide comprehensive transition** Bunker Labs doesn't (VA claims, benefits, healthcare)

**Strategic angle:** Integrate Bunker Labs' Launch Lab into MTT entrepreneurship track, MTT provides comprehensive support (VA claims, benefits, financial planning) for Bunker Labs entrepreneurs
