# Updated Product Roadmap: Military Transition Toolkit
## Based on 50+ Competitor Analysis

**Last Updated:** November 2025
**Planning Horizon:** 24 months
**Methodology:** Gap analysis from 50+ competitors + user needs mapping

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

**Build Based on Competitive Gaps, Not Feature Parity**

After analyzing 50+ competitors, we've identified where MTT should:
- ✅ **Build** (unique features no competitor has)
- 🤝 **Partner** (competitors excel, we integrate)
- ❌ **Avoid** (commoditized features with low differentiation)

---

## TIER 1: Critical Gaps (Must Build to Compete)

**Timeline:** Months 1-6
**Priority:** HIGHEST
**Goal:** Table stakes + unique differentiators

### Feature 1.1: State Benefits Comparison Tool 🌟 UNIQUE
**Gap:** NO competitor aggregates state veteran benefits across all 50 states
**Competitor Analysis:**
- MOAA: Lobbies state-by-state but doesn't compare
- Government: Each state has own website (no aggregation)
- Others: National focus only

**Build:**
- Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Top 10 states (TX, FL, CA, VA, NC, GA, WA, CO, AZ, SC)
  - Income tax exemptions
  - Property tax breaks
  - Education benefits
  - State veteran hiring preference
- Phase 2 (Month 3-6): All 50 states + DC
  - Sales tax
  - Healthcare programs
  - Business incentives
  - License plates, hunting/fishing licenses
  - Parks/recreation access
- Phase 3 (Month 6+): Interactive features
  - "Best state for you" wizard
  - Side-by-side comparison (2-5 states)
  - Relocation calculator (net income after taxes/benefits)
  - Map visualization

**Why Critical:**
- Only MTT has this (defensible moat)
- High-value premium conversion driver
- SEO goldmine ("best states for veterans")
- Press-worthy (annual state rankings report)

**Success Metrics:**
- 10,000+ monthly state comparison searches
- 30%+ free-to-premium conversion on this feature
- Featured snippet on Google for "best states for veterans"

---

### Feature 1.2: Mobile App (iOS + Android) 📱 COMPETITIVE MOAT
**Gap:** No good military transition mobile apps
**Competitor Analysis:**
- RallyPoint: DISCONTINUED app
- Together We Served: "Browser wrapper" (2.5★ rating)
- ALL training platforms: Zero mobile apps
- ALL government: Zero mobile apps
- Team RWB: Only good app (4.8★) but wellness-only, no career tools

**Build:**
- React Native (code reuse from web)
- Expo for rapid deployment

**MVP Features (Month 1-3):**
- Retirement calculator
- State benefits comparison (top 10)
- Basic MOS translation
- Resource library
- Timeline/checklist generator
- Offline mode with local storage (privacy-first)

**V2 Features (Month 4-6):**
- Premium subscription in-app purchase
- VA claims builder (guided)
- Resume builder
- Job board integration
- Push notifications (personalized milestones)

**Why Critical:**
- MAJOR competitive advantage (only comprehensive transition app)
- Mobile-first = younger veteran preference
- Offline mode = deployed/underway access
- Hard for competitors to catch up (RallyPoint gave up, TWS failed)

**Success Metrics:**
- 4.5+ star rating (App Store + Google Play)
- 10,000+ downloads in 6 months
- 50%+ monthly active users
- Featured in "Veterans" app category

---

### Feature 1.3: AI-Powered MOS Translation 🤖 TECHNOLOGY EDGE
**Gap:** Existing tools are static keyword matching (ClearedJobs, Walmart, Home Depot)
**Competitor Analysis:**
- Static tools: Limited to direct MOS-to-job mapping
- No personalization: Same output for all E-5s with same MOS
- No career path guidance: Just job titles, not pathways

**Build:**
- OpenAI API integration (GPT-4)
- Input: MOS/rating, rank, years of service, security clearance, education, location preference
- Output:
  - Top 20 civilian career matches (vs. competitors' top 5)
  - Career pathway recommendations (entry → mid → senior level)
  - Required certifications for each path
  - Salary ranges by location
  - Job market demand data

**Free Tier:** Top 5 matches (competitive with others)
**Premium Tier:** Top 20 matches + career paths + certifications

**Why Critical:**
- AI = better matches than competitors' static tools
- Personalization = higher accuracy
- Premium upsell driver
- Continuous improvement (model learns from user feedback)

**Success Metrics:**
- 90%+ user satisfaction with matches
- 40% use translation tool → upgrade to premium
- 1,000+ translations per month

---

### Feature 1.4: Verified Employer Reviews 🏢 TRUST BUILDER
**Gap:** Military Friendly is self-reported; no Glassdoor equivalent for veteran employment
**Competitor Analysis:**
- Military Friendly: Organizations self-report (potential inflation)
- No accountability: 22-45% of veterans report "military-friendly" employers didn't meet expectations
- No retention tracking: Employers aren't held to outcomes

**Build:**
- Veteran employee review platform
- 5-star rating + written review
- Categories: Skills translation support, onboarding, growth, culture, retention
- Verification: DD214 or military email
- Anonymous option available

**MTT Accountability Score (100-point scale):**
- Veteran review average: 40%
- 1-year retention rate: 30%
- 2-year retention rate: 20%
- Career advancement (promotions/raises): 10%

**Launch Strategy:**
- Target 10 major employers (Walmart, JPMorgan, Home Depot, Amazon, Lockheed, Boeing, USAA, Raytheon, Booz Allen, CACI)
- Recruit 20 reviews per employer (200 reviews total in first 90 days)
- Display Accountability Score on employer pages

**Why Critical:**
- Solves major pain point (employer authenticity)
- No competitor verifies employer claims
- Two-sided marketplace driver (employers engage to improve scores)
- PR opportunity (annual "Best Employers" report)

**Success Metrics:**
- 500+ verified reviews in 6 months
- 25+ employers scored
- Press coverage in Military Times or Stars & Stripes
- 10+ employers pay for premium placement to improve visibility

---

### Feature 1.5: VA Claims Builder (Guided) 🎖️ HIGH-VALUE PREMIUM
**Gap:** VA.gov is complex; no simplified guided builder exists
**Competitor Analysis:**
- VA.gov: Official but overwhelming (100+ forms, complex process)
- MOAA: Guidance articles only (not interactive tool)
- VSOs: 1-on-1 help but limited scalability

**Build:**
- Step-by-step wizard for common claims:
  - Disability compensation
  - Healthcare enrollment
  - Education benefits (GI Bill)
  - Home loan certificate of eligibility
  - Vocational rehabilitation
- Document checklist (DD214, medical records, service records)
- Form pre-population (extract data from uploaded DD214)
- Submission-ready PDFs
- VSO referral for complex cases

**Free Tier:** Basic guidance + document checklist
**Premium Tier:** Guided builder + form pre-fill + PDF generation

**Why Critical:**
- High-value premium driver (claims worth $thousands)
- Complex = defensible (hard to replicate)
- Ongoing value (veterans file multiple claims over time)
- Partnership opportunity with VSOs

**Success Metrics:**
- 1,000+ claims initiated through MTT in 6 months
- 50% of premium users use claims builder
- 80%+ success rate for claims filed with MTT help
- Partnerships with 3+ VSOs for referrals

### Feature 2.2: Spouse Co-Planning Tools 👥

**Build:**
- Dual-career optimization (veteran + spouse job search same city)
- Military spouse employment resources (portable careers, remote work, relocation support)
- Household financial planning (combined retirement + benefits)

**Complexity:** Low-Medium (mostly content + existing tool adaptation)
**Impact:** High (1M+ military spouses, 21% unemployment rate)

**Build:**

**Timeline:** Months 6-12
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Goal:** Build sustainable competitive moat

### Feature 3.1: Self-Paced Tech Training 💻
**Gap:** Code Platoon is $20K and 46 grads/year; VET TEC unavailable until 10/2025
**Strategy:** Partner first, build later
- **Phase 1 (Month 6-9):** License Codecademy for Veterans ($10/month, MTT takes 30% commission)
- **Phase 2 (Month 9-12):** Custom MTT curriculum ($49/month, 100% margin)
- Tracks: Web Development, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, Cloud, PM

**Complexity:** High (curriculum development)
**Impact:** High (recurring revenue, job placement outcomes)
**Partner:** Codecademy, Udemy, or build custom

---

**Timeline:** Month 8-12 (requires user base)

---

## TIER 4: Long-Term Bets (12-24 Months)

**Impact:** Very High (market validation, systemic change, mission)
**Timeline:** Month 12+ (build data first)

---

## Features to AVOID (Low ROI or Commoditized)

### ❌ Don't Build: In-Person Training Programs
**Why:** Code Platoon, Hiring Our Heroes, Boots to Business excel here; hard to scale; capital-intensive
**Strategy:** Partner and refer instead

### ❌ Don't Build: Job Fair Events (Initially)
**Why:** GI Jobs, Hiring Our Heroes, Corporate Gray dominate; expensive to execute
**Strategy:** Virtual fairs only (Month 12+); partner with existing events

### ❌ Don't Build: Magazine/Publication
**Why:** MOAA's Military Officer magazine is established; declining media relevance
**Strategy:** Blog + digital content only

### ❌ Don't Build: Generalized Social Network
**Why:** RallyPoint tried and failed (discontinued app); LinkedIn is dominant
**Strategy:** Focused mentor matching + community forums only (not full social network)

### ❌ Don't Build: Structured Advocacy Organization
**Why:** MOAA has 95 years head start, federal charter; extremely hard to replicate
**Strategy:** Partner with MOAA, VFW, DAV for advocacy needs

## Competitive Feature Roadmap

**Where We'll Match Competitors:**
- ✅ Resume builder (like Orion, Walmart)
- ✅ Job board (like GI Jobs, ClearedJobs)
- ✅ Resource library (like MOAA, government)
- ✅ Community forums (like RallyPoint, Operation Code)

**Where We'll Exceed Competitors:**
- 🌟 Mobile app (better than RallyPoint's discontinued app, TRWB's wellness-only app)
- 🌟 State benefits comparison (UNIQUE - nobody has this)
- 🌟 AI personalization (better than competitors' static tools)
- 🌟 Privacy-first (unique local storage approach)
- 🌟 Verified employer accountability (better than Military Friendly self-reported)

**Where We'll Partner (Not Build):**
- 🤝 Structured training (partner with Code Platoon, VET TEC)
- 🤝 Elite recruiting (partner with Orion, Cameron-Brooks)
- 🤝 Advocacy (partner with MOAA, SVA, VFW)
- 🤝 In-person events (partner with Hiring Our Heroes, Corporate Gray)

---

## CONCLUSION

This roadmap is designed to:
1. ✅ **Build unique features** competitors lack (state benefits, mobile app, verified reviews)
2. ✅ **Match table stakes** where necessary (job board, resources, community)
3. ✅ **Partner strategically** on commoditized features (training, recruiting, advocacy)
4. ✅ **Prioritize ruthlessly** (TIER 1 critical gaps first)
5. ✅ **Generate revenue early** (premium tier Month 6, employers Month 8)
6. ✅ **Scale sustainably** (bootstrap to $360K ARR, then raise seed for growth)

**The competitive analysis is clear:** Veterans need comprehensive, mobile-first, privacy-focused transition planning. NO competitor delivers this. MTT will.

**Execute this roadmap, and MTT becomes the category-defining military transition platform within 24 months.**
