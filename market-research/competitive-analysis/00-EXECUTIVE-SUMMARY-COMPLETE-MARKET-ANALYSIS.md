- Community: RallyPoint/TRWB
- Benefits: VA.gov
- State info: Manual research

**MTT Solution:** All-in-one platform with career + education + benefits + state comparison + VA claims + retirement planning

**MTT Solution:** Comprehensive state benefits comparison tool (unique differentiator)

### 7. Privacy-First Architecture

**Problem:** Most competitors:
- Collect extensive user data

- Estimate 240,000 annual separations × 1.5 years planning window = **360,000 active planners**
- Percentage seeking comprehensive planning tools: 60-70% = **216,000-252,000**

**Recently Separated Veterans (0-5 years):**
- 240,000 × 5 years = **1.2 million** recent veterans
- Percentage still seeking career/benefits optimization: 40% = **480,000**

**Total SAM:** 216K-252K (active) + 480K (recent) = **~700,000 potential MTT users**

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Conservative Market Share Targets:**
- Year 1: 1% of SAM = 7,000 users
- Year 2: 3% of SAM = 21,000 users
- Year 3: 5% of SAM = 35,000 users
- Year 5: 10% of SAM = 70,000 users

- Year 3: 35,000 users × 20% × $10/mo × 12 = $840,000
- Year 5: 70,000 users × 20% × $10/mo × 12 = $1,680,000

- Year 5: 200 employers × $300/mo × 12 = $720,000

**Total Year 5 Revenue Potential:** $1.68M (subscription) + $720K (B2B) = **$2.4M annually**

## Strategic Recommendations

### TIER 1: Critical Must-Haves (Competitive Parity)

4. **Inclusive Access** - Serve ALL veterans (not selective like MOAA, Cameron-Brooks, Breakline)
5. **Privacy Protection** - Local storage vs. data collection (unique differentiator)

### TIER 2: Quick Wins (1-2 Months)

1. **State Benefits Comparison Tool** - NO competitor has this (unique)
2. **AI-Powered MOS Translation** - Better than static tools (ClearedJobs, Walmart)
3. **Verified Employer Reviews** - Community-driven vs. self-reported (Military Friendly)
4. **Spouse Co-Planning** - Dual-career optimization (underserved by all)
5. **Timeline/Checklist Generator** - Personalized vs. generic TAP

### TIER 3: Strategic Differentiators (3-6 Months)

## Partnership Strategy

### HIGH Priority Partnerships

**1. Government Resources**
- DOL VETS: Official digital TAP enhancement
- SBA VBOC: Entrepreneurship toolkit integration
- State Veteran Affairs: Official state benefits platform

**Rationale:** Don't compete with free government; become official digital layer

**2. MOAA**
- MTT serves enlisted; MOAA serves officers
- Cross-referral: MTT transition planning → MOAA post-transition advocacy
- Co-branded officer resources

**Rationale:** Complementary audiences, non-competitive

**3. Boots to Business / VBOCs**
- MTT promotes B2B to entrepreneurship-minded users
- VBOCs recommend MTT toolkit to veteran clients
- Integrated entrepreneurship pathway

**Rationale:** Both serve veterans; different focus areas

### MEDIUM Priority Partnerships

**4. Team Red White & Blue**
- TRWB: Health/wellness focus (4.8★ app, 250K members)
- MTT: Career/transition focus
- Integrated wellness + career platform

**Rationale:** Highly complementary; TRWB has zero career tools

**5. Operation Code**
- Largest veteran tech community (13.5K Slack members)
- MTT provides structured curriculum; OpCode provides community
- Mutual referrals

**Rationale:** OpCode has community but no structure; MTT has structure

**6. Orion Talent / Cameron-Brooks**
- They refer rejected candidates (60-85%) to MTT
- MTT prepares candidates for their screening
- Pipeline development partnership

**Rationale:** They serve elite; MTT serves everyone

### LOW Priority (Monitor)

**7. GI Jobs / Military Friendly**
- Owned by same company (VIQTORY)
- May view MTT as competitive
- Use public data; don't partner

**8. Corporate Programs (Walmart, JPMorgan, Home Depot)**
- Direct employer partnerships more valuable
- Aggregate their opportunities in MTT platform
- Don't need partnership; just list their programs
