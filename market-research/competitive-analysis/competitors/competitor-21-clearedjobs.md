### Is This a Partner, Competitor, or Acquisition Target?

**Partner** - Complementary services
- ClearedJobs excels at niche job board for cleared positions
- MTT excels at comprehensive transition planning
- Non-overlapping core value propositions
- Both serve veterans but different needs

**Not an acquisition target:** Owned by $13B Recruit Holdings (out of MTT's reach)

## Key Strategic Insights

1. **Cleared veterans are high-value segment:** Higher salaries ($80K-$150K+), specialized skills, immediate employability
2. **Technology matters:** ClearedJobs' lack of mobile app is glaring weakness in 2025
3. **Job board alone is not enough:** Veterans need holistic transition support
4. **Specialization works:** ClearedJobs carved out defensible niche despite LinkedIn/Indeed competition

## Competitive Threat Level: LOW

**Reasoning:**
