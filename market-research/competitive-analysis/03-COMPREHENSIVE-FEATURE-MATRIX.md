## MARKET GAPS (Unmet Needs)

**Problem:** Veterans use 4-7 separate platforms
**Who's Trying:** Nobody
**MTT Solution:** All-in-one (career + benefits + education + state + planning)

### Gap #2: Modern Mobile Technology
**Problem:** No good mobile apps (RP discontinued, TWS is wrapper, all training desktop-only)
**Who's Trying:** Team RWB (but wellness-only, no career)
**MTT Solution:** Mobile-first React app with full feature parity

### Gap #3: Transparency & Accountability
**Problem:** Self-reported employer data, no verified outcomes, hidden metrics
**Who's Trying:** Military Friendly (but self-reported + EY audits calculations not source data)
**MTT Solution:** Veteran-verified reviews, outcomes tracking, transparent metrics

### Gap #4: Inclusive Access
**Problem:** MOAA officers-only, Cameron-Brooks top 15%, Breakline selective, WWP injured-only
**Who's Trying:** Most are free, but with other restrictions
**MTT Solution:** Serve ALL veterans regardless of rank, education, injury, selectivity

### Gap #5: State-Level Intelligence
**Problem:** National focus only; no state comparison
**Who's Trying:** MOAA lobbies by state, but doesn't aggregate/compare benefits
**MTT Solution:** Comprehensive 50-state benefits comparison tool

### Gap #6: Ongoing Support
**Problem:** Services end at transition (TAP), placement (Orion), or graduation (Code Platoon)
**Who's Trying:** MOAA (but paid membership)
**MTT Solution:** Lifetime free platform access

### Gap #7: Privacy Protection
**Problem:** Data collection, selling to employers, tracking
**Who's Trying:** Nobody
