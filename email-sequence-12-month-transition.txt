EMAIL 1: One Year Out—Your Master Plan Starts Now
Send: 12 months before separation date at 9:00 AM
Subject Line: 365 days to separation: Here's your roadmap
Preview Text: The biggest mistakes happen in month 12. Avoid them...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

One year out. This is where your transition really begins.

Most veterans wait until month 6 to start planning. By then, they've already missed critical windows—VA claim prep, skill certifications, networking opportunities.

You're not going to make that mistake.

**Here's your 12-month mission:**

**Months 12-9:** Foundation building
- VA claim evidence gathering
- Resume first draft
- Career field research
- Skill assessment

**Months 9-6:** Skill development
- Certifications and training
- LinkedIn optimization
- Initial networking
- Interview preparation

**Months 6-3:** Active execution
- Job applications (20+ per month)
- VA claim submission
- Active interviewing
- Offer negotiations

**Months 3-0:** Final sprint
- Terminal leave planning
- Healthcare transition
- Final paperwork
- Start date coordination

**Your month 12 priorities:**

1. Document your military achievements (you'll forget details later)
2. Start gathering VA claim evidence (medical records, buddy letters)
3. Research career fields that match your skills
4. Update your LinkedIn with a professional photo

That's it. Four things. Not twenty. Just four.

You've got 365 days. Use them wisely.

EMAIL 2: Month 11—Get Your VA Claim Started NOW
Send: 11 months before separation at 10:00 AM
Subject Line: Why starting your VA claim now saves you $10K+
Preview Text: Evidence you gather today determines your rating...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You can't file your VA claim until you're 180 days out (month 6).

But if you wait until month 6 to start preparing? You've already lost.

Here's why:

**Evidence takes time to gather.** Medical records from 5 years ago. Buddy letters from people who've already separated. Documentation of incidents that happened years back.

You can't manufacture this stuff in month 6 when you're scrambling.

**What to do in month 11:**

**1. List every injury, illness, or condition**
Don't self-filter. If something hurts or bothers you, write it down.
- Physical: Knee, back, shoulder, hearing, sleep issues
- Mental: Anxiety, depression, PTSD, adjustment problems

**2. Connect each condition to service**
When did it start? What caused it? Who witnessed it? Where were you stationed?

**3. Gather current evidence**
- Schedule medical appointments NOW for anything that bothers you
- Get it documented in your medical records while you're still in
- Ask your doc to note the severity and impact on your daily life

**4. Identify buddy letter sources**
Who served with you when you got injured? Get their contact info before they PCS or separate.

**The money difference:**

Starting now vs. waiting until month 6 could mean the difference between a 30% rating and a 70% rating.

That's $1,529/month vs. $466/month.
Over 30 years: $382,680 vs. $167,760.
**Difference: $214,920.**

Worth starting early? You decide.

EMAIL 3: Month 10—Resume Building Begins
Send: 10 months before separation at 11:00 AM
Subject Line: Your first resume draft is due (to yourself)
Preview Text: Bad resume = no interviews. Let's get this right...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Month 10 goal: Complete your first resume draft.

Not your final version. Not a polished masterpiece. Just a solid first draft that you can refine over the next several months.

**Why start now?**

Because resume writing takes longer than you think. You'll go through 5-7 drafts before you have something that actually works.

Draft 1: Military language (sounds like your eval)
Draft 2: Civilian translation (but still awkward)
Draft 3: Better, but missing impact
Draft 4: Added numbers, still too long
Draft 5: Condensed, but lost important details
Draft 6: Finding the balance
Draft 7: Actually pretty good

That process takes months. Start now.

**Your month 10 resume mission:**

**1. Choose a format**
- Reverse chronological (most common)
- One page if <10 years experience
- Two pages if 10+ years

**2. Write your basic sections**
- Contact info
- Professional summary (2-3 sentences)
- Work experience (translate your positions)
- Education and training
- Skills (technical + soft skills)

**3. Use our translation helper**
Don't write "Infantry Team Leader." Write "Operations Team Leader managing 9-person unit in high-risk environments."

**4. Get it down on paper**
Don't obsess over perfection. Just get the bones in place.

You'll refine this over the next 10 months. But you can't refine what doesn't exist.

EMAIL 4: Month 9—LinkedIn and Networking Ramp-Up
Send: 9 months before separation at 9:30 AM
Subject Line: LinkedIn is where 87% of recruiters find candidates
Preview Text: If your profile says "Sergeant," you're invisible...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Recruiters aren't checking USAJobs. They're checking LinkedIn.

87% of recruiters use LinkedIn as their primary candidate source. If your profile is weak (or nonexistent), you don't exist to them.

**What's wrong with most veteran LinkedIn profiles:**

❌ Headline: "Staff Sergeant, US Marine Corps"
(Recruiters don't search for "Staff Sergeant." They search for "Project Manager" or "Logistics Coordinator.")

❌ Summary: "Transitioning military veteran seeking opportunities."
(Translation: "Please hire me because I have no idea what I want.")

❌ Experience: Lists positions by rank and unit
(Nobody knows what "S-4 NCOIC, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines" means.)

**What good profiles look like:**

✓ Headline: "Operations Manager | Supply Chain | Team Leadership | Security Clearance"
(Searchable keywords recruiters actually use.)

✓ Summary: "Operations professional with 7 years managing logistics in complex, high-pressure environments. Proven track record of reducing costs, improving efficiency, and leading diverse teams through change."
(Tells them what you do, not what rank you were.)

✓ Experience: Civilian-translated job titles with quantified achievements
(Shows impact in language they understand.)

**Your month 9 mission:**

1. Update your profile with civilian language
2. Add a professional headshot (not your dress uniform photo)
3. Connect with 50+ people in your target industry
4. Join 5-10 groups related to your career field

LinkedIn isn't optional. It's your digital resume.

EMAIL 5: Month 8—Certification Planning and Execution
Send: 8 months before separation at 1:00 PM
Subject Line: The right cert could add $15K to your salary
Preview Text: Which certifications actually matter in 2025...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Not all certifications are created equal.

Some open doors and add serious money to your salary. Others are resume fluff that nobody cares about.

**High-value certifications by field:**

**IT/Cybersecurity:**
- CompTIA Security+ (entry level, widely recognized)
- CISSP (senior level, big salary bump)
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect (cloud is huge)

**Project Management:**
- PMP (gold standard, adds $10K-$20K to salary)
- Scrum Master (agile is everywhere now)
- Six Sigma (manufacturing, process improvement)

**Healthcare:**
- EMT/Paramedic (direct transition from military medical)
- Nursing certs (if you've got medical background)

**Skilled Trades:**
- Electrical, HVAC, Welding (high demand, great pay)

**Logistics/Supply Chain:**
- CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional)
- APICS certifications

**Your month 8 mission:**

1. Research which certs matter in your target field
2. Check if SkillBridge can fund it (free training during terminal leave)
3. Register for the exam
4. Start studying NOW (most certs need 60-90 days of prep)

**The ROI:**

PMP certification costs $555.
Average salary increase: $16,000/year.
First-year ROI: 2,783%.

That's not a typo.

Jacob

P.S. Use your GI Bill or SkillBridge before paying out of pocket. Free is better.

EMAIL 6: Month 7—TAP and Transition Assistance Programs
Send: 7 months before separation at 10:00 AM
Subject Line: TAP class is mandatory but insufficient
Preview Text: What TAP covers (and what it doesn't)...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You'll take TAP (Transition Assistance Program) sometime in the next few months.

It's mandatory. It's also the bare minimum.

**What TAP actually covers:**

- Resume basics (very high level)
- VA benefits overview (surface level)
- Interview tips (generic advice)
- Financial planning (one-size-fits-all)

**What TAP doesn't cover:**

- Industry-specific job searching strategies
- Advanced VA claims tactics (secondary conditions, evidence gathering)
- Salary negotiation specifics
- Real-world networking
- What to actually do day 1 after separation

TAP gives you the 101-level overview. You need the 401-level execution.

**Make TAP worth your time:**

1. **Take notes on the basics** (they do cover important stuff)
2. **Network with other attendees** (they're going through the same thing)
3. **Ask specific questions** (instructors have good insights if you ask)
4. **Identify gaps in your knowledge** (what wasn't covered that you need?)

**After TAP, fill the gaps:**

- Deep dive on VA claims strategy
- Industry-specific resume optimization
- Real interview practice (not generic tips)
- Actual networking outreach
- Company research for target employers

TAP is your foundation. But you need to build the house yourself.

EMAIL 7: Month 6—Job Search Goes Live
Send: 6 months before separation at 9:00 AM
Subject Line: Time to start applying (here's your strategy)
Preview Text: 20 applications per month minimum. Here's how...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Month 6 is when your job search shifts from prep to execution.

You've built your resume. You've optimized LinkedIn. You've done your research.

Now it's time to actually apply.

**Your job search strategy for months 6-0:**

**Target: 20 applications per month minimum**
(That's 1 per business day. Totally manageable.)

**Quality over spray-and-pray:**
Don't apply to 100 random jobs. Apply to 20 jobs you actually want and customize each application.

**Track everything:**
- Company name
- Position title
- Date applied
- Contact person (if you have one)
- Follow-up dates
- Status (applied, phone screen, interview, offer, rejected)

**The application process that works:**

1. Find a job posting that matches your skills
2. Research the company (15 minutes)
3. Customize your resume for that specific role (10 minutes)
4. Write a brief, targeted cover letter (10 minutes)
5. Apply through their system AND email the hiring manager directly if you can find them
6. Log it in your job tracker
7. Set a reminder to follow up in 1 week

**Timeline expectations:**

- Week 1-2: Mostly silence (this is normal)
- Week 2-4: Phone screens start
- Week 4-8: In-person interviews
- Week 8-12: Offers (hopefully)

6 months is enough time. But only if you start now and stay consistent.

EMAIL 8: Month 5—Final VA Claim Push
Send: 5 months before separation at 11:00 AM
Subject Line: VA claim submission window opens next month
Preview Text: Final evidence review before you file...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Next month (month 4), you can officially file your VA claim.

But this month is your final prep. Last chance to gather evidence before you submit.

**Final evidence review checklist:**

**1. Medical documentation**
□ All service medical records requested
□ Current medical appointments completed
□ Civilian medical records (if any) gathered
□ Nexus letters from doctors (if needed)

**2. Lay evidence**
□ Buddy letters written and signed
□ Personal statements drafted
□ Spouse/family statements (if relevant)
□ Photos/videos of your condition (if applicable)

**3. Service connection proof**
□ Incident reports
□ Unit logs or records
□ Deployment documentation
□ Any paperwork showing injury/illness during service

**4. Conditions list finalized**
□ All primary conditions listed
□ All secondary conditions identified
□ Ratings research complete (what percentage is each worth?)

**5. DBQ consideration**
□ Disability Benefits Questionnaires (if your doc will fill them out)
□ These aren't required but can be powerful evidence

**The more evidence you submit upfront, the faster and higher your rating.**

Submitting a claim with minimal evidence and hoping the VA finds it? That's a recipe for delay and denial.

Submitting a claim with overwhelming documentation? That's a recipe for approval.

Do the work now.

EMAIL 9: Month 4—Interview Season Begins
Send: 4 months before separation at 2:00 PM
Subject Line: Your first interview is coming. Are you ready?
Preview Text: Interview prep checklist for transitioning veterans...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

If you've been applying consistently, you should start getting interview requests right about now.

First one is always nerve-wracking. That's normal.

**What civilian interviews actually test:**

**1. Can you do the job?** (Skills and experience)
**2. Will you fit the culture?** (Personality and communication)
**3. Do you actually want this job?** (Enthusiasm and research)

You're probably fine on #1. Most veterans are overqualified.

You might struggle with #2 and #3. That's where veterans usually trip up.

**Common veteran interview mistakes:**

❌ Too formal (you don't need to say "sir" or "ma'am")
❌ Too brief (they want stories, not yes/no answers)
❌ Too military (translate your language)
❌ Not enthusiastic enough (they want to see you actually want the job)
❌ No questions prepared (shows lack of interest)

**How to prepare for each interview:**

**The night before:**
- Research the company (30 minutes)
- Review the job description
- Prepare 3-5 stories that demonstrate your skills
- Prepare 5+ questions to ask them
- Review your resume (know what you wrote)

**The morning of:**
- Dress appropriately (when in doubt, business casual)
- Arrive 10 minutes early
- Bring copies of your resume
- Silence your phone

**During the interview:**
- Make eye contact
- Smile (seriously, you'd be surprised)
- Answer in STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Show genuine interest

You've briefed commanders. You can handle a hiring manager.

EMAIL 10: Month 3—Terminal Leave and Final Planning
Send: 3 months before separation at 10:00 AM
Subject Line: Terminal leave math: Get this wrong and lose money
Preview Text: How to maximize your terminal leave benefits...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Terminal leave planning isn't just about taking vacation before you're out.

It's about maximizing your financial bridge between military pay and civilian pay.

**Terminal leave math:**

Let's say you have 60 days of leave saved up (pretty common).

**Option 1: Sell it back**
60 days × your base pay = ~$8,000 (varies by rank)
But it's taxed heavily (you'll see ~$5,500)

**Option 2: Take terminal leave**
60 days of full pay and benefits (including BAH)
= ~$12,000 total (varies by rank and location)
Plus you keep Tricare for those 60 days

**Option 3: Split it**
Take 30 days terminal, sell back 30 days
Middle ground approach

**The smart play:**

If you have a job starting right after separation: Take full terminal leave. Use those 60 days to start your civilian job while still getting military pay and benefits.

If you don't have a job yet: Still take terminal leave. Use it to interview and job search while still getting paid.

**Your month 3 mission:**

1. Calculate your exact leave balance
2. Decide your terminal leave start date
3. Work backwards from your separation date
4. Coordinate with your new employer (if applicable)
5. Submit your terminal leave request

**Example timeline:**

Separation date: June 1
Terminal leave: 60 days
Terminal leave starts: April 1
Civilian job starts: April 15

You're making military pay through June 1, but working civilian job starting April 15. That's overlap income.

Plan it right.

EMAIL 11: Month 2—Final Preparations and Healthcare
Send: 2 months before separation at 1:00 PM
Subject Line: 60 days out: Final checklist activation
Preview Text: Healthcare, housing, finances—lock it all down now...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Two months out. This is where you handle all the non-career stuff that still matters.

**Healthcare transition:**

**1. Choose your post-military healthcare**
□ VA healthcare enrollment (if eligible)
□ Employer insurance (review plans, choose coverage)
□ Marketplace/ACA (if no employer coverage)
□ COBRA (bridge option if needed)

**2. Final military medical tasks**
□ Complete any outstanding appointments
□ Get final physical and dental
□ Request complete medical records
□ Fill prescriptions for 90-day supply

**Housing decisions:**

**Staying local?**
□ Housing search complete
□ Lease signed or mortgage approved
□ Moving plans finalized

**Relocating?**
□ Housing search in new location
□ Moving company booked
□ Address change plan ready

**Financial prep:**

□ Budget adjusted for civilian income/expenses
□ Emergency fund check (aim for 3-6 months expenses)
□ Direct deposit updated for new job
□ Understand your final military pay (when it hits, what's included)
□ TSP rollover decision (leave it, roll to IRA, or cash out)

**Administrative tasks:**

□ Update DEERS if family situation changed
□ File VA claim if you haven't already
□ Request DD-214 (check it when you get it)
□ Start clearing process

This is the paperwork phase. Not fun, but critical.

Don't skip it.

EMAIL 12: Month 1—You're Almost There
Send: 1 month before separation at 9:00 AM
Subject Line: 30 days left. Here's what matters now.
Preview Text: Final tasks before you clear that final gate...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

One month left.

You're in the final sprint now. Everything you've built over the last 11 months comes down to execution in these last 30 days.

**Final 30-day priorities:**

**Week 1 (Days 1-7):**
□ Complete all clearing appointments
□ Pick up your DD-214 (check it immediately)
□ Finalize terminal leave dates
□ Confirm civilian job start date
□ Healthcare coverage confirmed

**Week 2 (Days 8-14):**
□ Return all gear
□ Clean out workspace
□ Update contact info everywhere
□ File change of address
□ Final financial prep

**Week 3 (Days 15-21):**
□ Say goodbyes to key people
□ Take photos of your unit/base
□ Last military medical appointments
□ Final paperwork signed

**Week 4 (Days 22-30):**
□ Terminal leave begins
□ Breathe
□ Prepare for civilian job (if starting soon)
□ Decompress

**A few final thoughts:**

You've spent months preparing for this. You've built your resume. You've filed your VA claim. You've networked and interviewed. You've planned and prepared.

Now trust the work you've done.

**Transition isn't a single moment—it's a process.** You won't have everything figured out on day one. That's okay. No one does.

You're going to stumble sometimes. You're going to miss the military sometimes. You're going to wonder if you made the right choice.

That's all normal.

But you're also going to succeed. Because you've got the skills, the preparation, and the resilience to figure it out.

**Post-separation support:**

I'll still be here after you separate. You'll get occasional check-in emails. You can access all the tools anytime. Hit reply if you need anything.

You've got this.

See you on the other side.

Jacob

P.S. When you land that job or get your VA rating, let me know. I want to hear how it turned out.
