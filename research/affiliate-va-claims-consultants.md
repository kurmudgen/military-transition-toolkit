## ⚠️ IMPORTANT LEGAL & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Regulatory Landscape (2024 Update)

**VA Position on Non-Accredited Consultants:**
- The VA contends that many consulting companies not accredited with the VA amounts to "illegal exploitation and profiteering"
- Anyone who prepares benefits claims without proper authorization is breaking the law
- The VA accredits three types of representatives:
  1. Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) representatives
  2. Attorneys
  3. Claims agents

**Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Warning:**
- Many companies call themselves "coaches" or "consultants" and advertise their ability to assist with VA benefits claims but may not be accredited to practice before the VA
- Hundreds of websites advertise help for veterans seeking disability benefits

**Legislative Scrutiny (2024):**
- Lawmakers are examining whether consultants for veteran benefits should see big profits
- Increased regulatory attention on this industry

### Ethical Recommendations for Military Transition Toolkit

✅ **ACCEPTABLE:**
- Partnering with VA-accredited attorneys
- Partnering with accredited claims agents
- Referring to accredited VSOs (if they have referral programs)

❌ **AVOID:**
- Partnering with non-accredited "coaches" or "consultants" who charge for claims preparation
- Making guarantees about disability rating increases
- Hiding the accreditation status of partners
- Recommending questionable services for commission alone

⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION:**
- Pre-filing consultants (legal gray area)

## AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
