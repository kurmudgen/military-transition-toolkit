# Veteran Transition Content Gap Analysis & Roadmap

**Date:** November 17, 2025
**Purpose:** Identify content opportunities to better serve transitioning veterans and their families

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research across veteran forums, government resources, and industry sources, we've identified significant content gaps in veteran transition support. **48% of veterans don't understand their benefit options**, and **27% struggle with civilian readjustment**. This roadmap prioritizes 50+ high-opportunity content pieces that address these critical gaps.

### Key Findings:
- **Veteran unemployment (18-24):** 12.3% vs lower rates for civilian peers
- **Understanding gap:** 48% don't understand disability benefit options
- **Underemployment:** 60%+ of veterans are underemployed
- **Difficult transition:** Nearly 50% describe transition as "difficult" or "very difficult"
- **Job search primary challenge:** Finding employment is #1 obstacle

---

## Major Content Gaps Identified

### 1. **VA Benefits Understanding** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Gap:** Veterans miss out on state-specific benefits, temporary disability ratings, housing adaptations
- **Search volume:** High (veterans actively searching but getting generic VA.gov content)
- **Content quality:** Mostly government websites with dense legal language
- **Opportunity:** Create plain-language guides with real examples

### 2. **Military-to-Civilian Skills Translation** (CRITICAL)
- **Gap:** Veterans struggle to translate MOS/AFSC to civilian job titles
- **Pain point:** Resume writing is a top barrier to employment
- **Search volume:** Very high ("how to write veteran resume" + variations)
- **Content quality:** Generic templates without MOS-specific examples
- **Opportunity:** MOS-specific translation guides with real resume examples

### 3. **TSP & Financial Planning** (UNDERSERVED)
- **Gap:** Confusion about TSP rollover decisions at separation
- **Pain point:** Financial advisors often push expensive products
- **Search volume:** Medium-high (every transitioning service member faces this)
- **Content quality:** Either too technical or sales-focused
- **Opportunity:** Unbiased decision frameworks and calculators

### 4. **VA Home Loan Misconceptions** (HIGH DEMAND)
- **Gap:** "One-time use myth" prevents repeat usage
- **Pain point:** Losing bids in competitive markets, COE confusion
- **Search volume:** Very high (major life purchase)
- **Content quality:** Lender marketing materials, not educational
- **Opportunity:** Myth-busting guides, competitive offer strategies

### 5. **Military Spouse Employment** (NEGLECTED AUDIENCE)
- **Gap:** Spouses rarely included in transition planning
- **Pain point:** Portable careers needed due to frequent moves
- **Search volume:** Medium but passionate niche
- **Content quality:** Limited resources compared to veteran content
- **Opportunity:** First-mover advantage in dedicated spouse content

### 6. **Licensing & Certification Translation** (TECHNICAL GAP)
- **Gap:** Veterans don't know COOL program exists or how to use it
- **Pain point:** Starting over despite military training/certifications
- **Search volume:** Medium (specific to technical MOSs)
- **Content quality:** Government sites only, no practical guides
- **Opportunity:** Step-by-step COOL navigation by MOS

### 7. **LinkedIn & Professional Networking** (SKILL GAP)
- **Gap:** Veterans underutilize LinkedIn, don't know about free Premium
- **Pain point:** 85% of jobs filled through networking, but veterans lack civilian networks
- **Search volume:** High ("LinkedIn tips for veterans")
- **Content quality:** Generic LinkedIn advice, not veteran-specific
- **Opportunity:** Veteran-specific LinkedIn optimization with before/after examples

### 8. **VA Disability Appeals Process** (HIGH ANXIETY)
- **Gap:** Confusing 3-option system (HLR, Supplemental, BVA)
- **Pain point:** Fear of losing benefits, missing deadlines
- **Search volume:** Very high (affects 40% who appeal)
- **Content quality:** Legal jargon, lawyer marketing
- **Opportunity:** Plain-language decision trees and timelines

### 9. **Remote Work for Veterans** (EMERGING TREND)
- **Gap:** Veterans don't know which skills translate to remote work
- **Pain point:** Geographic limitations, disabilities, caregiving needs
- **Search volume:** Rapidly growing (post-COVID shift)
- **Content quality:** General remote work advice, not veteran-focused
- **Opportunity:** First comprehensive veteran remote work guide

### 10. **Apprenticeships & Skilled Trades** (ALTERNATIVE PATH)
- **Gap:** GI Bill for apprenticeships is unknown
- **Pain point:** "College-only" assumption ignores skilled trades
- **Search volume:** Medium but growing (trade worker shortage)
- **Content quality:** Scattered across union websites
- **Opportunity:** Comprehensive trades guide with salary data

### 11. **Veteran Entrepreneurship** (HIGH INTEREST)
- **Gap:** Boots to Business attendance is low, VBOC underutilized
- **Pain point:** Access to capital, federal contracting complexity
- **Search volume:** High ("veteran business grants", "veteran startup")
- **Content quality:** Government program descriptions, not how-to guides
- **Opportunity:** Step-by-step startup playbook for veterans

### 12. **GI Bill Optimization** (BENEFIT MAXIMIZATION)
- **Gap:** Running out of benefits, not knowing about VR&E alternative
- **Pain point:** 36-month limit, school selection mistakes
- **Search volume:** Very high (every veteran using education benefits)
- **Content quality:** Eligibility rules, not strategic usage advice
- **Opportunity:** GI Bill strategy guides by career path
