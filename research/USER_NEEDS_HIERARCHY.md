**Research Date:** November 2025
**Framework:** Modified Maslow's Hierarchy for Transitioning Veterans

## HIERARCHY OVERVIEW

This hierarchy organizes veteran needs from most fundamental (survival) to highest-level (self-actualization). Lower-level needs must be addressed before higher-level needs become priorities.

## URGENT vs IMPORTANT MATRIX

### URGENT + IMPORTANT (Do First)

### IMPORTANT, NOT URGENT (Schedule)
- Level 3: Identity work, community building
- Level 4: Education planning, skill development

### URGENT, NOT IMPORTANT (Delegate/Minimize)
- Administrative tasks that can be streamlined
- Paperwork that could be automated

### NOT URGENT, NOT IMPORTANT (Eliminate)
- Unnecessary bureaucracy
- Redundant processes

---

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR PRODUCT DESIGN

### 1. Address Lower Levels First
If a veteran doesn't have income (Level 1), they won't engage with career development features (Level 4).

### 2. Multiple Levels Active Simultaneously
Veterans may need Level 1 support (healthcare) while also working on Level 3 (identity).

### 3. Regression Happens
Job loss can drop a veteran from Level 4 back to Level 1. System must handle regression.

### 4. Spouse Needs Parallel Veteran Needs
Military spouses have their own hierarchy running concurrently.

### 5. Time-Sensitive Needs
- Level 1 needs are IMMEDIATE (days/weeks)
- Level 5 needs emerge over years

### 6. Interdependencies
- Can't build identity (L3) without stability (L2)
- Can't pursue growth (L4) without security (L2)
- Can't find purpose (L5) without belonging (L3)

## UNMET NEEDS ANALYSIS

### Currently Underserved

**Level 1:**
- ✗ Income gap between military and civilian employment
- ✗ Healthcare access for those 60+ miles from VA
- ✗ Emergency financial support during transition

**Level 2:**
- ✗ Skills translation support (70% struggle)
- ✗ Benefits navigation (85% unprepared by TAP)
- ✗ Spouse employment during relocation

**Level 3:**
- ✗ Identity transition support
- ✗ Civilian community integration
- ✗ Family counseling and reconnection

**Level 4:**
- ✗ Career advancement pathways
- ✗ Portable spouse careers
- ✗ Skills gap training

**Level 5:**
- ✗ Meaningful work matching
- ✗ Veteran-to-veteran mentoring platforms
- ✗ Service opportunity connections

---

## CONCLUSION

Veteran needs form a clear hierarchy from survival to self-actualization. The current system fails primarily at:

1. **Level 1-2 (Foundation):** 85% unprepared, 70% struggle with employment
2. **Level 2 (Stability):** Benefits navigation overwhelming, employment barriers
3. **Level 3 (Belonging):** Identity crisis, isolation (27-44% struggle)

**Product Implication:** Focus on Levels 1-3 first. Without addressing basic survival, stability, and belonging needs, higher-level features will have minimal adoption and impact.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Address immediate income/employment needs (Level 1-2)
- Simplify benefits navigation (Level 2)
- Provide community and identity support (Level 3)
- Design for regression (job loss can drop veterans back to Level 1)
- Include spouse needs throughout hierarchy
