[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

What if I told you that you could go from Navy IT making forty-five thousand dollars a year to a cybersecurity engineer making over one hundred thousand - in less than two years? [pause] That's exactly what Marcus did. And today, he's going to tell you how.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today I'm doing something different. We're telling a success story. This is Marcus, a former Navy Information Systems Technician who transitioned into cybersecurity. This isn't a celebrity story or some overnight success. This is a real guy, normal background, who made smart moves and built a great civilian career.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

Today you're going to hear exactly how Marcus made the transition - the certifications he got, the mistakes he made, the timeline from start to finish, and his specific advice for Navy IT folks and anyone else looking to get into tech. This is a roadmap you can follow. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 24-26 minutes]

**Segment 1: Marcus's Background and Decision to Transition (4 minutes)**

**Jacob:** Alright Marcus, let's start at the beginning. Give us your background. How long were you in the Navy, what did you do, and when did you start thinking about getting out?

**Marcus:** Yeah, so I was in the Navy for eight years. I came in at 18, I was an Information Systems Technician - that's IT rating - and I did two sea tours and one shore duty. I was an E5, IT2, when I got out in 2022.

As far as my job, I was doing network administration, help desk support, troubleshooting systems, maintaining communications equipment. Pretty standard IT stuff for the Navy. On my ship we had about 400 people and I was part of a four-person IT team managing all the networks and systems.

**Jacob:** So when did you start thinking, "okay, I need to plan my exit from the Navy"?

**Marcus:** Honestly, around the six-year mark. I was coming up on my second reenlistment and I was looking at the math. I was an E5 making about $45,000 a year total with BAH and everything. And I had buddies who had gotten out two or three years prior who were making double that in civilian IT jobs.

At the same time, I was enjoying the work - I liked the technical side - but I was frustrated with the military bureaucracy. You know how it is. You spend half your time doing Navy stuff that has nothing to do with your actual job. Duty days, uniform inspections, all that. I wanted to just focus on the technical work.

So I decided I wasn't going to reenlist. I had about two years left on my contract at that point. That's when I started planning the transition.

**Jacob:** Two years out - that's actually the perfect timeline. What did you know about civilian IT at that point?

**Marcus:** Not much, honestly. I knew there were jobs out there, but I didn't know what they paid, what certifications mattered, how to position my military experience. I didn't know anyone in my family who worked in tech. So I had to figure it all out.

I started by just googling "Navy IT civilian jobs" and reading everything I could find. I joined veteran LinkedIn groups. I reached out to people who had made the transition before me. And that's where I started hearing about cybersecurity as a career path.

**Jacob:** What specifically about cybersecurity caught your attention?

**Marcus:** Two things. One, the pay. I was seeing job postings for cybersecurity analysts and engineers making $80K to $100K, sometimes more. Way more than general IT support roles.

Two, it seemed like a natural progression from what I was already doing. In the Navy, especially on ships, information assurance and cybersecurity is a big part of the IT rating's job. We were managing firewalls, doing security audits, implementing security protocols. I had that background already.

So I thought, if I can get a couple cybersecurity certifications and position myself correctly, I can probably make that jump.

**Segment 2: The Certification Path (6 minutes)**

**Jacob:** So walk us through your certification strategy. What certs did you get and when?

**Marcus:** Okay, so this is where I made both good decisions and some mistakes. Let me tell you what I did and what I would do differently.

About 18 months before I got out, I got my CompTIA Security+. That's Security Plus, S-E-C-U-R-I-T-Y plus. That's kind of the baseline certification for cybersecurity. It covers network security, compliance, operational security, threats and vulnerabilities - all the foundational stuff.

I studied for about three months using Professor Messer's free videos on YouTube and Jason Dion's practice exams on Udemy. Total cost was about $400 - that's $370 for the exam and $30 for the practice tests. I used my GI Bill to cover it.

Passed it on the first try. That was a big confidence boost.

**Jacob:** Security+ is one that keeps coming up when I talk to people in cybersecurity. Why is it so important?

**Marcus:** Two reasons. First, it's a requirement for a lot of DOD contractor jobs. If you want to work on DOD networks in any cybersecurity capacity, you need Security+ or an equivalent cert. It's mandated by DOD 8570, which is the directive that sets the requirements for information assurance personnel.

Second, it's vendor-neutral. It's not tied to a specific company's products. So employers see it as a solid foundational certification that proves you understand security concepts, not just one company's tools.

**Jacob:** Alright, so you got Security+ about 18 months out. What was next?

**Marcus:** So this is where I made a mistake. I spent the next six months not doing anything else. I kind of thought, "okay, I got my cert, I'm good." That was wrong.

What I should have done was immediately start studying for my next certification. Because here's the reality - Security+ gets you in the door, but it's not enough by itself to get you into higher-paying roles.

About six months before I got out, I realized this and I started pursuing my next cert, which was CompTIA CySA+. That's C-Y-S-A-plus, Cybersecurity Analyst.

CySA+ is a step up from Security+. It covers threat detection, data analysis, and incident response. It's more hands-on and it shows that you can actually work as a security analyst, not just understand the concepts.

I studied for about four months for this one. It's harder than Security+. But I passed it about two months before I got out.

**Jacob:** So you separated from the Navy with Security+ and CySA+. What happened next with certifications?

**Marcus:** So I got my first civilian job - we'll talk about that job search in a minute - and I was working as a junior cybersecurity analyst making about $68,000. That was in 2022.

Once I was working, I realized I needed to keep building my credentials. About six months into that job, I started studying for my CISSP. That's C-I-S-S-P, Certified Information Systems Security Professional.

CISSP is the big one in cybersecurity. It's the gold standard. It's a management-level certification that covers eight domains of security. It's expensive - the exam is $749 - and it's hard. But it's worth it.

One thing about CISSP though - you need five years of work experience in information security to be fully certified. I didn't have that yet. But you can take the exam and become an Associate of ISC2 - that's I-S-C-squared - and then once you hit your five years of experience, you get the full CISSP.

I passed the CISSP exam about eight months after I started my first civilian job. And having that on my resume, even as an Associate, opened doors.

**Jacob:** What doors specifically?

**Marcus:** I started getting recruiter messages on LinkedIn almost immediately. Jobs I wasn't even applying to. Companies reaching out asking if I was interested in roles. And the salary ranges being discussed jumped from the $68K I was making to $85K to $100K.

That's when I started looking for my next position. And about four months later, I landed my current job as a cybersecurity engineer making $105,000.

**Jacob:** So total timeline from when you started pursuing certs to landing a six-figure job - what was that?

**Marcus:** About two and a half years. I started with Security+ about 18 months before I got out. So call it six months of studying and working in the Navy, then two years in civilian workforce. Two and a half years from start to finish to get to six figures.

**Jacob:** That's realistic and that's achievable. Let's talk about the job search process.

**Segment 3: The Job Search - What Worked and What Didn't (6 minutes)**

**Jacob:** So you're about six months out from separation. You've got Security+ and you're working on CySA+. When did you start applying to jobs?

**Marcus:** I started about four months out. And I applied to everything. That was another mistake.

I was just going on Indeed and LinkedIn and searching "cybersecurity" and applying to any job that came up. Entry-level, senior-level, didn't matter. I was throwing spaghetti at the wall.

I probably applied to 80 or 90 jobs in those first two months. Know how many responses I got? Three. Three interviews. And all three went nowhere.

**Jacob:** What was going wrong?

**Marcus:** Two things. One, I wasn't tailoring my resume to the jobs. I had one generic resume and I was sending it everywhere. Big mistake.

Two, I was applying to jobs I wasn't qualified for. Like, I'd see a job posting for a senior security engineer requiring five years of experience and specific cloud certifications, and I'd apply anyway thinking "eh, maybe they'll give me a shot." They didn't.

**Jacob:** So what changed?

**Marcus:** I connected with a veteran mentor through one of the LinkedIn groups I had joined. Guy named David, former Air Force, had transitioned into cybersecurity a few years earlier. He looked at my resume and my job search strategy and basically told me I was doing it all wrong.

He told me three things that changed everything.

First, focus on entry-level and junior roles. Stop wasting time on jobs you're not qualified for. Look for titles like "junior security analyst," "SOC analyst" - that's S-O-C, Security Operations Center - "information security analyst," things like that. And look for job postings that say "veterans encouraged to apply" or "military experience valued."

Second, tailor your resume for every job. Take the job description, pull out the key skills and requirements they list, and make sure your resume uses that same language. Applicant tracking systems - those are the robots that scan resumes - they're looking for keyword matches. If the job posting says "experience with SIEM tools" and your resume says "security monitoring," it won't match even though it's the same thing.

Third, leverage your clearance if you have one. I had a Secret clearance from the Navy. That's valuable, especially for DOD contractor work. A lot of civilian companies that work with the government need people with active clearances. That was a major advantage I wasn't emphasizing.

**Jacob:** So you made those changes. What happened?

**Marcus:** Within two weeks of updating my resume and focusing on appropriate jobs, I had four interviews scheduled. [pause] Four. After applying to like 15 jobs. Way better response rate.

And one of those interviews was with a DOD contractor that needed junior security analysts for a government project. They specifically wanted people with Security+ and an active clearance. I had both.

I went through three rounds of interviews. The first was with HR, just basic questions. The second was with the hiring manager, more technical questions about security concepts. The third was with the team I'd be working with, making sure I'd be a cultural fit.

I got the offer about two weeks after that third interview. $68,000 salary, full benefits, government contract work. That was my first civilian job.

**Jacob:** What was that transition like? First day on the civilian job after eight years in the Navy?

**Marcus:** [laughs] It was weird, man. First off, no one cares what time you show up as long as you get your work done. I'm so used to having to be at work at 7 a.m. for quarters. This job was like, "core hours are 9 to 3, be online then, otherwise work whenever."

Second thing - people treated me like an adult. In the Navy there's this whole thing where if one person screws up, everyone gets punished. Liberty gets secured, extra duty for everyone. In my civilian job, if someone misses a deadline, their manager talks to them individually. They don't punish the whole team. That was refreshing.

But there were challenges too. I had to get used to not having the military structure. No one's telling you exactly what to do and when to do it. You've got to be self-directed. You've got projects with deadlines and you figure out how to meet them.

Also, the technical side moved faster. In the military, systems and processes change slowly. In the private sector, new tools and technologies are being adopted constantly. I had to keep learning.

**Jacob:** Talk about the learning aspect. You're in your first civilian job, what are you doing to keep growing?

**Marcus:** That's when I started on the CISSP like I mentioned. But beyond certifications, I was learning on the job. I was working with tools I'd never used in the Navy - specific SIEM platforms, vulnerability scanners, penetration testing tools.

I was also asking questions. A lot of questions. My team lead told me early on, "You're going to have a learning curve, that's fine, just ask when you don't know something." So I did.

And I was staying late sometimes - not because I had to, but because I was genuinely interested in learning this stuff. I'd be working on a task and I'd want to understand it deeper, so I'd spend extra time on it.

**Segment 4: Landing the Six-Figure Job (4-5 minutes)**

**Jacob:** So you're about a year into your first job. You pass your CISSP exam. Recruiters start reaching out. Walk us through how you landed your current role.

**Marcus:** Yeah, so I started getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn. Most of them were garbage, honestly - people who clearly just mass-messaged anyone with "cybersecurity" in their profile.

But a few were legitimate. There was one recruiter from a tech consulting firm that was looking for a cybersecurity engineer for one of their clients. The role was more engineering-focused - building security solutions, not just monitoring alerts.

The salary range they mentioned in the initial message was $95K to $110K. That got my attention because I was making $68K.

I responded and we had a phone screening. They asked about my experience, my certifications, what I was looking for in my next role. I told them I wanted to move from monitoring and analysis into more of an engineering and implementation role. They said this could be a fit.

They sent me the full job description. It was legit. They wanted someone with Security+ or CISSP, experience with firewalls and network security, ability to design and implement security solutions. I had most of that.

I applied and they moved me forward to interviews.

**Jacob:** How did you prepare for those interviews?

**Marcus:** I did three things. One, I researched the company and the client they were hiring for. I looked up news about the company, read their website, understood what they do. In the interview I could talk intelligently about their business.

Two, I prepared specific examples of my work. I knew they'd ask behavioral questions - "tell me about a time you solved a complex problem" or "tell me about a time you worked with a difficult team member." I had three or four examples from both my military time and my civilian job ready to go.

Three, I prepared questions to ask them. At the end of every interview, they ask "do you have any questions for us?" You better have questions. I asked about the team structure, about what technologies they're using, about what a typical project looks like, about opportunities for professional development.

**Jacob:** And the offer?

**Marcus:** They offered me $105,000, full benefits, and a $5,000 signing bonus. I negotiated them up to $107,000 and they agreed.

**Jacob:** Wait, you negotiated? Tell me about that because a lot of veterans don't negotiate their first offers.

**Marcus:** Yeah, and that's leaving money on the table. I almost didn't negotiate either. I was just so happy to get a six-figure offer. But my wife told me, "You need to at least try."

So I responded and said, "I'm excited about this opportunity. Based on my CISSP certification and my experience, I was hoping we could discuss a salary of $110,000."

They came back and said they could do $107,000. I accepted. That simple conversation got me an extra two thousand dollars per year. That's $2,000 more every year for the rest of my time at this company, plus it raises my baseline for every future job.

Always negotiate.

**Jacob:** That's huge. Alright, let's talk about where you are now and your advice for people trying to make this transition.

**Segment 5: Current Role and Lessons Learned (5-6 minutes)**

**Jacob:** So you're about two years into your civilian career now, making $107K as a cybersecurity engineer. What does your day-to-day look like?

**Marcus:** I'm working on a team of six cybersecurity professionals supporting a large healthcare organization. My job is to design and implement security solutions - things like setting up multi-factor authentication, configuring security tools, hardening systems against threats, doing security assessments of new technologies they want to adopt.

It's a mix of technical work and project management. I might spend the morning reviewing logs from our security tools, then the afternoon in a meeting with stakeholders about a new system we're implementing, then the evening configuring firewall rules.

It's challenging but it's interesting. Every day is a little different.

**Jacob:** What do you wish you had known when you were first starting this transition?

**Marcus:** Man, a lot of things. [pause]

First, I wish I had started networking earlier. I waited until like six months before I got out to start connecting with people on LinkedIn and joining veteran groups. I should have started that a year or more before. The relationships you build, the advice you get, the opportunities you hear about - that stuff takes time to develop.

Second, I wish I had been more strategic with my certifications from the beginning. I got Security+ and then waited six months before pursuing the next one. I should have had a plan: Security+ first, CySA+ six months later, CISSP a year after that. Having that roadmap would have kept me moving forward.

Third, I wish I had known to tailor my resume for every job. I wasted so much time applying to jobs with a generic resume that wasn't optimized for ATS systems.

Fourth - and this is big - I wish I had known my worth. When I got that first job offer at $68K, I just accepted it. I didn't negotiate. I didn't even research if that was a fair salary. I was just happy to have an offer. Looking back, I probably could have gotten $72K or $75K if I had negotiated. That's $4,000 to $7,000 I left on the table.

**Jacob:** What advice would you give specifically to Navy ITs who are looking to make the same move you did?

**Marcus:** First, you already have a huge advantage. Navy IT training is solid. You've got hands-on experience with networks, systems, troubleshooting. That's valuable. Don't undersell it.

Second, get your Security+ before you get out. Ideally 12 to 18 months before. This gives you time to pass it without the stress of job searching, and it opens doors immediately.

Third, if you have a clearance, maintain it. Don't let it lapse. Having an active clearance is worth tens of thousands of dollars in earning potential for DOD contractor work.

Fourth, start building your LinkedIn profile now. Professional headshot, detailed work history, skills section filled out, connections with people in the industry. LinkedIn is where the opportunities come from.

Fifth, use SkillBridge if you can. SkillBridge lets you work a civilian job during your last 180 days while still getting military pay. I didn't do this and I regret it. If I could go back, I would have done a SkillBridge internship at a cybersecurity company. That's six months of experience and networking before you even separate.

Sixth, don't be afraid to start at a junior level. I know some guys who get out and they think because they were an IT1 or ITC in the Navy, they should be getting senior-level civilian jobs. That's not how it works. You're going to start at a junior level in most cases. That's okay. You move up fast if you're competent and you keep learning.

**Jacob:** Last question. If someone's listening to this and they're an E4 or E5 IT with two years left on their contract, what should they do today?

**Marcus:** Today? Three things.

One, start studying for Security+. Go to Professor Messer's website, start watching the videos, commit to 30 minutes a day.

Two, go to LinkedIn and update your profile. Add your current job responsibilities, add your skills, add a professional photo if you don't have one.

Three, join LinkedIn groups for veterans in tech and start lurking. Read what people are posting, see what companies are hiring, see what certifications people are recommending. You don't even have to post, just start absorbing information.

Do those three things today and you're already ahead of 80% of people who are getting out.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

**Jacob:** Alright, let's recap Marcus's journey.

Eight years in the Navy as an IT2, decided at the six-year mark to get out. Started with Security+ about 18 months before separation, added CySA+ right before getting out. First civilian job at $68K as a junior security analyst with a DOD contractor. Passed CISSP exam after about eight months in that role. Got recruited for a cybersecurity engineer position at $107K about a year after that. Total timeline from start to six figures: two and a half years.

Key lessons: Start networking early, have a certification roadmap, tailor your resume to every job, leverage your clearance, and always negotiate your offers.
