[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

Your military experience is valuable. Your leadership is real. Your skills are marketable. So why are you sending out fifty resumes and getting zero callbacks? [pause] I'll tell you why - your resume is probably making one or more of the seven critical mistakes that almost every veteran makes. And today, we're fixing all of them.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and I've reviewed hundreds of veteran resumes while building Military Transition Toolkit. I can spot the mistakes from a mile away because I made most of them myself. In today's episode, we're breaking down the seven biggest resume mistakes that are costing veterans job interviews - and more importantly, how to fix them.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering the mistakes that get your resume filtered out by robots before a human ever sees it, the language that confuses civilian hiring managers, and the formatting that makes you look unprofessional. If you're getting ready to apply to civilian jobs and you want to actually get interviews, you need to hear this. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 22-24 minutes]

**Segment 1: Mistake #1 - Using Military Jargon and Acronyms (4-5 minutes)**

Alright, let's start with the biggest, most common mistake that probably 80% of veterans make. [pause] Using military jargon and acronyms that civilian hiring managers don't understand.

Here's what this looks like. I'll read you an actual bullet point from a resume I reviewed recently:

"Led 12-man QRF element conducting daily MSR sweeps and TCP operations throughout AO in support of OEF."

Now, if you've been in the military, especially Army or Marines, you can probably decode that. QRF is Quick Reaction Force. MSR is Main Supply Route. TCP is Traffic Control Point. AO is Area of Operations. OEF is Operation Enduring Freedom.

But put yourself in the shoes of a civilian hiring manager at a tech company in Seattle who's never served. [pause] They have no idea what any of that means. And here's the problem - if they don't understand what you did, they can't see the value you bring. So they move on to the next resume.

This mistake happens because we're so used to military language that we don't even realize we're using jargon. We've been speaking this language for years. But it doesn't translate to the civilian world.

Here's how to fix it.

**Rule #1: Spell out all acronyms on first use**

Instead of "Led 12-man QRF element," write "Led 12-person Quick Reaction Force conducting security operations." The first time you use an acronym, spell it out. If you use it again in a later bullet point, you can use the acronym.

But honestly? For most military acronyms, just don't use them at all. There's usually a civilian equivalent or a plain-English description that works better.

**Rule #2: Translate military terms into civilian business language**

Military term: "Led a squad of 9 soldiers"
Civilian translation: "Managed a team of 9 personnel" or "Supervised 9-person team"

Military term: "Conducted convoy operations"
Civilian translation: "Coordinated secure transportation of personnel and equipment"

Military term: "Maintained 100% accountability of assigned weapons systems valued at $2.5M"
Civilian translation: "Managed inventory and maintenance of high-value equipment portfolio worth $2.5M"

Notice what's happening here. We're keeping the substance - the leadership, the responsibility, the value - but we're putting it in language that any hiring manager can understand.

**Rule #3: Focus on skills and outcomes, not military tasks**

Instead of: "Conducted daily sensitive items inventories per AR 710-2"
Write: "Maintained 100% accountability of high-value assets through detailed inventory management systems"

Instead of: "Briefed battalion command on intelligence products"
Write: "Presented analytical findings and recommendations to senior leadership for strategic decision-making"

Instead of: "Qualified Expert on M4, M9, and M240B weapon systems"
Write: "Demonstrated advanced proficiency with complex technical equipment under high-pressure conditions"

See the difference? We're translating the military experience into skills that civilians recognize - inventory management, presentations to leadership, technical proficiency, performance under pressure.

**Here's a test:** Show your resume to someone who's never been in the military - your spouse, a friend, a family member. Ask them to read it and tell you what you did. If they're confused or they can't explain your job, you've got too much military jargon.

This is fixable, but you have to be intentional about it. Go through your resume line by line and ask yourself: "Would a civilian hiring manager understand this?"

**[Transition statement]**

Alright, that's mistake number one. Now let's talk about a related mistake that kills your chances before a human even sees your resume.

**Segment 2: Mistake #2 - Not Matching Keywords from Job Descriptions (4 minutes)**

Here's something most veterans don't know. [emphasis: "About 95% of companies use something called an Applicant Tracking System - that's ATS - to screen resumes before they ever reach a human."]

An ATS is software that scans your resume looking for specific keywords and qualifications. If your resume doesn't have the right keywords, it gets automatically filtered out. A human recruiter never sees it.

This is why you can apply to 50 jobs and get zero responses. It's not necessarily that you're not qualified. It's that your resume isn't passing the ATS filter.

Here's how ATS systems work:

The company creates a job posting with specific requirements and keywords. The ATS scans incoming resumes looking for those keywords. If your resume has enough matches, it gets scored higher and passed on to a human. If it doesn't have enough matches, it gets automatically rejected.

So if the job posting says "experience with project management" and your resume says "supervised mission planning," the ATS doesn't recognize that as a match, even though they're similar concepts.

This is why you need to match keywords from the job description.

**Here's the strategy:**

Take the job description for the position you're applying to. Read through it carefully and identify the key requirements and skills they're asking for. They usually list these in a "Requirements" or "Qualifications" section.

Let's say the job posting says:
- "5+ years of experience in project management"
- "Strong communication and leadership skills"
- "Experience with budget management and resource allocation"
- "Proficiency with Microsoft Project or similar project management tools"

Your resume needs to include these exact terms - project management, communication, leadership, budget management, resource allocation, project management tools.

If your resume currently says "Managed training operations for 40-person unit," change it to "Managed training projects for 40-person unit, including budget allocation and resource coordination."

Notice how we incorporated their keywords - project management, budget, and resource allocation - while keeping the truth of what you did.

**Important: You're not lying. You're translating your experience into the language the job posting uses.**

If you led training operations, you were doing project management - you had goals, timelines, resources, stakeholders. That's what project management is. You just weren't calling it that in the military.

If you managed people, you were doing budget management when you tracked your unit's expenses or managed equipment.

You're not making things up. You're describing what you did using civilian business terminology.

**Here's the tactical process:**

1. Copy the job description into a document
2. Highlight all the key skills and requirements they list
3. Go through your resume and make sure you're using those exact terms where truthful and applicable
4. Add specific examples that demonstrate those skills

Do this for every job you apply to. Yes, it takes time. Yes, you'll have slightly different versions of your resume for different types of jobs. That's okay. That's what you need to do to get past the ATS and land interviews.

**Segment 3: Mistake #3 - Having One Generic Resume for All Jobs (3-4 minutes)**

This connects directly to what we just talked about. The mistake is thinking you can have one resume that works for every job you apply to.

You can't.

Or, more accurately, you can - but you'll get terrible results.

Here's why. Different jobs require different skills and experiences. A project manager role emphasizes planning, coordination, and stakeholder communication. An operations manager role emphasizes process improvement, team leadership, and execution. A security specialist role emphasizes threat assessment, compliance, and risk management.

These are different focuses, even if you have experience that's relevant to all of them.

If you send the same generic resume to all three types of jobs, your resume won't be optimized for any of them. You'll be a mediocre match for all of them instead of a strong match for one.

The fix is to have multiple versions of your resume tailored to different career paths you're pursuing.

Let's say you're an Army infantry squad leader looking at three possible career paths: law enforcement, corporate operations management, and security consulting.

You would have three versions of your resume:

**Version 1: Law Enforcement Resume**
This version emphasizes your security operations, threat assessment, enforcement of regulations and standards, crisis response, ability to make quick decisions under pressure, and physical fitness.

Bullet points might say:
- "Conducted security operations in high-threat environments requiring constant threat assessment and rapid response to emerging situations"
- "Enforced compliance with regulations and standard operating procedures across 9-person team"
- "Responded to crisis situations requiring immediate decision-making with limited information"

**Version 2: Operations Management Resume**
This version emphasizes your team leadership, process management, training and development, performance accountability, and resource coordination.

Bullet points might say:
- "Managed 9-person team responsible for executing complex multi-phase operations"
- "Developed and implemented training programs that improved team performance by 30%"
- "Coordinated logistics and resource allocation for operations requiring synchronization of personnel, equipment, and timelines"

**Version 3: Security Consulting Resume**
This version emphasizes risk assessment, security planning, protective operations, and consultation with stakeholders.

Bullet points might say:
- "Conducted comprehensive threat and risk assessments for high-value personnel and assets in hostile environments"
- "Designed and implemented security protocols and emergency response procedures"
- "Advised senior leadership on security vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation strategies"

Notice how all three versions are truthful - they're all describing what an infantry squad leader actually does. But they're emphasizing different aspects of the job depending on what the civilian career requires.

This isn't lying. This is positioning your experience for the role you're applying to.

You don't need ten different resume versions. You probably need two or three, depending on what types of jobs you're targeting.

**Segment 4: Mistake #4 - Including Too Much Work History (3 minutes)**

Here's another common mistake. Veterans listing every single thing they've done for their entire military career, going back 15 or 20 years.

Your resume should not be your complete service record.

Here's the rule of thumb: [emphasis: "Highlight your most recent and relevant experience, typically the last 10 years maximum."]

Why? Because hiring managers don't care what you did 15 years ago as an E-1. They care what you've been doing recently and what skills you have now.

If you served 20 years and you've been a senior leader for the last 10, your resume should focus heavily on that senior leadership experience. Your time as a junior enlisted can be summarized briefly or omitted entirely.

Here's how to structure this:

**Most recent role (last 3-5 years):** This gets the most detail. 5-8 bullet points highlighting your responsibilities, accomplishments, leadership scope, and quantifiable results.

**Previous role (5-10 years ago):** Moderate detail. 3-5 bullet points focusing on key accomplishments and progressive responsibility.

**Earlier roles (10+ years ago):** Minimal detail. You can summarize these in one or two lines, or group them together. "Previous positions held: Team Leader, Squad Member (2005-2010)"

The exception is if you have specific experience from earlier in your career that's directly relevant to the job you're applying for. If you're applying to be a network administrator and you were a network tech 12 years ago before moving into leadership, mention that experience. But you still don't need to list every detail.

Another thing - if you have a college degree or advanced certifications, those matter more than what you did as a junior enlisted 15 years ago. Lead with your education and certifications, then go into your work experience.

**Bottom line:** Your resume should be focused, relevant, and recent. Two pages maximum. Most veteran resumes should be one page if you're getting out at 4-6 years, or two pages if you're retiring after 20. If your resume is three or four pages, you're including too much.

**Segment 5: Mistake #5 - Failing to Quantify Accomplishments (3-4 minutes)**

This is a big one. Veterans often list their duties without showing their impact.

Here's what this looks like:

Bad bullet point: "Responsible for maintenance of vehicles"
Better bullet point: "Managed preventive maintenance program for 15 vehicles valued at $2.8M, achieving 98% operational readiness rate"

Bad bullet point: "Led training for soldiers"
Better bullet point: "Designed and delivered leadership training program for 40 personnel, resulting in 25% improvement in team performance metrics"

Bad bullet point: "Managed supply operations"
Better bullet point: "Oversaw $1.2M supply budget and inventory of 2,000+ items, reducing waste by 15% through improved tracking systems"

See the difference? The better versions include numbers - people managed, dollars managed, percentages improved, time saved.

Quantifiable results show impact. They prove you didn't just show up and do a job - you made things better.

Here are the types of numbers you should be including:

**People:** How many people did you lead, train, or manage?
- "Supervised team of 12 personnel"
- "Trained 200+ new employees over 2-year period"

**Money:** What was the budget you managed? What was the value of equipment you were responsible for?
- "Managed $500K operational budget"
- "Maintained accountability for $3.2M in weapons systems and equipment"

**Time:** How much time did you save through improvements? How long were your projects?
- "Reduced average processing time from 48 hours to 24 hours through process optimization"
- "Led 18-month deployment operation in support of overseas mission"

**Percentages:** What improvements did you make?
- "Improved unit readiness from 85% to 96% over 6-month period"
- "Reduced equipment failures by 30% through implementation of preventive maintenance program"

**Scope:** What was the scale of what you managed?
- "Coordinated logistics for 200-person organization across 3 locations"
- "Managed IT infrastructure supporting 1,500 users"

If you don't have exact numbers, estimate. If you're not sure of the dollar value of equipment, look it up. If you don't know the exact percentage improvement, use "significantly improved" or "substantially reduced" - but ideally, try to find numbers.

Numbers make your accomplishments concrete and credible. They show that you think in terms of results and impact, not just tasks.

Go through your resume right now. Count how many bullet points have numbers in them. If it's less than half, you need to add more quantifiable results.

**Segment 6: Mistake #6 - Spelling, Grammar, and Formatting Errors (3 minutes)**

This one should be obvious, but I still see it all the time. Spelling mistakes, grammar errors, inconsistent formatting.

Here's the reality: hiring managers and recruiters may disregard resumes with errors. You can't afford a careless mistake when making a first impression.

If your resume has typos, it signals to the employer that you either don't pay attention to detail or you don't care enough to proofread. Either way, it's not good.

**Common errors I see:**

- Inconsistent formatting: bullet points that don't align, some sections bolded and others not, different fonts or font sizes
- Typos: "mananged" instead of "managed," "recieved" instead of "received"
- Grammar mistakes: "Lead a team" instead of "Led a team," inconsistent verb tenses
- Punctuation errors: some bullet points end with periods, others don't

**Here's how to avoid this:**

**First**, write your resume in a word processor with spell-check enabled. Microsoft Word or Google Docs will catch most typos.

**Second**, read your resume out loud. When you read it silently in your head, your brain auto-corrects mistakes. When you read it out loud, you catch errors you would otherwise miss.

**Third**, have someone else review it. A friend, a spouse, a mentor - someone who can read it with fresh eyes and catch mistakes you've been staring at for too long.

**Fourth**, use a tool like Grammarly. The free version catches most grammar and spelling issues.

**Fifth**, check your formatting consistency. Are all your bullet points using the same style? Are all your dates formatted the same way? Are all your section headers formatted consistently? Go through and make sure everything is uniform.

This is about professionalism. Your resume is your marketing document. It needs to be polished.

**Segment 7: Mistake #7 - Not Including Relevant Keywords for ATS Systems (3 minutes)**

We talked earlier about matching keywords from job descriptions, but there's a related issue - not including basic skills and qualifications that ATS systems are scanning for.

Many ATS systems screen for baseline qualifications before they even get to the specific job requirements.

For example, if the job requires a security clearance and you have one, but you don't explicitly say "Secret Security Clearance" or "Top Secret/SCI Clearance" on your resume, the ATS might filter you out.

If the job requires certain software proficiency - Microsoft Office, specific project management tools, specific technical systems - and you have that experience but you don't list it, the ATS won't know.

**Here's what you need to include:**

**A skills section** listing your technical skills, software proficiencies, certifications, and relevant qualifications.

Example skills section:
```
SKILLS & QUALIFICATIONS
- Secret Security Clearance (active)
- Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification
- Proficient in Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook)
- Experience with project management software (Microsoft Project, Asana)
- Strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills
- Budget management and financial analysis
- Team leadership and personnel development
```

Notice how this section includes both hard skills - specific software and certifications - and soft skills like leadership and communication.

This skills section serves two purposes. One, it helps you pass ATS scans because it's keyword-rich. Two, it gives a human recruiter a quick snapshot of your qualifications.

Another tip - if you have military-specific technical skills or qualifications that have civilian equivalents, include both.

For example:
- "Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP); DOD 8570 IAT Level III compliant"
- "Commercial Driver's License (CDL) Class A; Military equivalent 88M Motor Transport Operator"

This helps both the ATS and the human reviewer understand your qualifications.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap the seven resume mistakes that are costing veterans job interviews.

One - using military jargon and acronyms that civilians don't understand. Translate everything into civilian business language.

Two - not matching keywords from job descriptions. Tailor your resume to include the specific terms the job posting uses.

Three - having one generic resume for all jobs. Create multiple versions tailored to different career paths.

Four - including too much work history. Focus on the last 10 years and your most relevant experience. Two pages maximum.

Five - failing to quantify accomplishments. Use numbers to show your impact - people managed, dollars managed, percentages improved.

Six - spelling, grammar, and formatting errors. Proofread carefully and have someone else review your resume.

Seven - not including relevant keywords for ATS systems. Add a skills section with your technical skills, certifications, and qualifications.

Fix these seven mistakes and you will get more interviews. I guarantee it.
