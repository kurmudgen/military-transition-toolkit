[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

You're separating from the military with 60 days of accrued leave. You can either sell it back for 60 days of base pay, or you can take terminal leave and get paid your full salary while job hunting, interviewing, and starting your civilian career. Most veterans choose terminal leave because it's worth significantly more than selling it back—and it gives you a 2-month head start on your transition while still collecting a military paycheck.

This is Jacob, your host on the Veteran Transition Blueprint podcast. Today we're covering terminal leave strategies—how to maximize your accrued leave, what you should do during terminal leave, and how to time it perfectly so you start your civilian job the day after your EAS date.

Let's get into it.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**What Is Terminal Leave?**

Terminal leave is the period when you use your accrued leave (vacation days) at the end of your military service, immediately before your separation date (EAS). During terminal leave:
- You're still on active duty
- You receive full pay and benefits
- You don't have to report to work
- Your EAS date stays the same

**Example:**
- EAS date: December 31, 2025
- Accrued leave: 60 days
- Terminal leave: November 1, 2025 - December 31, 2025
- You stop working October 31, get paid through December 31, separate on December 31

**Terminal Leave vs. Selling Leave Back**

You can sell back up to 60 days of unused leave, but you only receive base pay (no BAH, no BAS, no special pays).

**Comparison:**
- E-6 with 10 years: Base pay $4,000/month
- Selling 60 days back: $8,000 (one-time payment, taxed)
- Taking terminal leave: $8,000 base + $2,000 BAH + $400 BAS = $10,400 (spread over 2 months, regular tax)

**Plus additional benefits of terminal leave:**
- Keep TRICARE for extra 60 days
- Keep base access and commissary privileges
- Get paid while job hunting
- Can start civilian job during terminal leave if approved

**The Strategic Value:**

Terminal leave is essentially 2 months of paid job hunting. If you plan it right, you can:
1. Interview and secure a civilian job
2. Start your civilian job during terminal leave (with command approval)
3. Have zero gap in income between military and civilian paychecks
4. Collect two paychecks simultaneously for a brief period (if your civilian job starts before your EAS date)

**How Much Leave Should You Have?**

**Target:** 60-90 days of accrued leave

**How to Accumulate:**
- You accrue 2.5 days of leave per month (30 days per year)
- Maximum accrual: 60 days (anything over 60 is "use or lose")
- Exception: If you're deployed or in certain circumstances, you can accrue beyond 60 days under "special leave accrual" (SLA)

**Strategic Planning:**
18-24 months before EAS: Check your current leave balance. If you have less than 60 days, stop taking leave unless absolutely necessary.

12 months before EAS: You should have 45-60 days saved. Request to carry over any SLA if applicable.

6 months before EAS: Finalize your terminal leave dates with your command.

**Pro Tip:** Some commands will pressure you to take leave before your EAS date or limit your terminal leave. Know your rights—you're entitled to use your accrued leave, and commands generally cannot deny terminal leave unless there's a mission-essential requirement.

**What to Do During Terminal Leave**

Terminal leave is not vacation—it's your transition period. Here's the optimal use of your 60-90 days:

**Days 1-14: Administrative Setup**
- Apply for unemployment (in case you don't find a job immediately—you may qualify after EAS)
- Get your VA Benefit Summary Letter
- Schedule VA C&P exams if you have pending claims
- Apply for TSA PreCheck, Global Entry (military members get discounts/free)
- Update your driver's license to remove military designation (if desired)
- Register to vote at your new address
- Transfer utilities, update addresses

**Days 15-45: Job Search Intensive**
- Apply to 5-10 jobs per day
- Network intensively (LinkedIn, veteran groups, hiring conferences)
- Prepare for interviews (practice STAR method responses)
- Research companies and industries
- Attend job interviews (you're free all day, every day)
- Use SkillBridge if you set it up (can overlap with terminal leave in some cases)

**Days 45-60: Transition to Civilian Life**
- If you have a job offer: Negotiate start date, benefits, salary
- If you don't have a job yet: Don't panic. File for unemployment on your EAS date, continue job search
- Relocate if necessary
- Set up new health insurance (or TRICARE Transitional Assistance if you qualify)
- Enroll in VA healthcare
- Attend final out-processing appointments (if required)

**Strategic Tip:** If you receive a civilian job offer during terminal leave, try to negotiate a start date 2-4 weeks before your EAS date (with command approval). This allows you to collect both military pay and civilian pay briefly, and ensures zero income gap.

**Common Terminal Leave Mistakes**

**Mistake #1: Not Saving Enough Leave**

Many service members take leave regularly and end up with only 20-30 days saved. This limits your job search time.

**Solution:** Stop taking leave 12-18 months before EAS unless it's emergency/family-related.

**Mistake #2: Selling Leave Back Instead of Taking Terminal Leave**

Some veterans think selling leave is better because they get a lump sum. Wrong—you lose BAH, BAS, and benefits.

**Solution:** Always take terminal leave unless you have a very specific reason to sell it back.

**Mistake #3: Treating Terminal Leave Like Vacation**

Some veterans go on vacation during terminal leave and waste the job search opportunity.

**Solution:** Use terminal leave strategically for job hunting, networking, and transition preparation.

**Mistake #4: Not Getting Job Offers Lined Up Before Terminal Leave**

Waiting until terminal leave starts to begin your job search means you might not have a job by your EAS date.

**Solution:** Start applying for jobs 3-6 months before your terminal leave begins. Use terminal leave for interviews and finalizing offers, not starting from scratch.

**Mistake #5: Not Coordinating with Command Early**

Some commands require specific paperwork or timelines for terminal leave requests.

**Solution:** Submit your terminal leave request 90-120 days before you plan to start it. Get it approved in writing.

**Special Situations**

**Transitional TRICARE:**

If you take at least 30 days of terminal leave, you may qualify for 180 days of Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) coverage—free TRICARE for 6 months after your EAS date. This is huge if you don't have immediate civilian health insurance.

**Starting Civilian Job During Terminal Leave:**

You can start a civilian job while on terminal leave IF:
1. Your command approves it (get it in writing)
2. It doesn't interfere with any recall or terminal appointments
3. You remain available for military duties if needed (unlikely, but technically possible)

Most commands approve this—it's in everyone's interest for you to have a smooth transition.

**SkillBridge + Terminal Leave:**

SkillBridge (up to 6 months of on-the-job training before EAS) can overlap with terminal leave in some cases. Example:
- 3 months SkillBridge (approved training with company)
- 2 months terminal leave after SkillBridge
- Total: 5 months paid transition period

**Timeline Example: Perfect Terminal Leave Execution**

**January 2025:** 12 months before EAS (December 31, 2025)
- Check leave balance: 50 days accrued
- Goal: Accrue 10 more days before terminal leave
- Stop taking leave except emergencies

**July 2025:** 6 months before EAS
- Leave balance: 60 days
- Submit terminal leave request: November 1 - December 31, 2025
- Begin serious job searching

**September 2025:** 3 months before EAS
- Applied to 100+ jobs
- 10 phone screens
- 3 final interviews scheduled

**October 2025:** 2 months before EAS
- Received 2 job offers
- Negotiated best offer
- Agreed to November 15 start date (during terminal leave)
- Got command approval to start civilian job during terminal leave

**November 1, 2025:** Terminal leave begins
- November 1-14: Last military pay periods, started civilian job November 15
- November 15-30: Collecting both military and civilian pay
- December 1-31: Collecting both paychecks (full double income for December)

**December 31, 2025:** EAS date
- Separated from military
- Already have 1.5 months of civilian work experience
- Zero income gap

**Total benefit:** 2 months paid job search + 1.5 months double pay + smooth transition

[CONCLUSION]

Terminal leave is one of the most valuable transition tools available. Used strategically, it gives you 2-3 months of paid job hunting, allows you to start your civilian career before your EAS date, and ensures zero income gap. Save 60-90 days of leave, start your job search early, use terminal leave for interviews and finalizing offers, and coordinate everything with your command.

Don't sell your leave back unless you have an extraordinary reason. Take terminal leave, use it wisely, and set yourself up for a seamless transition.
