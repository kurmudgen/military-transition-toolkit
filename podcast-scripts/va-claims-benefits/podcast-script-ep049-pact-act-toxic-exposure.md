[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** PACT Act largest VA healthcare and benefits expansion in history. Seventy-four percent approval rate for PACT Act claims - three times higher than pre-PACT Act burn pit approvals. Two point five million claims processed, six point eight billion dollars paid. Twenty-plus burn pit conditions now presumptive. Hypertension now presumptive for Agent Orange. If you deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Gulf War, or Vietnam - you likely qualify. Here's how to file.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**What Is the PACT Act?**

Full name: Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act. Signed into law August 10, 2022. Largest expansion of VA healthcare and benefits in history.

**What Changed:**
- Added 20+ presumptive conditions for burn pit and toxic exposures
- Added 2 new Agent Orange presumptive conditions (hypertension and MGUS)
- Expanded Agent Orange presumptive locations (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam, more)
- Extended VA healthcare eligibility to millions more veterans
- Streamlined claims process for toxic exposure
- Eliminated need to prove exposure for certain deployments/locations

**"Presumptive" Means Easier Claims:**

Normal VA claim: You must prove three things (current condition, in-service event, medical nexus linking them).

Presumptive condition: If you served in qualifying location/time period and have presumptive condition, VA automatically assumes service connection. No need for complex medical nexus letters proving causation.

**Example - Before PACT Act:**
Veteran deployed to Iraq 2005-2006, developed asthma 2018. Had to prove:
1. Current asthma diagnosis
2. Burn pit exposure during deployment
3. Medical opinion stating "asthma more likely than not caused by burn pit exposure"

Burn pit approval rate pre-PACT Act: ~25%. Most denied due to lack of medical evidence proving causation.

**Example - After PACT Act:**
Same veteran. Proves:
1. Current asthma diagnosis
2. Served in Iraq 2005-2006 (qualifying location automatically presumed burn pit exposure)

That's it. Presumptive service connection granted. No nexus letter required. Approval rate now 74%.

**This is massive simplification for veterans.**

**PACT Act By The Numbers (2024-2025 Data):**

- **2.5 million** total claims processed since August 2022
- **1.8+ million** claims approved
- **74% approval rate** (compared to ~25% pre-PACT Act for burn pits)
- **$6.8 billion** in benefits paid to veterans
- **1.5+ million** veterans and survivors approved
- **163 days** average processing time for PACT Act claims
- **42%** of all fiscal 2025 VA disability claims PACT Act-related

**If you deployed 1990 or later, statistically high likelihood you qualify for PACT Act benefits.**

**Who Qualifies - Burn Pit and Gulf War/Post-9/11 Toxic Exposure:**

**Gulf War Era (August 2, 1990 or later):**

Served in or airspace above: Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Persian Gulf, Red Sea.

**Post-9/11 Era (September 11, 2001 or later):**

Served in or airspace above: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen.

**Operations Covered:**
- Operation Enduring Freedom
- Operation Freedom's Sentinel
- Operation Iraqi Freedom
- Operation New Dawn
- Operation Inherent Resolve
- Resolute Support Mission

**"Airspace above" is key:** Aircrew who flew through region qualify even if never landed. Proves you were exposed to airborne particulates.

**Don't have deployment orders?** VA can verify service in qualifying locations through military records. File claim - VA will research.

**The 20+ Burn Pit Presumptive Conditions:**

If you served in qualifying location and have one of these conditions, claim is presumptive (easier approval):

**Respiratory Conditions (Most Common):**
- Asthma (diagnosed after service)
- Chronic bronchitis
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Chronic rhinitis
- Chronic sinusitis
- Constrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis
- Emphysema
- Granulomatous disease
- Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
- Pleuritis
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Sarcoidosis

**Cancers:**
- Head cancer of any type
- Neck cancer of any type
- Respiratory cancer of any type (lung, bronchus, larynx, trachea)
- Gastrointestinal cancer of any type (esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, rectum)
- Reproductive cancer of certain types
- Lymphoma cancers
- Lymphomatic cancers
- Kidney cancer
- Brain cancer
- Melanoma
- Pancreatic cancer
- Glioblastoma

**2024 Additions (June):**
- Male breast cancer
- Urethral cancer
- Cancer of the paraurethral glands

**2025 Additions (January):**
- Leukemias (all types)
- Multiple myeloma
- Myelodysplastic syndrome
- Myelofibrosis
- Urinary bladder cancer
- Other genitourinary cancers

List continues expanding. If you have condition you believe related to burn pits but not on list, still file - VA may grant on individual basis.

**How Burn Pits Caused These Conditions:**

Burn pits used at military bases in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout Middle East to dispose of waste - trash, chemicals, medical waste, batteries, plastics, metals, human waste, everything. Pits burned 24/7, often near living quarters. Toxic smoke contained:

- Particulate matter
- Dioxins
- Heavy metals (lead, mercury)
- Volatile organic compounds
- Carbon monoxide
- Hydrogen cyanide
- And dozens more toxins

Veterans inhaled this daily for months or years. Respiratory systems damaged. Cancer risk increased. Conditions developed during service or years later.

Many veterans didn't realize connection until recent research linked exposures to diseases. If you deployed to these locations and have respiratory or cancer diagnoses, file PACT Act claim.

**Agent Orange Presumptive Conditions (Vietnam and Expanded Locations):**

**Who Qualifies:**

**Vietnam Service (Traditional):**
- Served in Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975
- Served aboard ship in Vietnam's inland waterways ("Brown Water Navy")
- Served on ship operating no more than 12 nautical miles seaward from demarcation line of waters of Vietnam and Cambodia

**PACT Act Expanded Locations (NEW):**
- Any U.S. or Royal Thai military base in Thailand: January 9, 1962 - June 30, 1976
- Laos: December 1, 1965 - September 30, 1969
- Cambodia at Mimot or Krek, Kampong Cham Province: April 16-30, 1969

- Small intestine cancer
- Stomach cancer
- Thyroid cancer
- Urinary tract cancers (kidney, renal pelvis, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra)
- Leukemia (except chronic lymphocytic leukemia)
- And more

If you participated in any radiation exposure activities and have cancer, file claim.

**How to File a PACT Act Claim - Step by Step:**

**Step 1 - Verify Your Eligibility:**

Confirm you served in qualifying location during qualifying time period:
- Check DD-214 for deployment locations/dates
- Verify location on PACT Act qualifying list (va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/)
- If unsure, file anyway - VA will verify through military records

**Step 2 - Get Current Medical Diagnosis:**

Must have current diagnosed condition. If you have symptoms but no diagnosis, see doctor FIRST before filing claim.

- Make appointment with VA healthcare or private doctor
- Describe symptoms and deployment history
- Get formal diagnosis in medical records
- Request copy of medical records showing diagnosis

**Step 3 - File Intent to File (ITF):**

Go to va.gov, file Intent to File. This locks in your effective date (backpay start date) even if you don't submit actual claim for up to 1 year. Takes 2 minutes. Do this IMMEDIATELY.

**Step 4 - Gather Supporting Evidence:**

For presumptive claims, you need less evidence than normal claims. Required:
- Proof of service in qualifying location (DD-214, deployment orders)
- Current diagnosis (medical records from doctor)

Optional but helpful:
- Buddy statements from others who witnessed your symptoms or exposure
- Personal statement describing your exposure and how condition affects you
- Photos of burn pits or toxic exposure at your location (if available)
- Unit records or after-action reports mentioning burn pits

Remember: For presumptive conditions, you do NOT need nexus letter (medical opinion linking condition to service). That's what "presumptive" means - VA presumes connection automatically.

**Step 5 - File Claim Online at VA.gov:**

Create account at va.gov if you don't have one. Navigate to disability benefits section. File VA Form 21-526EZ online. Select PACT Act-related claim option.

Fill in:
- Personal information
- Condition(s) you're claiming
- Dates/locations of service
- Upload supporting documents (DD-214, medical records)

Alternatively: Work with Veterans Service Organization (VSO) - free help from DAV, VFW, American Legion. They'll file for you.

**Step 6 - Attend C&P Exam:**

VA will likely schedule Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam to evaluate your condition's current severity. This determines rating percentage (10%, 20%, 30%, etc.), NOT whether condition is service-connected (that's automatic for presumptives).

**Critical:** DO NOT MISS C&P EXAM. Missing exam = automatic denial even for presumptive conditions.

At exam:
- Describe worst symptoms honestly (don't exaggerate but don't minimize)
- Explain how condition affects daily life, work, relationships
- Mention all symptoms related to condition
- Bring list of medications you take for condition
- Bring any recent test results or medical records examiner might not have

**Step 7 - Wait for Decision (Average 163 Days):**

PACT Act claims average 163 days processing time. You can check status online at va.gov. Respond immediately to any VA requests for additional information.

**Step 8 - Receive Decision Letter:**

Decision letter explains:
- Which conditions approved/denied
- Rating percentage for each approved condition
- Monthly payment amount
- Effective date (backpay calculation starts here)
- How to appeal if disagree

With 74% approval rate for PACT Act claims, statistically strong chance of approval if you meet eligibility.

**Multiple Conditions - File Them All:**

Don't limit yourself to one condition. Many Gulf War/Afghanistan veterans have multiple burn pit-related conditions: asthma + chronic sinusitis + sleep apnea. File all of them in single claim.

Each condition rated separately, then combined using VA math (covered in previous episode). Multiple 10-20% ratings combine to 50-70%+ overall rating.

**Example - Multiple Burn Pit Conditions:**
- Asthma: 30%
- Chronic sinusitis: 10%
- Sleep apnea: 50%
- Combined rating: 70% = $1,759.19/month

vs single condition:
- Only claimed asthma: 30% = $524.31/month

Filing all legitimate conditions increases monthly payment by $1,234.88 = $14,818/year.

**Common PACT Act Claim Mistakes:**

**Mistake 1:** Waiting to file because "my condition isn't that bad yet."
Truth: File now. Backpay goes to your claim date. Waiting costs you retroactive money. Condition will likely worsen over time - file increase request later, but establish service connection NOW.

**Mistake 2:** Not filing because "I can't prove I was near burn pits."
Truth: For presumptive claims, you don't have to prove exposure. Just prove you served in qualifying location. VA presumes you were exposed.

**Mistake 3:** Only filing one condition when you have multiple.
Truth: File every burn pit-related condition you have. Increases overall combined rating and monthly payment.

**Mistake 4:** Assuming existing denied claim can't be reopened.
Truth: If you filed burn pit claim before PACT Act (August 2022) and were denied, file supplemental claim now. PACT Act is "new and relevant evidence" allowing reopening.

**Mistake 5:** Not filing because "I didn't deploy to Iraq/Afghanistan - only support locations."
Truth: Airspace counts. Kuwait counts. Qatar counts. All locations on list qualify. If you were in region supporting operations, check list and file.

**Mistake 6:** Thinking you have to prove burn pit caused your condition.
Truth: Presumptive means no proof required. VA automatically presumes connection. That's entire point of PACT Act.

**Mistake 7:** Filing without current diagnosis.
Truth: "I have breathing problems" not enough. Need doctor's diagnosis: "Asthma" or "COPD" or "Chronic bronchitis." See doctor first, get diagnosis, then file.

**If Your Burn Pit Claim Was Previously Denied - Reopen It:**

Many veterans filed burn pit claims 2010-2022, before PACT Act, and were denied due to lack of medical nexus evidence. PACT Act changes everything.

**How to Reopen:**

File **Supplemental Claim** citing PACT Act as new and relevant evidence. Supplemental claim = new review using different evidence or law.

**Process:**
1. Go to va.gov or work with VSO
2. Select "Supplemental Claim" (not new claim, not Higher-Level Review)
3. List previously denied condition
4. State: "PACT Act (Public Law 117-168) established presumptive service connection for [condition]. Request supplemental review based on new law."
5. Submit with current medical evidence showing you still have condition
6. VA will re-adjudicate using PACT Act presumptive standards

**No time limit on supplemental claims.** If denied in 2015, you can file supplemental claim in 2025. BUT: Effective date will be your new claim date, not original 2015 date. Still worth doing for current and future benefits, just won't get decade of backpay.

**Hypertension - Most Claimed PACT Act Condition:**

Hypertension added as Agent Orange presumptive August 2023. Since then, most claimed condition under PACT Act. Why? Extremely common (affects ~45% of U.S. adults 45+), and millions of Vietnam veterans instantly became eligible.

**Hypertension Rating Levels:**
- **10%:** Diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more
- **20%:** Diastolic blood pressure predominantly 110 or more, OR systolic blood pressure predominantly 200 or more
- **40%:** Diastolic blood pressure predominantly 130 or more, OR systolic blood pressure predominantly 230 or more
- **60%:** Minimum evaluation for cardiomyopathy (heart muscle damage due to hypertension)

Most veterans with diagnosed hypertension qualify for at least 10%. If on medications with controlled blood pressure, typically 10%. If uncontrolled despite medications, possibly 20%+.

**Vietnam Veterans:** If you served in Vietnam and have high blood pressure (even controlled by medication), file claim today. Easy approval, immediate monthly payment.

**Secondary Conditions to Burn Pits and Agent Orange:**

Don't stop at direct presumptive conditions. File secondary claims for conditions CAUSED BY your service-connected conditions.

**Example - Burn Pit Primary + Secondaries:**
- Primary: Asthma (burn pit presumptive) rated 30%
- Secondary to asthma: Sleep apnea (caused by asthma restricting breathing) rated 50%
- Secondary to asthma: Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD - caused by asthma medications and breathing issues) rated 10%
- Combined: 70%+

**Example - Agent Orange Primary + Secondaries:**
- Primary: Diabetes Type 2 (Agent Orange presumptive) rated 20-40%
- Secondary to diabetes: Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage from diabetes) rated 10-40%
- Secondary to diabetes: Erectile dysfunction rated 0-20%
- Combined: 50-80%+

Secondary claims require medical nexus letters (doctor stating secondary condition "more likely than not" caused by service-connected primary). But primary conditions under PACT Act much easier to establish.

**PACT Act Healthcare Expansion:**

Beyond disability compensation, PACT Act expanded VA healthcare eligibility. March 5, 2024, VA opened enrollment to ALL toxic-exposed veterans - years ahead of schedule.

**Who Qualifies for VA Healthcare Under PACT Act:**
- Served in Gulf War/post-9/11 locations (same as disability list)
- Participated in nuclear testing or cleanup
- Served in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Guam, etc. (Agent Orange)
- Many other exposure situations

**Even if not filing disability claim, enroll in VA healthcare.** Free or low-cost healthcare for toxic exposure screening, treatment, monitoring. Establishes medical records that can support future disability claims if conditions worsen.

**Toxic Exposure Screening:**

All veterans now offered toxic exposure screening at VA. Screening includes:
- Questions about deployment history and exposures
- Review of potential toxic exposure situations
- Assessment for conditions related to exposures
- Referrals for further evaluation if needed

Take advantage of this. Establishes documentation of exposure and symptoms even if not currently filing disability claim.

**Registry Programs:**

VA maintains registries for certain exposures. Joining registry provides free health exam and monitoring. Registries include:
- Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry
- Gulf War Registry
- Agent Orange Registry
- Ionizing Radiation Registry

Register at va.gov. Free exam, establishes exposure documentation, monitors for emerging conditions.

**Action Steps:**

**Step 1 (Today):** File Intent to File at va.gov - takes 2 minutes, protects backpay

**Step 2 (This Week):** Review your deployment history - check DD-214, verify qualifying locations on PACT Act list

**Step 3 (This Month):** Schedule medical appointments for any undiagnosed symptoms you believe related to toxic exposure. Get formal diagnoses.

**Step 4 (Next Month):** File PACT Act claim online or with VSO. Include all qualifying conditions.

**Step 5 (Ongoing):** Enroll in VA healthcare if not already enrolled. Get toxic exposure screening. Join applicable registry.

**Step 6 (When Scheduled):** Attend C&P exam (DO NOT MISS).

**Step 7 (After Decision):** If approved, verify payment. If denied, review decision letter and appeal if appropriate.

**If You Were Denied Pre-PACT Act:** File supplemental claim citing PACT Act as new evidence.
