[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

When you retire from the military after 20+ years, you keep TRICARE for life - but it's not free and it's not the same as active duty TRICARE. In 2025, retired families pay between $365 and $1,159 per year for TRICARE Select, or $744 to $901 for TRICARE Prime, depending on when you joined the military. That's substantially less than civilian insurance that could run $15,000-$20,000 annually for family coverage. When you turn 65, TRICARE transitions to TRICARE for Life - but you must have Medicare Part B, which costs $174.70 per month for most retirees, or $2,096 per year. If you're medically retiring before 20 years, you keep TRICARE for yourself, but your family transitions differently. And for young adults ages 21-26, there's TRICARE Young Adult costing $337 to $727 per month per dependent - significantly more expensive than keeping them on civilian insurance. The TRICARE retirement system is complex, with different rules for when you joined, how you retired, and your age. Getting this wrong could cost you thousands or leave you without coverage at critical times. I'm Jacob, Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're breaking down exactly how TRICARE works for retirees and families, the costs, the coverage, and how it compares to VA healthcare and civilian insurance. This is Veteran Transition Blueprint.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**TRICARE for Retirees - The Basics**

First, let's clarify who qualifies for TRICARE retiree coverage.

**Eligibility:**

- Retired service members with 20+ years of service (retired pay)
- Medically retired service members with disability rating from DoD (may be less than 20 years)
- Family members of eligible retirees (spouse, children under 21, or 23 if in college)
- Surviving spouses and children of deceased service members or retirees

**The key difference from active duty:** Active duty TRICARE is free for service members and low-cost for families. Retiree TRICARE requires enrollment fees, copays, and out-of-pocket costs. It's still excellent coverage at below-market rates, but it's not free.

**Group A vs. Group B - Critical Distinction**

TRICARE split retirees into two groups based on when military service began. This affects your costs significantly.

**Group A:** Your initial enlistment or appointment began BEFORE January 1, 2018. If you joined before 2018, you're Group A.

**Group B:** Your initial enlistment or appointment began ON OR AFTER January 1, 2018. If you joined in 2018 or later, you're Group B.

**Why this matters:** Group B pays higher enrollment fees for TRICARE Select and has the same catastrophic cap as Group A for Prime, but some slightly different cost-sharing. If you're Group B, you'll pay more for Select coverage - $579 individual vs. $181.92 for Group A, or $1,159 family vs. $365 for Group A.

**How to know your group:** Check your military service start date. First day of initial enlistment or commissioning determines your group.

**TRICARE Prime for Retirees**

TRICARE Prime is the managed care option - structured network, assigned primary care manager (PCM), referrals required for specialists.

**2025 Enrollment Fees (Annual):**
- Group A: $372 individual, $744 family
- Group B: $438.96 individual, $900.96 family

You pay these fees once per year to enroll. This is IN ADDITION to copays for care.

**Copayments:**
- Primary care: $25 per visit
- Specialty care: $25 per visit (with referral)
- Emergency care: $65
- Urgent care: $25
- Inpatient care: $181 per admission or $25 per day (whichever is less)

**No annual deductible** for Prime. You pay copays, but there's no deductible you have to meet before coverage starts.

**Catastrophic cap (maximum out-of-pocket):**
- Group A: $3,000 per year
- Group B: $4,509 per year

Once you hit this cap in copays and cost-shares, TRICARE covers everything else for the rest of the calendar year at 100% with no additional copays.

**Pros of Prime:**
- Lower out-of-pocket costs if you use care frequently
- Coordinated care through assigned PCM
- No need to file claims - TRICARE handles billing directly with network providers
- Preventive care emphasizes staying healthy

**Cons of Prime:**
- Less provider choice - must use network providers
- Referrals required for specialists
- Not available in all geographic areas
- If you live outside Prime service area, you can't enroll

**TRICARE Select for Retirees**

TRICARE Select is the fee-for-service option - you choose your providers, see specialists without referrals, more flexibility.

**2025 Enrollment Fees (Annual):**
- Group A: $181.92 individual, $364.92 family
- Group B: $579 individual, $1,158.96 family

**Annual Deductible (Group B only):**
- E-5 and above: $386 per family
- E-4 and below: $128 per family

Group A has no annual deductible for Select.

**Copayments for outpatient care:**
- Primary care: $37 (Group A), $32 (Group B)
- Specialty care: $45 (Group A), $37 (Group B)
- Emergency care: $99 (Group A), $81 (Group B)
- Urgent care: $45 (Group A), $37 (Group B)

**Inpatient care:**
- $250 per admission (Group A), $205 per admission (Group B)
- OR $25 per day, whichever is less

**Catastrophic cap:**
- Group A: $4,261 per year
- Group B: $4,509 per year

**Pros of Select:**
- Freedom to choose any TRICARE-authorized provider
- No referrals needed for specialists
- Available nationwide (not limited to Prime service areas)
- Lower enrollment fees than Prime (especially for Group A)

**Cons of Select:**
- Higher copays per visit than Prime
- You may need to file claims with TRICARE if provider doesn't accept it
- Annual deductible for Group B
- Higher catastrophic cap than Prime for Group A

**Prime vs. Select - Which Should You Choose?**

**Choose Prime if:**
- You live in a Prime service area (major metropolitan areas with military treatment facilities)
- You don't mind having an assigned primary care manager
- You prefer coordinated care and lower copays
- You expect to use healthcare frequently
- You're Group A and the enrollment fee savings over Select aren't substantial enough to offset copay differences

**Choose Select if:**
- You live outside Prime service areas (no choice - Select is your only option)
- You want freedom to choose any doctor or specialist
- You don't want to deal with referrals
- You have established civilian providers you want to continue seeing
- You're Group A and want to minimize annual enrollment fees
- You're healthy and don't expect frequent healthcare use

**Financial comparison example (Group A retiree):**

**Scenario: Family with routine healthcare (10 primary care visits, 2 specialist visits per year):**

TRICARE Prime: $744 enrollment + $250 (10 × $25 primary) + $50 (2 × $25 specialist) = $1,044 annual
TRICARE Select: $364.92 enrollment + $370 (10 × $37 primary) + $90 (2 × $45 specialist) = $824.92 annual

In this scenario, Select is cheaper.

**Scenario: Family with significant healthcare use (20 primary, 10 specialist, 2 ER visits):**

TRICARE Prime: $744 enrollment + $500 (20 × $25 primary) + $250 (10 × $25 specialist) + $130 (2 × $65 ER) = $1,624 annual
TRICARE Select: $364.92 enrollment + $740 (20 × $37 primary) + $450 (10 × $45 specialist) + $198 (2 × $99 ER) = $1,752.92 annual

Prime is slightly cheaper for heavy users, but Select still competitive.

**Both options provide excellent coverage** well below civilian insurance costs. Many families pay $12,000-$20,000 per year for civilian family coverage. Even Group B Select at $1,159 enrollment plus copays is substantially less.

**TRICARE for Life - Medicare-Eligible Retirees**

When you turn 65, you become eligible for Medicare. At that point, TRICARE transitions to TRICARE for Life (TFL).

**The requirements:**

You MUST have Medicare Part A AND Medicare Part B to use TRICARE for Life. If you're eligible for Medicare based on age and you want to keep TRICARE, you must enroll in both parts.

**Medicare Part A:** Most retirees get Part A free (hospital insurance) because they or their spouse paid Medicare taxes during their working years.

**Medicare Part B:** This is medical insurance (doctors, outpatient care). Part B costs $174.70 per month in 2025 for most people (standard premium). Higher-income retirees pay more based on income brackets.

**Critical timing:** Sign up for Medicare Part B 3-4 months BEFORE your 65th birthday. If you miss this window and enroll late, you'll pay a lifetime late-enrollment penalty - an additional 10% per year you were late, forever.

**How TRICARE for Life works:**

Medicare becomes your primary insurance. TRICARE for Life becomes your secondary insurance and supplement. When you receive care:

1. Provider bills Medicare first
2. Medicare pays its share (typically 80% for Part B services)
3. TRICARE pays the remaining Medicare-approved amount
4. You usually pay nothing out-of-pocket

**TFL benefits:**
- No enrollment fees for TRICARE for Life (you're paying for Medicare Part B, which is the cost)
- No copays for most care
- Covers Medicare deductibles and cost-sharing
- Covers some things Medicare doesn't (like prescriptions until you hit Part D coverage)
- Worldwide coverage (Medicare only covers US, but TFL covers you overseas)

**Annual cost for TFL:**

Medicare Part B: $174.70/month × 12 = $2,096.40 per year
TRICARE for Life: $0 enrollment fees
Out-of-pocket: Typically $0-$500 per year depending on what care you need

**Compare this to**: The $900-$1,159 enrollment fees plus copays you were paying for Prime or Select before 65, PLUS you're getting better coverage. TFL is one of the best health insurance deals in America for seniors.

**Important note:** You must keep paying Medicare Part B premiums to maintain TRICARE for Life eligibility. If you drop Part B, you lose TFL and can't get regular TRICARE Prime or Select back (since you're Medicare-eligible).

**TRICARE for Medically Retired Service Members**

If you're medically retiring before 20 years, your TRICARE situation is slightly different.

**Your coverage:** As the medically retired service member, you're eligible for retiree TRICARE (Prime or Select) immediately upon retirement with medical retirement orders. You pay the same enrollment fees and copays as 20-year retirees.

**Your family's coverage:** Your family members (spouse, children) are also eligible for TRICARE retiree coverage as your dependents.

**Special consideration for CRSC/CRDP:** If you're receiving both military retirement pay and VA disability compensation (through CRDP or CRSC), you still keep TRICARE. The fact that you're receiving VA compensation doesn't affect your TRICARE eligibility.

**TRICARE vs. VA Healthcare:** You can have both. Many medically retired veterans enroll in both TRICARE and VA healthcare. Use TRICARE for family coverage and immediate care, use VA healthcare for service-connected conditions to avoid copays. They work together - you just can't bill both for the same service.

**TRICARE for Family Members**

Let's talk about coverage for spouses and children specifically.

**Spouses:** Your spouse is eligible for TRICARE as long as you're eligible and they're enrolled in DEERS. They pay no separate enrollment fee - the family enrollment fee covers everyone. Coverage continues for life as long as you remain married and they don't remarry if you die.

**Children under 21 (or 23 if full-time student):** Covered under your family TRICARE plan at no additional cost beyond the family enrollment fee. When they turn 21 (or 23), their regular TRICARE eligibility ends.

**Children 21-26 - TRICARE Young Adult:**

For dependents ages 21-26 who age out of regular TRICARE, there's TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) - a premium-based plan.

**2025 TYA Costs:**
- TYA Prime: $727 per month ($8,724 per year) per dependent
- TYA Select: $337 per month ($4,044 per year) per dependent

**Yes, you read that right** - $727/month for Prime coverage for one young adult. This is substantially more expensive than keeping them on an ACA marketplace plan or employer-sponsored insurance.

**TYA catastrophic cap:** $4,509 per year

**TYA does NOT include dental or vision coverage** - medical and pharmacy only.

**Why TYA is so expensive:** The premiums are designed to cover the full actuarial cost of healthcare for healthy young adults. There's no DoD subsidy like there is for regular TRICARE.

**The reality:** Most military families do NOT put their young adult dependents on TYA because it's cheaper to use civilian insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, many employer plans and ACA marketplace plans cover dependents to age 26 at no additional cost or minimal cost. TYA makes financial sense only if your dependent has significant healthcare needs where the TYA catastrophic cap benefits you, or if they can't get other coverage.

**Special consideration for disabled dependents:** Children who are disabled before age 21 may remain eligible for regular TRICARE beyond age 21 at no additional cost. They don't age out at 21/23 and don't need TYA. Must have documentation of disability.

**TRICARE for Surviving Spouses and Children**

If a retiree dies, the surviving spouse and children can keep TRICARE.

**Surviving spouse:** Eligible for TRICARE for life unless they remarry before age 55. If they remarry at 55 or older, they keep TRICARE. Enrollment fees and copays are the same as for retirees.

**Surviving children:** Eligible until age 21 (or 23 if in college), same as regular dependent children. Can use TYA from 21-26 if needed.

**This benefit is valuable:** Losing TRICARE coverage along with losing a spouse would be devastating. Surviving spouses keeping TRICARE provides critical healthcare security.

**TRICARE vs. VA Healthcare - Using Both**

Many military retirees are eligible for both TRICARE and VA healthcare. You can use both strategically.

**What TRICARE covers that VA doesn't:**
- Family members (VA healthcare is only for the veteran)
- Dental (limited in VA, better coverage through TRICARE dental plans)
- Immediate access without enrollment priority delays

**What VA covers that TRICARE doesn't (or does better):**
- No-cost care for service-connected conditions if you're Priority Group 1
- Mental health care specialized for veteran issues
- Prosthetics and specialized equipment
- Long-term care in some situations

**The strategy:** Use TRICARE for family coverage and non-service-connected care. Use VA healthcare for your service-connected conditions to avoid TRICARE copays. Both systems accept the other as secondary insurance in some situations, but generally you pick one for each episode of care.

**Example:** Retired E-7, 60% VA disability, Priority Group 1 VA healthcare, TRICARE Select retiree.

- Uses VA healthcare for PTSD treatment, back care, and annual checkups related to service-connected conditions - no cost
- Uses TRICARE Select for broken arm, high blood pressure management, family healthcare - pays copays
- Spouse and kids use TRICARE exclusively since they're not eligible for VA

**TRICARE Reserve Select and Retired Reserve**

If you're in the Reserves or National Guard, different TRICARE options apply.

**TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS):** For Selected Reserve members not on active duty orders. This is a premium-based plan.

**2025 TRS Costs:**
- Individual: $52.54/month ($630.48/year)
- Family: $238.84/month ($2,866.08/year)

This is available while you're actively drilling in the Selected Reserve.

**TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR):** For Reserve/Guard retirees (qualified for Reserve retirement but not yet receiving retirement pay - the "gray area" between qualifying and turning 60).

**2025 TRR Costs:**
- Individual: $631.26/month ($7,575.12/year)
- Family: $1,513.04/month ($18,156.48/year)

**The TRR problem:** These premiums are extremely high - higher than many civilian insurance plans. Most Reserve retirees in the gray area use employer insurance or ACA marketplace plans instead.

**Once you turn 60 and start receiving Reserve retirement pay,** you become eligible for regular TRICARE retiree coverage (Prime or Select) at the much lower enrollment fees.

**Final Cost Comparison and Decision Framework**

Let's put real numbers on your TRICARE retirement options:

**Scenario: Retired E-7, spouse, two children ages 16 and 19, Group A**

**Option 1 - TRICARE Select:** $364.92/year enrollment + estimated $1,000 copays = $1,364.92/year for family of 4

**Option 2 - TRICARE Prime:** $744/year enrollment + estimated $600 copays (lower per-visit) = $1,344/year for family of 4

**Option 3 - Civilian employer plan:** $8,000-$15,000/year typical family premium + $3,000-$5,000 deductible + copays = $11,000-$20,000 total

**TRICARE wins by $9,000-$18,000 per year.**

**At age 65 - TRICARE for Life:** Medicare Part B $2,096/year + spouse Medicare Part B $2,096 = $4,192/year for couple + minimal out-of-pocket

**Civilian Medicare + Supplement:** Medicare Part B $2,096 + Medigap Plan G $1,500-$2,500/year PER PERSON = $7,192-$9,192 for couple

**TFL saves $3,000-$5,000 per year over civilian Medicare supplementation.**

**Key takeaway:** TRICARE retiree coverage is one of the most valuable military benefits. Over a 30-year retirement (ages 40-70), TRICARE could save you $300,000-$500,000 compared to civilian insurance costs.

**Enroll immediately upon retirement.** Don't delay. Don't assume you'll "get it later." Enroll in DEERS, enroll in TRICARE Prime or Select, and lock in your coverage.

**Description:**
TRICARE retiree coverage provides comprehensive healthcare for military retirees and families after 20+ years of service, at costs dramatically below civilian insurance. Host Jacob (Navy E6, medical retirement) explains the 2025 options: TRICARE Prime ($372-$900 annual enrollment fee, $25 copays, $3,000-$4,509 catastrophic cap), TRICARE Select ($182-$1,159 annual enrollment, $32-$37 primary care copays, $4,261-$4,509 catastrophic cap), TRICARE for Life at age 65 (requires Medicare Part B $174.70/month, typically zero out-of-pocket), and TRICARE Young Adult 21-26 ($337-$727/month per dependent). Covers Group A vs B cost differences, Prime vs Select decision factors, and how TRICARE compares to VA healthcare and civilian insurance, saving retirees $9,000-$18,000 annually.

**Key Points:**
• TRICARE retiree eligibility: 20+ year retirees, medical retirees, surviving family members - NOT free like active duty, requires enrollment fees and copays
• Group A (enlisted before Jan 1, 2018) vs Group B (on/after Jan 1, 2018) determines costs - Group B pays significantly more for Select
• TRICARE Prime 2025: $372 individual/$744 family (Group A), $438.96/$900.96 (Group B), $25 copays, $3,000 catastrophic cap (Group A), $4,509 (Group B), no deductible
• TRICARE Select 2025: $181.92 individual/$364.92 family (Group A), $579/$1,158.96 (Group B), $37 primary care copay (Group A), $32 (Group B), catastrophic cap $4,261 (Group A), $4,509 (Group B)
• Prime offers lower copays but requires network providers and referrals; Select offers provider freedom but higher per-visit costs
• TRICARE for Life (TFL) starts at age 65 - MUST have Medicare Part A and Part B ($174.70/month standard premium in 2025), no TFL enrollment fees, typically zero out-of-pocket, Medicare primary/TFL secondary
• Enroll in Medicare Part B 3-4 months before turning 65 or face lifetime 10% annual late-enrollment penalty
• TRICARE Young Adult 21-26: $727/month TYA Prime or $337/month TYA Select per dependent ($8,724-$4,044/year) - NO dental or vision, often cheaper to use civilian insurance
• Can use both TRICARE and VA healthcare: Use VA for service-connected conditions (no cost Priority Group 1), TRICARE for family and non-service-connected care
• TRICARE saves $9,000-$18,000/year vs civilian family insurance; over 30-year retirement saves $300,000-$500,000
• Surviving spouses keep TRICARE for life unless remarry before age 55; remarry at 55+ keeps coverage
