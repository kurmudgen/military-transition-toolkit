[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** PTSD seventy percent equals seventeen hundred fifty-nine monthly. Thirty percent equals five hundred twenty-four. Difference: one thousand two hundred thirty-five monthly, fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty annually. Understanding rating criteria determines which you get. Sleep apnea with CPAP automatic fifty percent - twelve hundred seventy-five monthly. Tinnitus only ten percent - one hundred seventy-one monthly. Here's what VA looks for rating most common conditions.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**How VA Rates Disabilities:**

Every condition VA rates has specific diagnostic code (DC) in 38 CFR Part 4 - Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Each code lists:
- Possible rating percentages (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.)
- Specific symptoms/criteria required for each percentage
- How to measure severity (objective tests, functional limitations, subjective symptoms)

**Rating based on severity, not condition itself.** Two veterans with PTSD can have 30% or 70% depending on symptom severity and functional impairment. Understanding criteria helps you communicate symptoms matching higher ratings.

**Today's focus: Most claimed/impactful conditions and how they're rated.**

---

**PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) - DC 9411:**

**Most common mental health disability claim.** Rated 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100% based on occupational and social impairment.

**Critical Concept:** VA rates PTSD (and all mental health conditions) on highest level of symptoms, not average. If you have good days and terrible days, rating based on terrible days. Document worst symptoms.

**0% Rating (Non-Compensable):**
Service-connected PTSD with symptoms but no occupational or social impairment. Rare. Usually means condition diagnosed but minimal symptoms, or symptoms controlled with treatment. Still valuable - establishes service connection, qualifies for VA healthcare, easier to file increase later if worsens.

**10% Rating:**
Mild symptoms with only slight occupational and social impairment. Think: Occasional difficulty at work but generally functioning, some anxiety/hypervigilance but doesn't significantly affect relationships or daily life.

**30% Rating:**
"Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks."

**Symptoms at 30% level:**
- Depressed mood
- Anxiety
- Suspiciousness
- Panic attacks (weekly or less often)
- Chronic sleep impairment
- Mild memory loss (forgetting names, directions, recent events)

**Key phrase: "Occasional" and "intermittent."** Not constant debilitating symptoms, but regular impairment affecting work sometimes.

**50% Rating:**
"Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity."

**Symptoms at 50% level:**
- Flattened affect (reduced emotional expression)
- Panic attacks occurring once a week or more often
- Difficulty understanding complex commands
- Impaired judgment
- Impaired memory (for names, directions, recent events)
- Mood disturbance
- Trouble establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships
- Disturbances of motivation and mood

**Key phrase: "Reduced reliability and productivity."** You're having significant trouble at work, relationships suffering, but you're still functioning somewhat.

**70% Rating (MOST COMMON for PTSD):**
"Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in MOST areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood."

**Symptoms at 70% level:**
- Suicidal ideation
- Obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities
- Illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech
- Near-continuous panic or depression affecting ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively
- Impaired impulse control (unprovoked irritability with periods of violence)
- Spatial disorientation
- Neglect of personal appearance and hygiene
- Difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or work-like setting)
- Inability to establish and maintain effective relationships

**Key phrase: "Deficiencies in MOST areas."** Not just work problems or relationship problems - multiple life areas significantly impaired. Near-continuous symptoms, not just occasional.

**100% Rating:**
"Total occupational and social impairment."

**Symptoms at 100% level:**
- Gross impairment in thought processes or communication
- Persistent delusions or hallucinations
- Grossly inappropriate behavior
- Persistent danger of hurting self or others
- Intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene)
- Disorientation to time or place
- Memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name

**Key: "Total impairment."** Cannot work at all, cannot maintain relationships, cannot function independently. Often requires hospitalization or constant care.

**PTSD C&P Exam - What to Communicate:**

Don't minimize. If you have panic attacks twice weekly, say that. If you can't go to crowded stores without severe anxiety, explain that. If you've lost jobs because you can't handle stress, detail that. If family relationships damaged because you're withdrawn or have anger outbursts, describe that specifically.

**Example - Communicating for 70% vs 30%:**

**30% communication (will get 30% rating):** "I have some anxiety and don't sleep great. I get stressed at work sometimes but I manage. My family says I'm more irritable than I used to be."

**70% communication (will get 70% rating):** "I have panic attacks 3-4 times per week that make me unable to leave my house. I've been fired from two jobs in the past year because I couldn't handle workplace stress and had anger outbursts with coworkers. I haven't attended family events in a year because I can't be around crowds without severe anxiety. My spouse says I've become a different person - withdrawn, angry, unpredictable. I think about suicide weekly but haven't made plans. I can't go to grocery stores during busy hours. I've neglected my hygiene because depression makes it hard to care."

Same veteran. Different communication. Different rating. Difference = $1,235/month for life.

**PTSD - Proposed Changes Coming (Late 2024/Early 2025):**

VA proposing domain-based assessment system instead of current ratings. Elimination of 0% rating. Changes not yet implemented. When they are, we'll update. For now, current system still applies.

---

**TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) - DC 8045:**

**TBI rated based on RESIDUALS (ongoing symptoms), not initial injury.** Even mild TBI during service can cause permanent residuals rated high.

**Rating levels:** 0%, 10%, 40%, 70%, 100%

**VA evaluates 10 areas of dysfunction:**
1. Memory, attention, concentration, executive functions
2. Judgment
3. Social interaction
4. Orientation
5. Motor activity (including speech)
6. Visual spatial orientation
7. Subjective symptoms (headaches, dizziness)
8. Neurobehavioral effects
9. Communication
10. Consciousness

**Most severe domain determines overall rating.** Even if 9 domains rate at 10%, one domain at 70% = 70% overall rating.

**0% Rating:**
TBI with no residuals or minimal residuals not interfering with work/social functioning.

**10% Rating:**
"Mild" residuals in one or more areas. Examples:
- Mild memory problems
- Occasional headaches
- Mild attention difficulties
- Subjective complaints with minimal objective findings

**40% Rating:**
"Moderate" residuals. Examples:
- Moderate memory impairment (forgets appointments, conversations)
- Frequent severe headaches
- Moderate difficulty with executive function (planning, organizing)
- Moderate impairment of social interaction

**70% Rating:**
"Severe" residuals. Examples:
- Severe memory impairment requiring external aids
- Near-continuous debilitating headaches
- Severe executive function problems preventing independent living
- Marked impairment of social interaction

**100% Rating:**
"Total" impairment. Cannot function independently at all.

**TBI Often Has Overlapping Symptoms:**

TBI commonly causes: Headaches/migraines, sleep disorders, depression, cognitive issues, balance problems, tinnitus.

**Pyramiding Rule:** Can't rate same symptom twice. If headaches rated under TBI, can't also file separate migraine claim for same headaches. BUT if you have multiple distinct issues (TBI cognitive problems + separate service-connected migraines from different cause), both can be rated.

**TBI C&P Exam Tips:**

Bring family member who can describe how TBI affects you. You might not realize how much your memory or judgment is impaired - family member provides objective perspective.

Document cognitive problems specifically: "I forget appointments, I've gotten lost driving familiar routes 3 times this month, I can't follow multi-step instructions at work, I've lost jobs because I can't remember training."

**Tinnitus - DC 6260:**

**Simplest VA rating: 10% only. That's it.**

Doesn't matter:
- How loud your tinnitus
- How debilitating
- One ear or both ears
- Constant or intermittent

If diagnosed tinnitus and service-connected = 10% = $171.23/month.

**Why so simple?** VA considers tinnitus subjective symptom impossible to objectively measure. Rather than complex rating system, flat 10% for anyone with tinnitus.

**No bilateral factor.** Tinnitus in both ears still 10%, not 20%. This is unique - most conditions affecting bilateral body parts get bilateral factor.

**Proposed Changes Coming (After April 2025):**

VA proposed eliminating standalone tinnitus rating. Under proposal:
- If you have compensable hearing loss (10%+), tinnitus rating goes away (included in hearing loss rating)
- If hearing loss non-compensable (0%), keep 10% for tinnitus

**Current recipients protected ("grandfathered").** If you have 10% tinnitus now, you keep it even after changes.

**Strategy:** File tinnitus claim NOW if you have it. Once changes implement, harder to get standalone rating.

**Tinnitus is Most-Claimed VA Condition:**

Why? Almost every combat veteran exposed to loud noise (gunfire, explosions, aircraft, vehicles). Tinnitus extremely common. Easy to document. Guaranteed 10% if service-connected.

**Tinnitus as Gateway to Higher Ratings:**

10% tinnitus alone = $171/month. But tinnitus often comes with:
- Hearing loss (0-100% depending on severity)
- Migraines secondary to tinnitus (0-50%)
- Sleep disorders secondary to tinnitus (0-100%)
- Anxiety secondary to constant ringing (0-100%)

**Example:**
- Tinnitus: 10%
- Hearing loss: 10%
- Migraines secondary to tinnitus: 30%
- Sleep disturbance secondary to tinnitus: 10%

Combined: 50% = $1,075.16/month vs $171 for tinnitus alone.

**Don't stop at tinnitus. File related conditions too.**

**Sleep Apnea - DC 6847:**

**Current ratings:** 0%, 30%, 50%, 100%

**0%:** Asymptomatic sleep apnea or sleep apnea with documented sleep disorder but without daytime symptoms.

**30%:** Persistent daytime hypersomnolence (excessive sleepiness).

**50%:** Requires use of breathing assistance device such as CPAP machine.

**100%:** Chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale (heart damage), OR requires tracheostomy.

**Key: CPAP machine = automatic 50%.** Most common rating for sleep apnea. Prescription for CPAP = $1,075.16/month.

**You don't have to prove you USE CPAP regularly.** Just need prescription/medical necessity for CPAP. Even if you can't tolerate it, still qualifies for 50%.

**Sleep Apnea - Proposed Changes (Not Yet Implemented):**

VA proposing changes where CPAP prescription alone won't automatically equal 50%. New criteria will focus on:
- Effectiveness of treatment (does CPAP actually control symptoms?)
- Compliance (do you use it?)
- Ongoing functional impairment

**Can still get 50% under proposed rules if:**
- CPAP ineffective at controlling symptoms
- Unable to tolerate CPAP due to other condition (e.g., PTSD makes you feel claustrophobic with mask)
- Sleep apnea causes ongoing functional impairment despite treatment

**Current recipients protected.** If you have 50% sleep apnea now, changes won't reduce your rating.

**Strategy:** File sleep apnea claim now if you have diagnosis and CPAP prescription.

**Sleep Apnea Often Secondary:**

Common primary conditions causing/aggravating sleep apnea:
- PTSD (hypervigilance prevents deep sleep)
- Obesity from service-connected conditions limiting mobility
- Sinusitis (airway restriction)
- Hypothyroidism
- GERD

If you have service-connected condition that contributed to sleep apnea, file as secondary with nexus letter. Easier to prove than independent service connection.

**Back Conditions - Most Common Physical Disability:**

Back conditions rated under multiple diagnostic codes depending on specific diagnosis:

**General Back Pain/Lumbar Strain - DC 5237:**
Rated on range of motion and incapacitating episodes.

**10%:** Forward flexion of thoracolumbar spine to 60 degrees or less, OR combined range of motion of 120 degrees or less

**20%:** Forward flexion to 30 degrees or less, OR combined range of motion of 60 degrees or less, OR muscle spasm on extreme forward bending

**40%:** Forward flexion to 0 degrees (can't bend forward at all), OR ankylosis (fusion) of entire spine

**Additional ratings for incapacitating episodes:**
- 10%: At least 2 incapacitating episodes per year
- 20%: At least 4 episodes per year
- 40%: At least 6 episodes per year
- 60%: Incapacitating episodes of at least 6 weeks total duration per year

**"Incapacitating" means:** Bed rest prescribed by physician and need for treatment by physician.

**Key for Back C&P Exams:**

- Stop at pain during range-of-motion testing (don't push through)
- If muscle spasm present, examiner should note it (qualifies for 20% minimum)
- Document incapacitating episodes (ER visits, doctor appointments for flare-ups, bed rest)

**Back Pain Often Has Secondaries:**

- Radiculopathy (nerve pain in legs) - separate rating 10-40%
- Erectile dysfunction (nerve damage) - 0-20%
- Depression from chronic pain - 0-100%
- Sleep disorders - 0-100%

One back injury can cascade to 70-80%+ combined.

---

**Knee Conditions - DC 5260 (Various Codes):**

Rated on range of motion, instability, and pain.

**Examples:**

**Limited Flexion:**
- 10%: Flexion limited to 45 degrees
- 20%: Flexion limited to 30 degrees
- 30%: Flexion limited to 15 degrees

**Limited Extension:**
- 10%: Extension to 10 degrees
- 20%: Extension to 20 degrees
- 30%: Extension to 30 degrees

**Instability:**
- 10%: Slight instability
- 20%: Moderate instability
- 30%: Severe instability

**Arthritis:**
- 10%: X-ray evidence of arthritis
- 20%: With painful motion and symptoms

**Multiple Knee Issues Get Combined:**

If you have limited flexion (10%) + instability (10%) + arthritis (10%), VA uses "highest rating" principle but can consider multiple factors for single joint.

**Bilateral Knee Claims:**

If both knees affected, file for both. Bilateral factor applied (extra 10% of combined bilateral rating).

Example: Right knee 20% + Left knee 10% = 28%, bilateral factor adds 2.8% = 30.8%

---

**Hearing Loss - DC 6100:**

**Rated on decibel loss across specific frequencies.** Requires audiogram (hearing test).

**0%:** Slight hearing loss not meeting minimum threshold for compensation
**10%:** Thresholds of 40-55 decibels in specified frequencies
**20%:** Thresholds of 55-70 decibels
(And so on up to 100% for total deafness)

**Separate ratings for each ear, then combined.** Example: Right ear 10% + Left ear 10% = 19% rounds to 20%.

**Bilateral factor does NOT apply to hearing loss** (unique rule for ears/eyes).

**Hearing loss often claimed with tinnitus.** File both - separate ratings combined.

---

**Migraines/Headaches - DC 8100:**

**0%:** With less frequent attacks (prostrating attacks: averaging one in 2 months over last several months)

**10%:** With characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over last several months

**30%:** With characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a week over last several months

**50%:** With very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability

**"Prostrating" means:** Requires bed rest in dark room, unable to function.

**Document frequency:** Keep headache log noting dates, severity, how long each lasts, medications taken, whether you missed work/activities.

**Migraines Often Secondary:**

Common primaries causing secondary migraines:
- Tinnitus
- Neck injuries
- TBI
- PTSD (stress-related)
- Sinusitis

---

**Common Rating Mistakes:**

**Mistake 1: Minimizing Symptoms at C&P Exam:**

"My back hurts sometimes but I manage" = 10%
"I have 8/10 pain daily, can't bend, missed 20 days work last year due to flare-ups" = 40%

Same back. Different communication.

**Mistake 2: Not Documenting Worst Symptoms:**

PTSD rated on highest symptom level. If you have panic attacks weekly but only mention "anxiety," you might get 30% instead of 50-70%.

**Mistake 3: Accepting Low Rating Without Review:**

VA gives you 10% for PTSD with symptoms clearly matching 70% criteria. You can file for increase. Don't accept low rating if your symptoms are more severe.

**Mistake 4: Not Filing Secondary Conditions:**

Tinnitus alone = 10%. Tinnitus + hearing loss + migraines secondary to tinnitus + sleep disturbance = 50%+. File all related conditions.

**Mistake 5: Ignoring Incapacitating Episodes:**

Back rated 10% on range of motion but you have 6 episodes per year requiring bed rest. That qualifies for additional 40% = 50% total. Document episodes.

**How to Research Your Condition's Rating Criteria:**

**Step 1:** Google: "38 CFR Part 4 [your condition]" or "VA rating criteria [condition]"

**Step 2:** Find your condition's diagnostic code (DC number)

**Step 3:** Read criteria for each rating level (0%, 10%, 20%, etc.)

**Step 4:** Compare your actual symptoms to criteria

**Step 5:** Document symptoms matching higher rating levels before C&P exam

**Step 6:** Communicate those symptoms clearly at C&P exam

**Resources:**

- VA.gov: Schedule for Rating Disabilities
- Benefit.va.gov/WARMS/bookc.asp (official rating schedule)
- Veterans service organization handbooks
- Condition-specific veteran forums (share experiences, rating strategies)

Understanding rating criteria empowers you to maximize your legitimate rating based on true symptom severity.

[SHOW NOTES]

**Description:** Understanding VA rating criteria determines disability compensation. PTSD 70% ($1,759/month) vs 30% ($524/month) = $1,235/month difference ($14,820/year) based on symptom communication. Sleep apnea with CPAP = automatic 50% ($1,075/month) currently. Tinnitus = flat 10% only ($171/month) regardless of severity. Episode covers rating criteria for most common conditions: PTSD (0-100%), TBI residuals (0-100%), sleep apnea (0-50%-100%), back conditions (range of motion + incapacitating episodes), knee instability, hearing loss, migraines. Proposed changes coming for PTSD (domain-based), tinnitus (elimination of standalone rating), and sleep apnea (CPAP effectiveness required).

**Key Points:**
- PTSD DC 9411: 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100% based on occupational/social impairment
- PTSD 30%: Occasional work decrease, intermittent inability to perform tasks, panic attacks weekly or less
- PTSD 50%: Reduced reliability/productivity, panic attacks weekly+, difficulty with relationships
- PTSD 70%: Deficiencies in MOST areas (work, family, judgment, mood), suicidal ideation, near-continuous panic, violence, hygiene neglect (MOST COMMON RATING)
- PTSD 100%: Total impairment, delusions/hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, danger to self/others, can't perform ADLs
- PTSD rated on HIGHEST symptoms (not average) - document worst days
- TBI DC 8045: Rates residuals (ongoing symptoms), not initial injury
- TBI ratings: 0%, 10%, 40%, 70%, 100% based on 10 domains (cognitive, judgment, social, orientation, motor, visual, subjective, neurobehavioral, communication, consciousness)
- TBI: Most severe domain determines overall rating (one 70% domain = 70% overall)
- TBI often causes: Headaches, sleep disorders, depression, cognitive issues, balance problems (avoid pyramiding)
- Tinnitus DC 6260: 10% only, regardless of severity, one or both ears
- No bilateral factor for tinnitus (10% max)
- Proposed tinnitus changes (after April 2025): Eliminate standalone rating if hearing loss 10%+
- Current tinnitus recipients protected ("grandfathered")
- Tinnitus most-claimed VA condition (easy to document, guaranteed 10% if service-connected)
- Sleep apnea DC 6847: 0%, 30%, 50%, 100%
- Sleep apnea 50%: Requires CPAP machine (automatic current rating)
- CPAP prescription = 50%, don't have to prove regular usage
- Proposed sleep apnea changes (not implemented): CPAP won't automatically = 50% if effective
- Can still get 50% if CPAP ineffective or can't tolerate (e.g., PTSD claustrophobia)
- Back DC 5237: Rated on range of motion + incapacitating episodes
- Back 10%: Flexion 60° or less, 20%: Flexion 30° or less, 40%: Cannot bend forward (0°)
- Incapacitating episodes add rating: 2/year (+10%), 4/year (+20%), 6/year (+40%)
- "Incapacitating" = bed rest prescribed by physician
- Stop at pain during back C&P exam (don't push through for "toughness")
- Knee DC 5260: Rated on flexion, extension, instability, arthritis
- Bilateral knee conditions get bilateral factor (extra 10% of combined)
- Hearing loss DC 6100: Based on audiogram decibel loss, separate ratings per ear
- NO bilateral factor for hearing loss (unique rule for ears/eyes)
- Migraines DC 8100: 0%, 10%, 30%, 50% based on frequency of "prostrating" attacks
- Prostrating = bed rest in dark room, unable to function
- Document frequency with headache log (dates, severity, duration, missed work)
- Migraines often secondary to tinnitus, neck injuries, TBI, PTSD, sinusitis
- Example: Tinnitus 10% + hearing loss 10% + migraines secondary 30% + sleep disturbance 10% = 50% combined
- Communication matters: "Hurts sometimes" = 10%, "8/10 pain daily, missed 20 work days" = 40%
- File all secondary conditions together (same effective date = more backpay)
- Research your condition: Google "38 CFR Part 4 [condition]" for official criteria
- Compare symptoms to higher rating criteria before C&P exam
