[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** Sixty percent plus twenty percent equals seventy percent, not eighty. VA math doesn't work like regular math. Understanding combined ratings difference between sixty percent and seventy percent - two hundred dollars monthly, sixty-seven thousand dollars over twenty years. Bilateral factor adds ten percent bonus. Pyramiding mistakes cost veterans thousands. Here's how it actually works.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Why VA Math Is Different:**

Regular math: 60% + 20% = 80%
VA math: 60% + 20% = 67% (rounds to 70%)

Why? VA doesn't consider you fully able-bodied when rating second condition. First disability already reduced your functioning. Second disability affects what's left.

**The "Efficiency" Concept:**

VA assumes you start at 100% efficient (fully able-bodied). Each disability reduces your remaining efficiency, not your total efficiency.

**Example:**
- Start: 100% efficient
- First disability rated 60%: You're now 40% efficient
- Second disability rated 30%: Takes 30% of your remaining 40% = 12% additional reduction
- Math: 40% minus (40% × 0.30) = 40% - 12% = 28% remaining efficiency
- You're 72% disabled (100% - 28%)
- VA rounds to nearest 10% = 70% final rating

**This is why multiple small disabilities don't add up fast.** Each subsequent rating takes percentage of smaller and smaller remaining efficiency.

**The Combined Ratings Table:**

VA provides official Combined Ratings Table (38 CFR § 4.25). Table shows how two ratings combine. Available online - Google "VA combined ratings table" or use VA calculator at va.gov.

**How to Use the Table:**

1. List all your disability ratings highest to lowest
2. Find highest rating in left column
3. Find next highest rating in top row
4. Number where they intersect = your combined rating
5. Repeat for each additional disability (use new combined rating as starting point)
6. Round final number to nearest 10%

**Example Using Table:**

Disabilities: 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%

Step 1: Combine 50% + 30%
- Find 50 in left column
- Find 30 in top row
- Intersection = 65% combined

Step 2: Combine 65% + 20%
- Find 65 in left column (this is your previous combined rating)
- Find 20 in top row
- Intersection = 72% combined

Step 3: Combine 72% + 10%
- Find 72 in left column
- Find 10 in top row
- Intersection = 75% combined

Step 4: Round to nearest 10% = 80% final rating

**Monthly Pay Difference:**
70% = $1,759.19/month
80% = $2,044.89/month
Difference = $285.70/month = $3,428/year = $68,568 over 20 years

Understanding VA math worth tens of thousands over lifetime.

**The Rounding Rules:**

VA rounds to nearest 10% for payment purposes. Ratings end in 5 or higher round up. Below 5 round down.

**Examples:**
- 64.5% rounds to 60% (pays at 60% rate = $1,361.88/month)
- 65% rounds to 70% (pays at 70% rate = $1,759.19/month)
- 74.9% rounds to 70% (pays at 70% rate = $1,759.19/month)
- 75% rounds to 80% (pays at 80% rate = $2,044.89/month)

**Half a percent matters.** 74% vs 75% = $285/month difference = $3,420/year.

**Strategic Implication:** If combined rating 64% (rounds to 60%), getting one more small condition rated even at 10% could push you to 67-68% (rounds to 70%). Worth filing for that nagging condition you've been ignoring.

**Common VA Math Examples:**

**Example 1 - Two Conditions:**
40% back disability + 20% knee disability
- Combine: 40 + 20 = 52%
- Rounds to: 50%
- Monthly pay: $1,075.16

**Example 2 - Three Conditions:**
30% PTSD + 20% tinnitus + 10% shoulder
- Combine 30 + 20 = 44%
- Combine 44 + 10 = 48%
- Rounds to: 50%
- Monthly pay: $1,075.16

**Example 3 - Four Conditions:**
50% back + 30% knee + 20% shoulder + 20% PTSD
- Combine 50 + 30 = 65%
- Combine 65 + 20 = 72%
- Combine 72 + 20 = 78%
- Rounds to: 80%
- Monthly pay: $2,044.89

**Example 4 - Many Small Conditions:**
20% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10%
- Combine 20 + 10 = 28%
- Combine 28 + 10 = 35%
- Combine 35 + 10 = 42%
- Combine 42 + 10 = 48%
- Combine 48 + 10 = 53%
- Rounds to: 50%
- Monthly pay: $1,075.16

**Notice:** Six conditions (20% + 50% in 10% conditions) only equals 50% combined. Diminishing returns.

**The Bilateral Factor - Extra 10% Bonus:**

When you have disabilities affecting BOTH sides of paired body parts (both arms, both legs, paired skeletal muscles), VA applies "bilateral factor" - adds extra 10% before final calculation.

**What Qualifies for Bilateral Factor:**
- Both arms (left and right)
- Both legs (left and right)
- Paired skeletal muscles

**What Doesn't Qualify:**
- Eyes (separate rating system)
- Ears (separate rating system)
- Single conditions affecting midline (back, neck, spine)

**Important:** Conditions don't have to be the same. Right knee arthritis + left ankle injury = bilateral factor applies. Even if one side rated 0% (non-compensable), still qualifies for bilateral factor.

**How Bilateral Factor Works:**

Step 1: Combine your bilateral disabilities using combined ratings table
Step 2: Add 10% of that combined number (NOT 10 percentage points - 10% of the number)
Step 3: Use that new number to combine with non-bilateral disabilities
Step 4: Round final number to nearest 10%

**Example - Bilateral Factor:**

Disabilities:
- Right knee: 20%
- Left knee: 10%
- Back: 40%
- PTSD: 30%

**Step 1 - Combine bilateral conditions:**
Right knee 20% + Left knee 10% = 28%

**Step 2 - Apply bilateral factor:**
10% of 28 = 2.8
28 + 2.8 = 30.8%

**Step 3 - Combine with non-bilateral conditions:**
30.8% (knees with bilateral) + 40% (back) = 60%
60% + 30% (PTSD) = 72%

**Step 4 - Round:**
72% rounds to 70%

**If no bilateral factor applied:**
Combine 20 + 10 + 40 + 30 = 68%
Rounds to 70%

In this example, bilateral factor didn't change final rating but got you closer to 70% threshold. In edge cases, bilateral factor pushes you over rounding threshold.

**Example Where Bilateral Factor Changes Final Rating:**

Disabilities:
- Right foot: 30%
- Left foot: 20%
- Shoulder: 10%

**Without bilateral factor:**
30 + 20 = 44%
44 + 10 = 49%
Rounds to 50%

**With bilateral factor:**
30 + 20 = 44%
Bilateral factor: 10% of 44 = 4.4
44 + 4.4 = 48.4%
48.4 + 10 = 54%
Rounds to 50%

Same result in this case. But if shoulder was 20% instead:

**With bilateral factor:**
48.4 + 20 = 60%
Rounds to 60%

**Without bilateral factor:**
44 + 20 = 57%
Rounds to 60%

Again same. Bilateral factor most beneficial when your combined bilateral rating in range where extra few percentage points push you over rounding threshold (74% to 75+%, 64% to 65+%).

**2023 Rule Change - Most Favorable Calculation:**

Prior to 2023, VA always applied bilateral factor. New rule: VA must calculate WITH and WITHOUT bilateral factor, then give you whichever results in higher combined rating.

This protects veterans in rare cases where not applying bilateral factor to certain conditions results in higher overall rating due to pyramiding rules or rounding thresholds.

**Bottom line:** VA will automatically calculate most favorable. You don't need to request this.

**Pyramiding - What You Can't Double-Count:**

Pyramiding = rating same disability or same symptom twice under different conditions. Federal law prohibits this (38 CFR § 4.14).

**Why Prohibited:** Would overcompensate. If insomnia rated under both PTSD and TBI, you'd get paid twice for same symptom.

**Common Pyramiding Scenarios:**

**Mental Health Conditions:**

PTSD, depression, anxiety, and most mental health conditions all rated using same criteria (38 CFR § 4.130). Can't receive separate ratings for PTSD AND depression AND anxiety if symptoms overlap.

**What VA Does:** Evaluates all mental health symptoms together, assigns single mental health rating under whichever diagnostic code most favorable.

**Example:**
- You have PTSD (Diagnostic Code 9411) with depression and anxiety symptoms
- VA rates all symptoms together
- One rating: "PTSD with depression and anxiety" at 70%
- NOT: PTSD 50% + Depression 30% + Anxiety 20%

**Physical Conditions with Overlapping Symptoms:**

**Example: Back and Leg Pain**
- Herniated disc causes both back pain and radiating leg pain (radiculopathy)
- Can't rate back pain separately AND leg pain separately if same cause
- VA rates under single code capturing both (often the herniated disc rating includes radiculopathy)

**Example: Digestive Conditions**
- IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)
- If symptoms identical/overlapping, VA may rate under one code
- BUT if symptoms separate and distinct, can rate separately

**When Pyramiding Doesn't Apply:**

Sometimes VA incorrectly cites pyramiding when conditions SHOULD be rated separately.

**Example: Psoriasis + Psoriatic Arthritis**
- Psoriasis (skin condition)
- Psoriatic arthritis (joint condition)
- Separate body systems, separate manifestations
- Rating schedule specifically allows separate ratings
- VA sometimes incorrectly denies as pyramiding - appealable

**Example: Multiple Joint Conditions**
- Right knee arthritis + right knee meniscus tear + right knee instability
- If each has separate functional impact and rated under different criteria, may be separate ratings
- If all manifestations of same underlying arthritis, one rating

**The Key Rule:** VA must assign symptoms to whichever condition/combination results in HIGHEST overall combined rating most favorable to veteran.

**Strategy:** When filing claims, be aware of potential pyramiding issues but still claim all conditions. Let VA make determination. Sometimes what seems like pyramiding has exception allowing separate ratings.

**Understanding the Rating Schedule (38 CFR Part 4):**

VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities contains over 800 conditions with specific diagnostic codes (DC) and rating percentages.

**Structure:**

- **Subpart A:** General Policy in Rating
- **Subpart B:** Disability Ratings by Body System
  - Musculoskeletal system (bones, joints, muscles)
  - Mental health conditions
  - Cardiovascular system
  - Respiratory system
  - Digestive system
  - Genitourinary system
  - Gynecological conditions
  - Hemic and lymphatic systems
  - Skin conditions
  - Neurological conditions
  - Dental and oral conditions
  - Eye conditions
  - Ear conditions
  - And more...

**Each Condition Has:**

- Diagnostic Code (DC) number
- Rating percentages (typically 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%...100%)
- Specific criteria for each percentage level

**Example: Tinnitus (DC 6260)**
- One rating level: 10%
- No higher ratings available
- Every tinnitus claim either 10% or denied (no in-between)

**Example: PTSD (DC 9411)**
- Ratings: 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%
- Criteria based on occupational/social impairment
- 70% = "Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas..."

**Example: Limited Range of Motion - Knee (DC 5260/5257)**
- 0% for slight limitation
- 10% for more pronounced limitation
- 20% for marked limitation
- 30% for severe limitation with instability

Rating criteria VERY specific. Understanding what percentage level your symptoms qualify for critical to maximizing rating.

**How VA Raters Use Schedule:**

1. Review medical evidence
2. Match symptoms to diagnostic code
3. Determine which percentage level criteria your evidence meets
4. Assign rating

**If symptoms between two percentage levels:** VA supposed to give benefit of doubt and rate higher IF evidence equally balanced. Reality: Often rate lower. This is why good medical evidence critical.

**Special Ratings:**

**0% (Non-Compensable):**

Condition service-connected but not severe enough for compensation. No monthly payment BUT:
- Still counts toward combined rating (may push you over threshold when combined with other conditions)
- Eligible for VA healthcare for that condition
- Easier to file increase later if worsens
- Counts toward "length of time service-connected" for protected ratings

Worth getting 0% rating even if no immediate payment.

**Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU):**

Can't work due to service-connected conditions but don't meet 100% schedular rating? TDIU pays at 100% rate even if combined rating lower.

**Requirements:**
- One condition rated 60%+ OR
- Multiple conditions totaling 70%+ with one at 40%+
- Unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected conditions

**Example:**
- Combined rating: 70% (back 50%, PTSD 30%, knee 20%)
- Doctor states can't work due to back pain and PTSD symptoms
- File TDIU claim
- If approved: Receive $3,831.30/month (100% rate) instead of $1,759.19 (70% rate)

TDIU covered in separate episode but important to know it exists when thinking about ratings.

**Temporary vs. Permanent Ratings:**

**Temporary Ratings:**
- Assigned during treatment/recovery
- Subject to re-evaluation
- VA can schedule future exam to determine if condition improved

**Permanent Ratings:**
- Assigned when condition static and unlikely to improve
- Protected from reduction (generally after 20 years)
- No future exams for rating purposes

**Protected Ratings:**

Once you've had same rating for 20+ years (or total service-connection for 20+ years), rating becomes "protected" - very difficult for VA to reduce. Protection encourages veterans to file early even if condition not yet severe.

**Using Online Calculators:**

Manual calculation using combined ratings table works but tedious. Free online calculators available:

**VA's Official Calculator:**
- Available at va.gov
- Enter each disability rating
- Calculates combined rating automatically
- Doesn't include bilateral factor automatically (you add that separately)

**Third-Party Calculators:**
- Hill & Ponton VA calculator
- VA Claims Insider calculator
- Benefits.com VA calculator
- Many include bilateral factor option

**Use calculator to:**
- See current combined rating
- Test "what if" scenarios (what if I get 20% for this condition?)
- Determine how close you are to next threshold
- Plan which conditions to claim for maximum impact

**Strategic Rating Planning:**

**Scenario 1 - Near Threshold:**

Current rating: 64% (rounds to 60%)
Monthly pay: $1,361.88

You have undiagnosed shoulder pain from service. If doctor diagnoses and rates 10%, you'd have:
64% + 10% = 67%
Rounds to 70%
Monthly pay: $1,759.19
Increase: $397.31/month = $4,768/year

**Worth pursuing that shoulder claim.**

**Scenario 2 - Diminishing Returns:**

Current rating: 76% (rounds to 80%)
Monthly pay: $2,044.89

You have minor foot condition might rate 10%. If added:
76% + 10% = 78%
Rounds to 80%
Monthly pay: $2,044.89
Increase: $0

**Still file** (every service-connected condition matters) but understand it won't immediately change payment until you get additional conditions pushing you to 85%+ (which rounds to 90%).

**Scenario 3 - Secondary Conditions:**

Current rating: 50% (primary condition: back)
Monthly pay: $1,075.16

Back problems caused left knee pain (favoring right leg due to back). If knee rated secondary to back at 20%:
50% + 20% = 60%
Monthly pay: $1,361.88
Increase: $286.72/month = $3,441/year

**Secondary conditions critical strategy for increasing ratings.**

**Action Steps:**

**Step 1:** List all your current service-connected conditions and their ratings

**Step 2:** Use VA calculator to verify your combined rating matches what VA calculated

**Step 3:** Identify any bilateral conditions - confirm bilateral factor applied

**Step 4:** List any additional service-connected conditions you haven't claimed yet

**Step 5:** Estimate potential ratings for those conditions (based on symptom severity and rating schedule)

**Step 6:** Calculate "what if" scenarios using calculator to see impact

**Step 7:** Prioritize which additional conditions to file based on:
- Proximity to next rating threshold
- Severity of condition
- Strength of evidence available
- Secondary connections to existing conditions

**Step 8:** If near threshold (64%, 74%, 84%, 94%), aggressively pursue any additional conditions that could push you over

**Common Mistakes:**

**Mistake 1:** Assuming ratings add normally (60 + 20 = 80). Use VA math.

**Mistake 2:** Not claiming condition because "it's only 10%." That 10% might push you over threshold.

**Mistake 3:** Filing identical symptoms under multiple conditions (pyramiding). Costs you nothing but delays claim.

**Mistake 4:** Not considering secondary conditions. These often easier to connect and add significant rating increases.

**Mistake 5:** Giving up at 70% or 80% thinking you can't get higher. Pursue all legitimate conditions - 90% and 100% achievable.

**Mistake 6:** Not using bilateral factor when applicable. Make sure VA applied it.

**Mistake 7:** Not knowing your combined rating calculation. Verify VA math correct (they make mistakes).

[SHOW NOTES]

**Description:** VA disability ratings use "efficiency math" not regular addition - 60% + 20% equals 67% (rounds to 70%), not 80%. Bilateral factor adds 10% bonus when conditions affect paired body parts (both arms, both legs). Pyramiding prohibits rating same symptom twice. Episode explains Combined Ratings Table, bilateral factor calculations (2023 rule requires most favorable), pyramiding examples (mental health conditions, overlapping symptoms), and strategic rating planning for threshold amounts (64%→70%, 74%→80%). Understanding VA math worth $68,568+ over 20 years.

**Key Points:**
- VA math: 60% + 20% = 67% (rounds to 70%), not 80%
- "Efficiency" concept: Each disability reduces remaining efficiency, not total
- Example: 60% disability = 40% efficient; 30% of 40% = 12% reduction = 72% total disability
- Rounding: 64.5%-74.9% rounds to 70%, 75%-84.9% rounds to 80%
- Half percent matters: 74% vs 75% = $285/month = $3,420/year difference
- 70% vs 80% = $285.70/month = $68,568 over 20 years
- Combined Ratings Table (38 CFR § 4.25): Official VA table for combining ratings
- Combine highest to lowest rating, use table for each combination
- Six 10% conditions only = 53% combined (rounds to 50%) - diminishing returns
- Bilateral factor: Extra 10% when disabilities affect paired body parts
- Qualifies: Both arms, both legs, paired muscles (conditions don't have to match)
- Bilateral calculation: Combine bilateral disabilities → Add 10% of that number → Combine with others
- Example: 20% right knee + 10% left knee = 28%, plus 10% of 28 (2.8) = 30.8%
- 2023 rule: VA must calculate with/without bilateral and choose most favorable
- Pyramiding (38 CFR § 4.14): Prohibited - can't rate same symptom twice
- Mental health: PTSD + Depression + Anxiety = one combined rating (same criteria)
- Physical: IBS + GERD may be one rating if symptoms overlap
- Exception: Psoriasis + Psoriatic arthritis = separate (different body systems)
- VA must assign symptoms to condition giving highest overall rating
- 38 CFR Part 4: Over 800 conditions with specific diagnostic codes
- Tinnitus (DC 6260): Only one rating level (10%)
- PTSD (DC 9411): 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100% based on impairment
- 0% rating: Non-compensable but counts toward combined rating, provides VA healthcare
- TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability): Pays 100% rate if can't work
- TDIU requirements: One condition 60%+ OR multiple 70%+ with one 40%+
- Protected ratings: After 20+ years, very difficult for VA to reduce
- Strategic planning: If at 64% (pays 60%), one 10% condition = 67% (pays 70%)
- Online calculators: VA.gov, Hill & Ponton, VA Claims Insider, Benefits.com
- Verify VA math correct (VA makes calculation mistakes)
- Secondary conditions strategy: Condition caused by service-connected condition
- File all legitimate conditions even if "only 10%" - may push over threshold
