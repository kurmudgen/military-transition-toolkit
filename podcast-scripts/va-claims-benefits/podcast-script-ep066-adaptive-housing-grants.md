[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

If you have a severe service-connected disability that affects your mobility or independence, VA provides grants to help adapt your home - and these aren't loans, they're grants you never have to repay. The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant provides up to $121,812 in 2025 for veterans who need wheelchair-accessible homes. The Special Home Adaptation (SHA) grant provides up to $24,405 for veterans with other qualifying disabilities. The Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grant provides up to $6,800 for service-connected home modifications. You can use SAH or SHA grants up to 6 times throughout your lifetime - renovate your current home, then use it again when you move. The Temporary Residence Adaptation grant provides up to $49,062 for SAH-eligible veterans to adapt a family member's home where you're temporarily living. These grants work with VA home loans - you can get a VA loan to buy a home, then use an SAH grant to make it accessible. Over 18,000 veterans have used these grants since 1948. Most qualifying veterans don't know these benefits exist. I'm Jacob, Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're covering exactly what adaptive housing grants are available, who qualifies for each, what modifications they cover, and how to apply for grants that could provide over $100,000 to make your home livable. This is Veteran Transition Blueprint.

**What Are VA Adaptive Housing Grants?**

VA offers several grant programs to help veterans with severe service-connected disabilities adapt their homes to meet their needs and live more independently.

**Key distinction - grants vs. loans:** These are GRANTS, not loans. You never have to repay them. They're one-time benefits (or up to 6 uses for SAH/SHA) that VA provides to help you adapt your living space.

**The three main programs:**
1. Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) - up to $121,812 in 2025
2. Special Home Adaptation (SHA) - up to $24,405 in 2025
3. Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) - up to $6,800 for service-connected

**Why these grants exist:** Severe service-connected disabilities can make standard housing uninhabitable. A veteran who uses a wheelchair can't navigate a home with stairs and narrow doorways. A veteran with severe burns needs specialized bathroom facilities. These grants remove those barriers.

**SAH - Specially Adapted Housing Grant**

The SAH grant is the largest adaptive housing benefit, designed for veterans with the most severe mobility impairments.

**2025 amount:** Up to $121,812 (adjusted annually based on construction costs)
**2024 amount:** $117,014

**Who qualifies for SAH:** You must have a permanent and total service-connected disability that meets one of these criteria:

**Qualifying disability #1:** Loss or loss of use of both lower extremities (legs) that prevents you from moving without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.

"Loss of use" means you can't use your legs functionally, even if they're physically attached. Severe paralysis, nerve damage, or other conditions preventing mobility qualify.

**Qualifying disability #2:** Blindness in both eyes with 20/200 visual acuity or less, with concurrent loss or loss of use of one lower extremity.

You must be legally blind AND have loss of use of a leg.

**Qualifying disability #3:** Loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with residual effects of organic disease or injury that prevent natural knee action and require the use of a brace to function.

Example: Amputation of one leg plus organic condition affecting the other leg requiring permanent bracing.

**Qualifying disability #4:** Severe burn injuries that permanently impair your ability to function.

Extensive burn scarring that severely limits mobility or requires specialized accommodations.

**What SAH covers:**

**For new construction:** Grants help pay for building a specially adapted home from the ground up, designed specifically for your disability needs. This might include:
- Wider doorways for wheelchair access (36" minimum)
- Zero-step entries
- Roll-in showers
- Lower countertops and cabinets
- Accessible bathrooms
- Specialized flooring
- Ramps and accessible pathways
- Turning radius space for wheelchairs throughout home

**For existing home modifications:** Purchase an existing home and use grant funds to adapt it, or adapt a home you already own. Modifications might include:
- Installing wheelchair ramps
- Widening doorways
- Renovating bathrooms for wheelchair access
- Lowering counters and switches
- Installing specialized equipment
- Improving accessibility throughout

**For purchasing adapted homes:** Buy a home that's already specially adapted. If it meets your needs without modifications, the grant helps with the purchase price.

**How many times can you use SAH:** Up to 6 times throughout your lifetime. Grant amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. If you used $100,000 of your grant in 2020, you don't lose the ability to use updated amounts later. You get 6 separate grants at whatever the current amount is.

**Example usage:** Use SAH grant to adapt home in 2025. Sell that home in 2030 and move to new location. Use SAH grant again to adapt new home. You can do this 6 times total.

**SHA - Special Home Adaptation Grant**

The SHA grant is for veterans with different types of qualifying disabilities - still serious, but not as mobility-limiting as SAH criteria.

**2025 amount:** Up to $24,405
**2024 amount:** $22,444

**Who qualifies for SHA:** You must have a permanent and total service-connected disability meeting one of these criteria:

**Qualifying disability #1:** Blindness in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less.

This is more severe blindness than SAH requirement, but without the concurrent leg loss requirement.

**Qualifying disability #2:** Loss or loss of use of both hands.

Can't functionally use your hands due to amputation, paralysis, or other service-connected condition.

**Qualifying disability #3:** Severe respiratory condition that requires use of oxygen therapy on a full-time basis.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), burn pit exposure effects, or other service-connected respiratory conditions requiring constant oxygen.

**Qualifying disability #4:** Certain severe burn injuries.

Burn injuries that affect your ability to function but may not require full wheelchair adaptation.

**What SHA covers:**

SHA modifications are similar to SAH but typically less extensive:
- Bathroom modifications for accessibility
- Kitchen adaptations (lower counters, accessible sinks)
- Doorway modifications
- Specialized equipment installation
- Entrance and exit accessibility
- Respiratory equipment accommodation spaces
- Grab bars, specialized fixtures

**SHA can also be used 6 times throughout your lifetime**, with amounts adjusted annually.

**Comparison: SAH vs. SHA**

SAH is for more severe mobility impairments ($121,812 maximum). SHA is for other serious disabilities ($24,405 maximum). Both allow 6 lifetime uses. Both can be used for new construction, modifications, or purchasing adapted homes.

**The key: Know which one you qualify for and apply for the correct grant.**

**TRA - Temporary Residence Adaptation Grant**

The TRA grant helps veterans who are temporarily living with family members and need to adapt the family member's home.

**2025 amounts:**
- Up to $49,062 for SAH-eligible veterans
- Up to $8,760 for SHA-eligible veterans

**Who qualifies:** You must qualify for either SAH or SHA grants AND be temporarily residing in a family member's home.

**Family member definition:** Related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Grandparents, parents, siblings, children, aunts, uncles, cousins.

**What TRA covers:** Temporary modifications to the family member's home to accommodate your needs:
- Ramps (can be temporary or permanent)
- Bathroom modifications
- Doorway widening
- Equipment installation
- Other accessibility improvements

**Important TRA rules:**

**TRA does not count against your SAH/SHA dollar limits.** If you use $40,000 in TRA funds, you still have your full $121,812 SAH grant available for your permanent residence later.

**TRA does count as one of your 6 uses.** You get 6 total uses of SAH or SHA - TRA uses one of those 6.

**You cannot use TRA if you're renting from someone who's not a family member.** Must be a family member's home.

**Common TRA scenario:** Veteran with severe disability returns from deployment. Temporarily lives with parents while recovering and finding permanent housing. Uses TRA to make parents' home wheelchair-accessible. Later buys own home and uses SAH grant to adapt it. Both grants used, only one counted against the 6 uses.

**HISA - Home Improvements and Structural Alterations Grant**

HISA is a separate, smaller grant for medically necessary home modifications.

**Grant amounts (lifetime limits):**
- Up to $6,800 for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 50% or higher
- Up to $2,000 for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated below 50% OR non-service-connected disabilities

**Who qualifies:** Any veteran or service member enrolled in VA healthcare who needs medically necessary home modifications. You don't need the severe disabilities required for SAH/SHA.

**What HISA covers:**

**Entrance/exit modifications:** Ramps, lifts, or modifications allowing you to enter and exit your home.

**Bathroom accessibility:** Roll-in showers, grab bars, accessible toilets, lower sinks.

**Kitchen modifications:** Lower counters and sinks for wheelchair users.

**Essential medical equipment installation:** Modifications needed to install home medical equipment prescribed by VA.

**Electrical/plumbing modifications:** Changes needed to accommodate medical equipment.

**What HISA does NOT cover:**
- Exterior decking or porches (unless medically necessary for access)
- Hot tubs, spas, Jacuzzis
- Home security systems
- Portable equipment (portable ramps, stair glides)
- Routine maintenance (roof replacement, new furnace, etc.)

**How to apply for HISA:**

Requires a VA physician's prescription. Your VA doctor must prescribe the home modification as medically necessary. Complete VA Form 10-0103 (Veterans Application for Assistance in Acquiring Home Improvement and Structural Alterations). Submit both to your local VA medical center's Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service.

**HISA processing:** Much faster than SAH/SHA. Typically approved within weeks if you have the proper prescription.

**HISA is a lifetime benefit limit:** Once you use your $6,800, it's gone for life. Use it wisely for your most essential modifications.

**How to Apply for SAH/SHA/TRA Grants**

Let's walk through the application process for adaptive housing grants.

**Step One - Confirm eligibility:**

Review the qualifying disabilities for SAH or SHA. Determine which grant you qualify for based on your service-connected disabilities. You must have ratings decisions showing your qualifying disabilities.

**Step Two - Gather required documents:**

- DD-214 or proof of military service
- VA rating decisions showing qualifying service-connected disabilities
- If applying for modifications: Documentation of the home you own or plan to buy
- If applying for new construction: Land ownership or purchase agreement
- If applying for TRA: Proof the home belongs to a family member

**Step Three - Complete VA Form 26-4555:**

"Application in Acquiring Specially Adapted Housing or Special Home Adaptation Grant"

The form asks for:
- Your qualifying disability information
- What you plan to do (build, buy, modify)
- Property information
- Cost estimates for modifications or purchase
- Your financial information

**Step Four - Obtain cost estimates:**

If modifying a home, get estimates from contractors for the adaptive work. If building a home, get construction estimates. If purchasing, provide purchase agreement.

VA needs to know the modification costs will be within grant limits.

**Step Five - Submit your application:**

Mail to your VA Regional Loan Center, OR submit online through VA.gov (if available in your region), OR work with a VSO who can help submit.

**Step Six - VA reviews application:**

VA reviews your eligibility, verifies your qualifying disabilities, examines your modification plans, and determines grant amount you're entitled to.

VA may conduct a home inspection or architectural review.

**Step Seven - Grant approval:**

Once approved, VA authorizes the grant amount. You can begin construction or modifications. VA typically pays contractors directly or reimburses you upon completion.

**Processing time:** 2-4 months on average, sometimes longer for complex modifications or new construction.

**Combining Grants with VA Home Loans**

Here's a powerful combination most veterans don't know about: You can use a VA home loan to purchase a home, then use SAH or SHA grants to make it accessible.

**The strategy:**
1. Find a home in your price range
2. Use VA home loan (zero down payment) to purchase it
3. Use SAH grant (up to $121,812) to modify it for accessibility
4. You own an adapted home with minimal money out of pocket

**Example:** $350,000 home purchased with VA loan, zero down. Use $80,000 of SAH grant to add wheelchair accessibility (ramps, wider doors, accessible bathroom, modified kitchen). Total out-of-pocket: Maybe $10,000 for miscellaneous costs. You own a fully accessible $430,000 home.

**VA home loans for adapted homes:** Some builders specialize in universally designed or wheelchair-accessible homes. You can use a VA loan to buy these homes, and if they need additional modifications, use your grant.

**Real Examples of Grant Use**

**Example 1 - SAH new construction:**

Veteran with bilateral leg amputations. Qualifies for SAH. Owns land. Uses $121,812 SAH grant as part of construction costs for building a completely accessible 2,000 sq ft home. Home designed from scratch with:
- Zero-step entry
- 36" doorways throughout
- Roll-in shower
- Lower counters and cabinets
- Accessible laundry
- Turning radius space in all rooms

Total construction cost: $300,000. SAH grant covers $121,812. Veteran finances remaining $178,188 with VA home loan or other financing.

**Example 2 - SHA modification:**

Veteran with service-connected COPD requiring full-time oxygen. Qualifies for SHA. Owns a 1960s home with accessibility issues. Uses $24,405 SHA grant to:
- Widen doorways for easier oxygen tank movement
- Modify bathroom for oxygen equipment storage
- Improve ventilation systems
- Create dedicated medical equipment space
- Install grab bars and safety features

Modifications allow veteran to live independently at home instead of requiring assisted living.

**Example 3 - TRA then SAH:**

Veteran with spinal cord injury from combat. Initially lives with parents during recovery. Uses TRA grant ($49,062) to make parents' home wheelchair-accessible. Two years later, purchases own home. Uses SAH grant ($121,812) to make new home fully accessible. Used two grants but only one counted against 6-use limit.

**Example 4 - HISA small modifications:**

Veteran rated 60% for back and knee conditions. Owns home with bathtub only. VA doctor prescribes roll-in shower as medically necessary for safety. Uses HISA grant ($6,800) to convert tub to accessible shower with grab bars and seat. Improves safety and independence.

**Common Questions About Adaptive Housing Grants**

**Q: Can I use SAH/SHA grants to adapt a home I'm buying?**

A: Yes. You can buy a home and immediately use grant funds to modify it before you move in.

**Q: What if my modifications cost more than the grant amount?**

A: You pay the difference. Grants cover up to the maximum amount; you're responsible for costs beyond that.

**Q: Can I use the grant for a home I don't own?**

A: Generally no, except for TRA at a family member's home. You must own the property or be in the process of buying it.

**Q: What if I used my grant years ago and the amount was lower?**

A: You can use the grant again (up to 6 times) at current amounts. Your previous use doesn't reduce future grant amounts - each use is at the then-current maximum.

**Q: Do I have to use the entire grant at once?**

A: No. If your modifications cost $60,000 and your SAH grant is $121,812, you use $60,000. The remaining balance stays available for future use within the same grant use.

**Q: How long do I have to use the grant after approval?**

A: Typically 12-18 months from approval date. Contact VA if you need an extension.

**Description:**
VA adaptive housing grants provide up to $121,812 (SAH), $24,405 (SHA), or $6,800 (HISA) for veterans with severe service-connected disabilities to adapt homes for accessibility - grants never require repayment. Host Jacob (Navy E6, medical retirement) explains eligibility: SAH for wheelchair users/blind with leg loss ($121,812 in 2025), SHA for blind/loss of use of hands/severe respiratory conditions ($24,405), HISA for medically necessary home modifications ($6,800 for 50%+ rated). Can use SAH/SHA up to 6 times lifetime. TRA grant provides additional funds for temporary family residence adaptations. Grants cover wheelchair ramps, wider doorways, roll-in showers, accessible kitchens, specialized equipment. Apply using VA Form 26-4555; can combine with VA home loans.
