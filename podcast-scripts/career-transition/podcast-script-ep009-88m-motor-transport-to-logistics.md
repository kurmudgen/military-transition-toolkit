[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

You're an 88 Mike. You've driven everything from HMMWVs to heavy trucks across every terrain imaginable. You've managed convoys, coordinated movements, and transported critical cargo. And civilian companies need exactly those skills. [pause] We're talking truck driving jobs that pay seventy to ninety thousand, logistics positions at eighty to one hundred thousand, and management roles over six figures.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're talking to Army Motor Transport Operators - 88 Mikes. Whether you want to drive trucks, manage logistics operations, or move into supply chain management, your military experience opens doors to careers that pay well and have excellent job security.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering how to get your Class A CDL using your military experience, which trucking companies pay the most and actively hire veterans, logistics careers beyond driving that pay eighty to one hundred thousand plus, and your complete transition timeline. If you're 88M and getting out, this is your roadmap. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 22-24 minutes]

**Segment 1: Your 88M Experience and Why It's Valuable (4 minutes)**

As an 88M, you've been doing more than just driving trucks. Let's break down what you actually bring to civilian employers.

You've operated wheeled vehicles - LMTVs, HEMTTs, PLS systems, maybe even wreckers and heavy equipment transporters. You've driven in convoys, you've navigated difficult terrain, you've performed operator-level maintenance, and you've managed vehicle inspections and safety protocols.

If you've deployed, you've done convoy operations in hostile environments. You've coordinated with other vehicles, maintained communication, and made real-time decisions under pressure.

That's professional driving experience. That's logistics coordination. That's safety management. All of these skills translate directly to civilian transportation and logistics careers.

Here's why civilian companies value 88Ms:

**First** - you have discipline and safety focus. You've been trained to follow procedures, conduct pre-trip inspections, and operate vehicles safely. Commercial trucking companies lose millions of dollars from accidents. They need drivers who take safety seriously.

**Second** - you can handle stress and difficult conditions. You've driven in weather, traffic, and challenging environments. Civilian driving has its challenges - traffic, tight delivery schedules, difficult loading docks - but compared to convoy operations in a combat zone, it's manageable.

**Third** - you understand vehicle maintenance. You've done PM-CS, you've identified mechanical issues, you've kept vehicles operational. Companies value drivers who can spot problems before they become breakdowns.

**Fourth** - you have logistics coordination experience. If you've been a convoy commander or vehicle commander, you've coordinated movements, managed timelines, and ensured mission success. That's logistics management.

Now let's talk salary reality. As an 88M on active duty, if you're an E4 or E5, you're making around $45,000 to $55,000 total compensation.

Civilian truck drivers with a Class A CDL make $55,000 to $90,000+ depending on the type of driving and company. Specialized drivers - hazmat, tanker, oversized load - can make even more. Owner-operators who own their own trucks can make $100,000 to $200,000+, though that comes with business ownership responsibilities.

Logistics coordinators and transportation managers make $60,000 to $100,000+. Supply chain managers can make $90,000 to $140,000+.

So there's significant earning potential in this field.

**Segment 2: Getting Your Class A CDL - The Military Skills Test Waiver (5 minutes)**

This is critical. Most civilian trucking jobs require a Commercial Driver's License - that's CDL, C-D-L. The Class A CDL is the highest level and allows you to drive the largest commercial vehicles.

Here's the good news: [emphasis: "Many states have a Military Skills Test Waiver program that lets 88Ms skip the driving skills test and go straight to the written knowledge test."]

Let me explain how this works.

Normally, getting a Class A CDL requires:
1. Passing written knowledge tests
2. Getting a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP)
3. Attending a truck driving school or getting training
4. Passing a pre-trip inspection test
5. Passing a skills test (backing, parking, maneuvering)
6. Passing a road test

This process costs $3,000 to $7,000 for truck driving school and takes 3-8 weeks.

With the Military Skills Test Waiver, many states let you skip steps 2-6. You take the written tests, and if you pass, you get your CDL. That's it.

Requirements vary by state, but typically you need:
- An active duty military driver's license or military driving record
- Documentation showing you operated commercial motor vehicles in the military
- An honorable discharge or current active duty status
- To be within 12 months of separation or within 12 months after separation

Each state has different rules. Some states are very veteran-friendly and make this easy. Others have more restrictive programs.

**States with strong Military CDL Waiver programs:**
- Texas
- Georgia
- North Carolina
- Virginia
- Washington
- Oklahoma
- Many others - check your state's DMV website

**The process typically involves:**

1. Get your military driving records - your DA Form 348 (Equipment Operator's Qualification Record) or equivalent documentation showing you drove military vehicles

2. Get a letter from your unit certifying your driving experience - this should specify what vehicles you operated and for how long

3. Go to your state DMV with these documents

4. Pass the written CDL knowledge tests - there are three tests: General Knowledge, Air Brakes, and Combination Vehicles. You study for these using the state CDL manual (free download).

5. If your state offers the skills test waiver and you qualify, they issue your Class A CDL

6. Total cost: Usually $50-$100 for the license and testing fees

So instead of spending $5,000 and 6 weeks in truck driving school, you spend $100 and a few days studying for written tests.

This is a huge advantage for 88Ms.

**Important**: Even if your state doesn't offer a complete waiver, they might offer a partial waiver or give you credit toward the training requirement. It's worth checking.

Also, some trucking companies will pay for your CDL training if you commit to working for them for a certain period (usually 1-2 years). So even if you don't qualify for a waiver, you might not have to pay out of pocket.

**Segment 3: Trucking Career Paths and What They Pay (6 minutes)**

Let me break down the different types of truck driving and what they pay.

**Over-the-Road (OTR) Trucking**

This is long-haul trucking. You're driving across multiple states, often gone for weeks at a time. You sleep in your truck, you cover thousands of miles per week.

Salary: $55,000 to $80,000+ per year for company drivers. Pay is usually per mile - $0.40 to $0.60 per mile is common, though experienced drivers at good companies can make $0.60 to $0.70 per mile.

If you drive 2,500 miles per week at $0.50 per mile, that's $1,250 per week or $65,000 per year.

Advantages: Higher pay than local routes, see different parts of the country, usually newer trucks.

Disadvantages: You're away from home for extended periods. This is hard on families. Not ideal if you have young kids or want to be home regularly.

**Regional Trucking**

This is similar to OTR but you're driving within a region - maybe a 500-mile radius. You might be home on weekends or every few nights.

Salary: $50,000 to $70,000 per year. Slightly less than OTR but better work-life balance.

**Local Trucking / Home Daily**

You drive locally and you're home every night. This might be delivering to distribution centers, retail stores, construction sites.

Salary: $45,000 to $65,000 per year, sometimes more depending on the route and company.

Advantages: Home every night, predictable schedule, less wear and tear on your body from living in a truck.

Disadvantages: Usually lower pay than OTR, might involve more physical work (loading/unloading).

**Specialized Trucking**

This is where the money gets better. Specialized loads require additional endorsements and skills, so they pay more.

**Hazmat (Hazardous Materials)**: Requires Hazmat endorsement on your CDL. Pay is typically $5,000 to $15,000 more per year than regular freight. Drivers with Hazmat can make $70,000 to $90,000+.

**Tanker**: Hauling liquids in tanker trucks. Requires Tanker endorsement. Similar pay to Hazmat. Often combined with Hazmat for fuel delivery.

**Oversized/Heavy Haul**: Transporting large equipment, machinery, modular homes. This requires special permits and skills. Pay can be $80,000 to $100,000+ for experienced drivers.

**Car Haulers**: Transporting vehicles. This requires careful loading and securing. Pay is $65,000 to $85,000+.

**LTL (Less Than Truckload) Linehaul Drivers**: Companies like Old Dominion, XPO Logistics, FedEx Freight. These jobs often pay hourly plus benefits. Drivers can make $70,000 to $100,000+ per year.

**Owner-Operators**

This is when you own your own truck and contract with companies to haul freight.

Potential earnings: $100,000 to $200,000+ per year

But be aware - you have to buy the truck ($150,000 to $180,000 for a new truck, $30,000 to $100,000 for a used one), you pay for fuel, maintenance, insurance, and all operating costs.

Owner-operators can make great money, but it's running a business. You have to manage expenses carefully or you can end up making less than company drivers after expenses.

I don't recommend this as a first step out of the military. Work as a company driver for 2-3 years, learn the business, save money, then consider buying your own truck if you want.

**Companies actively hiring veteran truck drivers:**

- **Schneider National** - has military apprenticeship program, veteran-friendly
- **J.B. Hunt** - actively recruits veterans
- **Swift Transportation** - has veteran hiring program
- **Werner Enterprises** - veteran hiring initiatives
- **Roehl Transport** - military apprenticeship program
- **Prime Inc.** - pays for CDL training if you don't have it
- **Old Dominion Freight (LTL)** - excellent pay and benefits, very competitive
- **XPO Logistics** - good pay, union jobs in some locations
- **FedEx Freight** - LTL carrier, strong benefits
- **UPS** - union jobs, excellent benefits, but competitive to get in

All of these companies need drivers right now. The trucking industry has a driver shortage, so if you have a Class A CDL and a clean driving record, you can get hired.

**Segment 4: Beyond Driving - Logistics and Supply Chain Careers (4-5 minutes)**

Driving is the most direct path for 88Ms, but it's not the only path. Let's talk about logistics and supply chain careers.

**Transportation Coordinator / Logistics Coordinator**

This is managing the movement of freight - coordinating shipments, working with carriers, tracking deliveries, solving problems when shipments are delayed.

Salary: $45,000 to $70,000 depending on company and location.

Your 88M experience with convoy coordination and movement management translates directly to this work.

Companies hiring: All major logistics companies - DHL, DB Schenker, C.H. Robinson, XPO Logistics, J.B. Hunt (logistics division), plus manufacturing companies and retailers.

**Warehouse Manager / Distribution Center Manager**

Managing warehouse operations - receiving, storage, shipping, inventory control, managing staff.

Salary: $55,000 to $85,000 for warehouse managers, $70,000 to $100,000+ for distribution center managers.

If you were a motor sergeant or convoy commander managing multiple vehicles and personnel, you have management experience that applies here.

**Supply Chain Analyst**

Analyzing supply chain data, optimizing routes and costs, forecasting demand, improving efficiency.

Salary: $60,000 to $90,000.

This typically requires a bachelor's degree or significant experience. You can use your GI Bill to get a degree in supply chain management or logistics and position yourself for these roles.

**Fleet Manager**

Managing a company's vehicle fleet - scheduling maintenance, tracking vehicles, ensuring compliance, managing drivers.

Salary: $60,000 to $90,000.

Your experience maintaining military vehicles and managing transportation assets is directly applicable.

**Dispatcher**

Coordinating drivers, assigning loads, managing routes, solving problems.

Salary: $40,000 to $60,000.

This is often a stepping stone to higher-level logistics roles.

**Segment 5: Your Transition Timeline and Action Plan (3-4 minutes)**

Here's your step-by-step plan:

**12 months before separation:**

Research your state's Military CDL Waiver program. Go to your state DMV website and search for "military CDL waiver" or "troops to truckers."

Get your military driving records - DA Form 348 and any other documentation of your driving experience.

Get a letter from your unit certifying your experience.

Download your state's CDL manual and start studying for the written tests.

**6-9 months before separation:**

Take the CDL written knowledge tests. There are three main tests - General Knowledge, Air Brakes, and Combination Vehicles. You can also study for endorsements - Hazmat, Tanker, Doubles/Triples.

If you pass and qualify for the waiver, get your Class A CDL.

If you don't qualify for a waiver, research CDL training options. Look for veteran-friendly programs or companies that will pay for your training.

**3-6 months before separation:**

Apply to SkillBridge programs with trucking or logistics companies if available.

Start applying to trucking jobs or logistics positions.

Research different types of trucking to decide what works for your lifestyle - OTR, regional, local, specialized.

**1-2 months before separation:**

Finalize job offers. Compare pay, benefits, home time, equipment.

For trucking jobs, ask about:
- Pay per mile or hourly pay
- Average weekly miles
- Home time policies
- Equipment (what trucks they run)
- Benefits (health insurance, retirement)

**Post-separation:**

If you got hired by a trucking company, you'll likely go through orientation (1-2 weeks) and then over-the-road training with a trainer (2-8 weeks) before you drive solo.

If you're starting in logistics, you'll go through normal onboarding.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap.

88M Motor Transport Operators have direct pathways to civilian trucking and logistics careers. Truck drivers with Class A CDL make $55K to $90K+, specialized drivers make $70K to $100K+, and logistics management positions pay $60K to $100K+.

Many states offer Military CDL Waiver programs that let you get your Class A CDL by passing written tests without attending truck driving school. This saves you $5,000 and weeks of training.

Trucking options include Over-the-Road ($55K-$80K+), regional, local/home daily, and specialized (Hazmat, tanker, heavy haul). Companies actively hiring veterans include Schneider, J.B. Hunt, Swift, Werner, and LTL carriers like Old Dominion and FedEx Freight.

Beyond driving, logistics coordinator, warehouse manager, fleet manager, and supply chain analyst roles offer $50K to $100K+ salaries.
