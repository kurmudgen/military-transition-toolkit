**Certifications:** Airport security badges required (SIDA). Some positions want airfield driving permits. CDL helpful for some equipment. No expensive certifications needed - experience valued.

**Work Reality:** Shift work (24/7 operations). Outside in all weather. Physical work. But aviation industry stable, union jobs common, flight benefits at airlines.

**Timeline:**

12 months out: Research airlines hiring in target cities (hubs have most opportunities). Understand ramp operations requirements.

6-9 months out: Apply to airline ground operations programs. Many have veteran-specific recruiting. Update resume highlighting safety leadership.

3-6 months out: Interview emphasizing flight deck experience, safety focus, ability to work under pressure. Start around separation or post-terminal leave.

**Growth Path:** Start ramp agent → supervisor (1-2 years, $55K-$70K) → coordinator/manager (3-5 years, $70K-$95K) → station manager (5-10 years, $85K-$110K+).
