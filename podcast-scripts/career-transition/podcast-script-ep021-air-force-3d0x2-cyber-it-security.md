**Your 3D Skills:** Network administration, server management, cybersecurity operations, system configuration, troubleshooting, security monitoring. Enterprise IT experience.

**Career Paths:**

**Systems Administrator:** Windows/Linux servers, Active Directory, email systems. $60K-$95K. Direct translation of Air Force work.

**Network Administrator/Engineer:** Routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs. $65K-$110K. Your AF network experience applies.

**Cybersecurity Analyst:** Security monitoring, threat analysis, incident response. $75K-$120K. High demand, good growth.

**Cloud Engineer:** AWS/Azure infrastructure. $90K-$150K+. Hot career path. AF cloud migration experience helps.

**Security Engineer:** Design/implement security solutions. $90K-$130K+. Technical security role.

**DevOps Engineer:** Automation, CI/CD pipelines. $95K-$140K. Advanced path requiring programming.

**Certifications (mirrors Episode 7 - 25B):**

Security+ (DoD 8570 required): $392
CCNA (networking): $300
AWS Solutions Architect: $150
Microsoft Azure Administrator: $165
CISSP (advanced, 5yr experience): $749

**Get Security+ while still in. Add cloud or networking cert first civilian year. CISSP for senior roles.**

**Companies:** Same as 25B - Amazon, Microsoft, Google (cloud), defense contractors (Booz Allen, CACI, Leidos), banks (JPMorgan, Capital One), all tech companies.

**Clearance Value:** If you have TS clearance from cyber work, worth $20K-$30K premium for defense contractor positions.

**Air Force Advantage:** AF IT training strong reputation. Systems well-documented compared to other services. Your technical knowledge solid foundation.

**Timeline:** 12mo Security+ if not done, start next cert, 6-9mo complete cert and apply jobs, 3-6mo interview emphasizing technical skills, separation start $70K-$90K role.

**Career Progression:** Entry sys admin $70K → add certs/experience → engineer $85K-$105K (3-5yr) → senior/architect $120K-$150K+ (5-10yr).
