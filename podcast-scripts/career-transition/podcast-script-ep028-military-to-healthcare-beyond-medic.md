**Cold Open:** Not a medic but interested in healthcare? Multiple paths available. Medical device sales at ninety thousand, respiratory therapist at eighty thousand, radiology tech at seventy-seven thousand. Your military skills transfer - no medical MOS required.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Healthcare Beyond Clinical Roles:**

Healthcare industry massive - not just doctors and nurses. Administrative, technical, sales, operations roles need your military skills. HCA Healthcare hired 65,000 veterans since 2012. Northwell Health, VA, Humana all actively recruiting veterans. They want leadership, reliability, ability to work under pressure. You have that.

**High-Pay Non-Clinical Paths:**

**Medical Device Sales:** Selling surgical equipment, imaging systems, hospital technology to healthcare facilities. Entry level $70K-$80K base. Total compensation $90K-$100K with commissions. Experienced reps $90K-$183K. Your presentation skills, relationship building, understanding customer needs transfer. Companies value veterans - discipline, follow-through, understanding of medical equipment from military healthcare facilities. Bachelor's degree preferred but not always required. Training provided on products.

**Healthcare Administration:** Hospital operations, department management, project coordination. $50K-$85K depending on role and level. Your logistics, planning, personnel management experience applies. Roles include: department coordinator, operations manager, project manager, facility administrator. Veterans make up significant portion of VA administration (obvious fit but private hospitals hiring too).

**Patient Advocate:** Help patients navigate healthcare system, resolve issues, coordinate care. $56K average. Your service mentality, problem-solving, patience, communication skills perfect fit. Satisfying work helping people. VA and private hospitals both hire.

**Healthcare IT:** Electronic health records, medical equipment IT systems, healthcare technology. $65K-$95K. If you have any IT background (even basic), healthcare IT growing rapidly. Combines tech skills with healthcare knowledge.

**Technical Healthcare Paths (Require Training):**

These require associate degree or certificate program (typically 2 years), but provide solid middle-class career with growth potential:

**Respiratory Therapist:** Manage ventilators, breathing treatments, pulmonary function tests. $80,450 median (BLS 2024). Range $61,900-$108,820. Two-year associate degree required. Clinical training included. High demand, aging population needs respiratory care. Can work hospitals, home health, sleep labs.

**Radiology Technologist:** Operate X-ray, CT, MRI machines. $77,660 median (BLS 2024). MRI techs $88,180. Range $52,360-$106,990. Two-year program, ARRT certification required. VA Minneapolis has radiology school for veterans. Your attention to detail, following safety protocols, remaining calm with patients transfers from military.

**Surgical Technologist:** Assist in operating room - prepare instruments, maintain sterile field, assist surgeons. $62,830 median (BLS 2024). Range $43,290-$90,700. Certificate or associate degree (12-24 months). If you were combat medic/corpsman, easier transition. But non-medical veterans succeed too - it's about precision, following procedures, staying calm under pressure. You've done that.

**Veterans Training Programs:**

Austin Community College specifically accepts military healthcare experience for advanced standing in radiology, respiratory, and surgical tech programs. Submit DD-214 and Joint Services Transcript - your military training counts toward requirements. Combat medics, Navy corpsmen, Air Force medics get credit for military healthcare training (completed within last 10 years).

VA has training programs - Minneapolis VA School of Radiologic Technology provides comprehensive education with clinical experience. Check if VA near you offers healthcare training.

GI Bill covers associate degree programs for these technical roles. Two years school, lifetime career with solid pay and job security.

**For Non-Medical MOS:**

You can pursue these technical paths even without medical MOS. Programs accept civilians all the time - your military discipline and ability to learn complex procedures actually advantage. Associate degree programs teach from ground up. Your edge: you follow protocols, handle stress, pay attention to safety, work well in teams. That matters more than prior medical experience for these technical roles.

**VA as Employer:**

VA actively recruiting veterans for all roles - not just clinical. VA police (90% veterans), custodial (85% veterans), administrative, IT, facility operations. Veteran preference in hiring. You understand VA patients because you are one. VA offers federal benefits, pension, job security.

**Medical Device Sales - No Degree Path:**

Many medical device companies hire veterans without bachelor's degree if you demonstrate sales aptitude and technical understanding. Start as associate sales rep or territory support, prove yourself, move into full sales role. Your ability to learn technical products, present to doctors/administrators, follow up professionally matters more than degree. Emphasize your experience with medical equipment in military healthcare facilities.

**Healthcare Administration Entry:**

Start as department coordinator or administrative assistant in hospital ($40K-$50K), learn operations, move into management. Many healthcare administrators started in entry roles and promoted internally. Veterans excel because you understand chain of command, follow procedures, coordinate across departments. Hospital operations similar to military logistics in many ways.

**Starting Strategy:**

**Option 1 - Medical device sales (fastest, highest pay):** Research medical device companies (Stryker, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Zimmer Biomet). Apply for associate sales rep or territory rep positions. Highlight leadership, presentation skills, technical aptitude, experience in military healthcare settings. Timeline: 3-6 months, immediate income.

**Option 2 - Technical healthcare (solid career, requires training):** Choose respiratory, radiology, or surgical tech based on interest. Apply to associate degree programs using GI Bill. If combat medic/corpsman, check veteran-specific programs that credit military training. Complete 2-year program. Graduate with certification and immediate job offers. Timeline: 2-3 years including school, but $60K-$80K career afterward.

**Option 3 - Healthcare administration (broad opportunities):** Apply to hospital administrative positions. Start coordinator/assistant roles, gain experience, pursue healthcare administration degree part-time if desired (GI Bill). Move into management. Timeline: immediate entry, 3-5 years to management levels.

**Reality Check:**

Healthcare stable, recession-proof industry. Everyone needs medical care regardless of economy. Aging population increases demand. Whether technical roles, administration, or sales - healthcare offers solid careers for veterans. Your military skills valued. Multiple entry paths depending on your timeline and interests.

Medical device sales highest pay but most competitive. Technical roles require school but provide stable middle-class career. Administration offers flexibility and advancement potential. Choose based on your strengths and goals.

**Companies Actively Hiring Veterans:**

HCA Healthcare (65,000 veterans hired since 2012), Northwell Health, VA system, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Kaiser Permanente. All have military recruiting programs. Leverage veteran hiring initiatives.
