[MAIN CONTENT - 20-22 minutes]

**Segment 1: Your 35F Skills Are Data Analytics Skills (4 minutes)**

As a 35F, you've been doing professional intelligence analysis. But strip away the military context and look at what you're actually doing - you're a data analyst.

You collect information from multiple sources, analyze datasets, identify patterns and trends, create intelligence products and reports, brief findings to stakeholders, and make data-driven recommendations. That's data analytics.

You've used intelligence databases and software systems. You've worked with DCGS-A (Distributed Common Ground System-Army), created intelligence summaries, analyzed SIGINT and HUMINT data, and produced targeting packages.

Here's why civilian companies value 35Fs:

**First** - you know how to work with classified and sensitive information. This means you understand data security, compartmentalization, and need-to-know principles. Civilian companies handling sensitive data need analysts who take security seriously.

**Second** - you can synthesize information from multiple sources. Modern business intelligence requires pulling data from various systems and creating coherent analysis. That's what you do.

**Third** - you communicate analytical findings to non-technical audiences. You've briefed commanders who needed actionable intelligence, not technical jargon. That's exactly what business stakeholders need.

**Fourth** - you have a Top Secret clearance. If it's active, that's worth $20K-$30K in additional salary for defense contractor work.

Salary reality: As a 35F E5 or E6, you're making around $50K-$60K total. Civilian data analysts make $70K-$95K, senior analysts make $90K-$120K, and data scientists make $110K-$150K+. Defense contractors with TS/SCI clearances can make $90K-$140K+.

**Segment 2: Civilian Career Paths for 35Fs (5 minutes)**

**Data Analyst**
Analyzing business data, creating reports and dashboards, identifying trends, supporting business decisions. You're working with tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau, or Power BI.
Salary: $70,000 to $95,000. This is the entry point for most 35Fs transitioning to civilian analytics.

**Business Intelligence Analyst**
Similar to data analyst but more focused on strategic business insights. You're analyzing market data, competitive intelligence, customer behavior, business performance metrics.
Salary: $75,000 to $105,000. Your intelligence background fits perfectly here.

**Operations Research Analyst**
Using analytical methods to help organizations solve problems and make better decisions. Common in defense, logistics, and manufacturing.
Salary: $80,000 to $120,000.

**Cyber Intelligence Analyst / Threat Intelligence Analyst**
Analyzing cyber threats, identifying threat actors, tracking attack patterns, producing threat intelligence reports.
Salary: $85,000 to $130,000. Your intelligence analysis skills plus some cybersecurity knowledge creates excellent career opportunities.

**Data Scientist**
Advanced role using statistical analysis, machine learning, and programming to extract insights from complex datasets.
Salary: $110,000 to $150,000+. This typically requires additional technical skills (Python, R, machine learning) but it's achievable for 35Fs willing to learn.

**Defense Intelligence Contractor**
Providing intelligence analysis support to DOD, intelligence community, or government agencies as a contractor.
Salary: $80,000 to $140,000+ depending on clearance level and contract. TS/SCI clearance can add $20K-$30K to base salary.

Companies hiring: **Defense contractors** (Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI, Leidos, SAIC, BAE Systems, General Dynamics IT), **Tech companies** (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta need threat intelligence and data analysts), **Finance** (JPMorgan, Capital One, major banks need fraud analysts and business intelligence), **Consulting** (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte need analysts), **Government agencies** (CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI hiring civilian intelligence analysts).

**Segment 3: Technical Skills and Certifications You Need (5 minutes)**

Your 35F intelligence skills are valuable, but you need some technical additions for civilian roles.

**Critical Technical Skills:**

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**: This is how you query databases. Essential for data analyst roles. You can learn SQL basics in 4-8 weeks using free resources online. Practice on platforms like SQLBolt or Khan Academy.

**Excel (Advanced)**: Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data analysis functions. Most 35Fs have basic Excel, but you need advanced skills. Free YouTube tutorials can get you there.

**Data Visualization**: Tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker. These create dashboards and visualizations. Tableau has free public version for learning. Many certification courses available.

**Python (for data science path)**: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning. Takes 3-6 months to learn basics. Free resources: Codecademy, Python.org tutorials.

**Certifications That Add Value:**

**Google Data Analytics Certificate**: $39/month on Coursera, takes 3-6 months. Covers SQL, data visualization, data analysis process. Good entry-level certification recognized by employers.

**Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst**: Focuses on Power BI tool widely used in corporate environments. Exam costs ~$165.

**Tableau Desktop Specialist**: Certification for Tableau visualization tool. Exam costs ~$100.

**CompTIA Security+** (if going cyber intelligence route): Required for many DOD contractor intelligence roles. We covered this in Episode 7 for 25Bs - same applies for 35Fs going into cyber threat intelligence.

**Certified Analytics Professional (CAP)**: Advanced certification for experienced analysts. $495-$695. Good after 2-3 years in civilian analytics role.

**For defense contractors**: Many require specific intelligence community certifications like CDASA (Certified Defense All-Source Analyst).

**My recommended path:**
- **While still in**: Learn SQL basics, advanced Excel, start learning Tableau or Power BI
- **First 6 months civilian**: Get Google Data Analytics Certificate or Microsoft Power BI certification
- **Year 1-2**: Add programming skills (Python) if pursuing data science path
- **Year 3+**: Consider advanced certifications like CAP

**Segment 4: Defense Contractor vs Corporate - Which Path? (3-4 minutes)**

You have two main paths:

**Defense Contractor Intelligence Work:**
**Pros**: You already know the work. Your clearance is extremely valuable. Higher starting salaries with clearance ($90K-$130K). Familiar work environment. Job security on stable contracts.
**Cons**: Still supporting military/government operations. May require deployment or travel. Clearance investigation stress. Less diverse than corporate work.

**Corporate Data Analytics:**
**Pros**: Diverse industries and problems. Often better work-life balance. More career mobility between companies. Innovative environments. No deployment requirements.
**Cons**: Lower starting salary without clearance advantage ($70K-$85K). Need to learn business context. More competition from civilians with analytics degrees.

**My recommendation**: Consider starting as defense contractor for 2-3 years. You maintain your clearance, earn good money, and build civilian work experience. Then transition to corporate if you want more variety. Or stay in defense contracting - many analysts build entire careers there at $120K-$160K+ as senior analysts.

**Segment 5: Your Transition Timeline (3 minutes)**

**12 months out**: Start learning SQL and Tableau/Power BI. Use free resources. Build sample projects analyzing public datasets.

**6-9 months out**: Create portfolio of analysis projects. Take Google Data Analytics Certificate course. Update resume translating intelligence analysis to data analytics terms.

**3-6 months out**: Apply for SkillBridge with tech companies or defense contractors. Start job applications. Network on LinkedIn with data analysts and business intelligence professionals.

**1-2 months out**: Interview actively. Show your portfolio. Negotiate offers. Defense contractors: emphasize your clearance and intelligence background. Corporate roles: emphasize analytical skills and ability to work with business stakeholders.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

35F Intelligence Analysts transition naturally to data analytics, business intelligence, and threat intelligence careers paying $75K-$150K+. Your analytical skills, briefing experience, and security clearance create strong demand.

Learn SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools while still in service. Get Google Data Analytics Certificate or Power BI certification in your first year. Defense contractors pay $90K-$140K+ with active TS/SCI clearance. Corporate data analysts start $70K-$95K and grow to $120K+ as senior analysts.
