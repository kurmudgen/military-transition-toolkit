[MAIN CONTENT - 22-24 minutes]

**Segment 1: Understanding Your Marketability (4 minutes)**

Alright, let's start with the good news. If you're Air Force aircraft maintenance, you are in a high-demand field. [pause] The civilian aviation industry needs qualified mechanics and technicians, and they need them right now.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of aircraft mechanics and technicians is projected to grow 5% from 2024 to 2034. That's faster than the average for all occupations. They're projecting about 13,100 job openings per year over the next decade.

Why? Because the aviation industry has a massive aging workforce problem. A lot of the current mechanics and technicians are baby boomers who are retiring. Airlines and aerospace companies are struggling to replace them with qualified people.

That's where you come in.

Your Air Force training is valuable for several reasons:

**First** - you've worked on complex aircraft systems under strict quality standards. Civilian aviation also operates under strict FAA regulations and quality standards. Your military experience shows you can work in that regulated environment.

**Second** - you have hands-on troubleshooting experience. You know how to diagnose problems, use technical manuals, and fix things correctly the first time. That's exactly what civilian aviation needs.

**Third** - you understand the safety-critical nature of the work. In aviation, mistakes can be catastrophic. The military trains you to take that seriously, and civilian employers recognize that.

**Fourth** - you've likely worked on jet engines, hydraulics, electrical systems, flight controls, or avionics. Those skills transfer directly to civilian aircraft, whether it's commercial airlines, cargo operations, or business aviation.

Now here's the reality check. Your military training is valuable, but it's not always a direct one-for-one match to civilian requirements. Most civilian aviation jobs require FAA certifications that you might not have yet.

The big one is the A&P license. That's A-and-P, Airframe and Powerplant mechanic certificate. We're going to talk about that in detail in a minute.

But first, let's talk about the specific civilian careers you can pursue and what they pay.

**Segment 2: Civilian Aviation Career Paths and Salaries (6 minutes)**

Let me break down the major career paths for aircraft maintenance folks transitioning to civilian aviation.

**Aircraft Mechanic / A&P Mechanic**

This is the most direct path. You're maintaining and repairing civilian aircraft - commercial airlines, cargo carriers, business jets, whatever.

Salary range: The median annual wage for aircraft mechanics and service technicians was $78,680 in May 2024. The lowest 10% earned less than $47,790. The highest 10% earned more than $120,080.

Entry-level positions with airlines or major aerospace companies generally start around $60,000 to $70,000 annually. With experience, you can push into the $80,000 to $100,000 range. Senior mechanics at major airlines can make over $120,000.

The highest-paying jobs tend to be with major airlines in high-cost-of-living areas. Think Delta, American, United, FedEx, UPS - the big carriers based in hubs like Atlanta, Chicago, Memphis, Louisville.

Companies actively hiring right now:
- **Delta Air Lines** - they have a veteran hiring program and they need mechanics at all their major hubs
- **American Airlines** - consistently hiring A&P mechanics, veteran-friendly
- **United Airlines** - also veteran-friendly, hiring at multiple locations
- **FedEx** - cargo operation, excellent pay and benefits, Memphis-based but positions nationwide
- **UPS** - similar to FedEx, Louisville-based with positions nationwide
- **Southwest Airlines** - hiring mechanics, good culture for veterans
- **Boeing** - both commercial and defense side, need maintenance and production mechanics
- **Lockheed Martin** - defense contractor, often need mechanics with security clearances
- **Northrop Grumman** - same deal, defense work

**Avionics Technician**

If you're 2A0X1 - Avionics - or you've worked on aircraft electronics, this is your path.

Salary range: The median annual wage for avionics technicians was $81,390 in May 2024. That's actually higher than general aircraft mechanics because avionics is more specialized.

You're installing, troubleshooting, and repairing aircraft electrical and avionics systems - navigation, communication, radar, flight control systems.

Same companies hire avionics techs as hire A&P mechanics, but there's also work with avionics manufacturers and specialized avionics shops.

**Aerospace Propulsion Specialist / Engine Mechanic**

If you're 2A6X1 - Aerospace Propulsion - this is your specific path. You're working on aircraft engines, either turbine engines on jets or turboprop engines.

Salary range: Similar to A&P mechanics, $60K to $120K+ depending on experience and employer.

But there's a specialized market here. Engine overhaul and repair facilities - places like Pratt & Whitney, GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce - they need engine specialists. These facilities do depot-level maintenance on jet engines. The work is specialized and the pay reflects that.

**Aircraft Inspector**

If you've been in maintenance for a while and you have senior-level experience, you can move into inspection roles. Inspectors check the work of other mechanics to ensure it meets FAA standards.

This requires your A&P license plus experience. But the pay is good - inspectors make $70K to $100K+ depending on the company and location.

**Maintenance Manager / Supervisor**

If you were a shift supervisor, production superintendent, or maintenance flight chief in the Air Force, you have management experience that translates to civilian maintenance management roles.

Airlines and aerospace companies need people to manage maintenance teams, coordinate work schedules, ensure quality standards, and keep operations running.

Salary range: $80K to $120K+ for management positions. Senior maintenance managers at major airlines can make significantly more.

**Aircraft Maintenance at Air Force Civilian Service**

If you want to stay with the Air Force but as a civilian, AFCS - Air Force Civilian Service - hires aircraft mechanics to work on military aircraft at Air Force bases.

Salary range: According to recent data, the average annual salary for Aircraft Mechanic at Air Force Civilian Service is approximately $67,959 per year, with the majority of salaries between $59,424 to $77,382.

The advantage here is you already know the aircraft, you know the environment, and federal jobs come with good benefits and job security.

The disadvantage is the pay typically doesn't match what major airlines will pay, and you're still working in the military environment even though you're a civilian.

**Contract Maintenance**

There are also contract positions - working for companies that provide contract maintenance services to airlines or military bases. These can be good for getting experience and building your resume, but they often pay less than direct hire positions with major airlines.

Alright, those are the main paths. Now let's talk about what you need to get hired.

**Segment 3: The A&P License - What It Is and How to Get It (6 minutes)**

This is the critical certification for most civilian aviation jobs. The A&P license - Airframe and Powerplant mechanic certificate - issued by the FAA.

Let me explain what this is and why it matters.

The FAA requires that anyone performing maintenance, preventive maintenance, or alterations on aircraft must be properly certified. The A&P license is that certification.

There are actually two certificates:
- **Airframe** - covers the aircraft structure, systems, and components excluding the powerplant
- **Powerplant** - covers aircraft engines and their systems

Most people get both certifications together - that's the "A&P" - because it qualifies you to work on complete aircraft.

Here's the challenge for Air Force maintenance troops. [emphasis: "Your military training is valuable, but it doesn't automatically give you the A&P license."] You have to get that certification separately.

There are three ways to get your A&P:

**Option 1: Use your military experience to qualify for the FAA exams**

The FAA allows you to use documented military experience to qualify to take the A&P exams without going to an FAA-approved school.

You need 30 months of practical experience working on either airframes or powerplants, or 18 months of practical experience working on both simultaneously.

Most Air Force maintenance AFSCs give you that experience. If you've been working on aircraft for 3 years, you likely qualify.

Here's the process:
1. Get a letter from your unit certifying your maintenance experience
2. Apply to an FAA Flight Standards District Office - that's FSDO
3. The FAA reviews your experience and issues you authorization to test
4. You take three tests for each certificate (Airframe and Powerplant) - that's a written test, an oral test, and a practical test
5. If you pass all six tests, you get your A&P license

Cost: About $150 per knowledge test (written), plus fees for the oral and practical exams. Total cost is roughly $1,000 to $1,500 for all the testing.

Timeline: If you study aggressively, you can knock this out in 3 to 6 months while you're still in or right after you get out.

**Option 2: Attend an FAA-approved Aviation Maintenance Technician School**

These are civilian schools that offer FAA-approved A&P programs. The programs are typically 18 to 24 months.

The advantage is they prepare you comprehensively for the exams and you don't have to document your military experience.

The disadvantage is cost and time. These programs can cost $15,000 to $40,000, although you can use your GI Bill to cover it.

This option makes sense if:
- You don't have enough documented military experience to qualify under Option 1
- You want structured learning and comprehensive prep
- You have time to do an 18-24 month program

Schools to look at: Spartan College of Aeronautics, Aviation Institute of Maintenance, Redstone College, Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics - there are dozens of FAA-approved schools nationwide.

**Option 3: Get hired and get your A&P on the job**

Some employers will hire you without an A&P if you have military aircraft maintenance experience, and they'll help you get your A&P while you work.

This is less common, but it happens, especially with contractors or smaller operators who need people immediately.

The advantage is you're getting paid while you work toward your certification.

The disadvantage is not all employers offer this, and you'll likely make less money until you get certified.

**My recommendation:**

Start working on your A&P while you're still in the Air Force. About 12 to 18 months before you separate, start gathering your documentation, studying for the written tests, and preparing to test.

If you can walk out of the Air Force with your A&P in hand or close to getting it, you're going to have way more job opportunities and you can negotiate higher starting pay.

There are prep courses and study materials specifically for the A&P exams. Look for resources from:
- Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook - free download from FAA
- Prepware A&P test prep software
- Online courses from King Schools or Sporty's

You can study for this on your own. A lot of guys do.

**Segment 4: Additional Certifications and Skills That Increase Your Value (3-4 minutes)**

Beyond the A&P, there are other certifications and skills that can increase your earning potential.

**FCC License for avionics**

If you're working on aircraft radios and communications equipment, you need an FCC - Federal Communications Commission - General Radiotelephone Operator License.

This is required for anyone who maintains or repairs aircraft radio equipment. If you're avionics, you probably already have the military equivalent. You just need to get the civilian FCC license.

Cost: About $60 for the exam. Study time: 2-4 weeks.

**Inspection Authorization (IA)**

This is an advanced certification that allows you to inspect and approve major repairs and annual inspections on aircraft.

You need your A&P license plus 3 years of experience to qualify for IA.

Having an IA significantly increases your value and opens up inspector positions that pay $80K to $100K+.

**Manufacturer-specific training**

Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, Gulfstream - these manufacturers offer specialized training on their specific aircraft.

If you get hired by an airline or aerospace company, they'll usually send you to this training. But if you can get it on your own through military programs or using your GI Bill, it makes you more marketable.

For example, Boeing offers training at their facilities in Seattle and other locations. Airbus has training centers as well.

**Composite repair training**

Modern aircraft use composite materials extensively. If you have composite repair training and certification, you're more valuable.

This is something you can potentially get while you're still in if your unit works with composite aircraft.

**Welding certifications**

If you have welding skills and certifications, especially for aircraft metals like aluminum and titanium, that's valuable for certain maintenance roles.

**Security clearance**

If you have an active security clearance and you keep it current, you can work on military aircraft for defense contractors. These positions often pay more than commercial aviation work because clearances are required and they're hard to get.

Clearance jobs might be with Boeing Defense, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, or contractors working directly on military bases.

Bottom line - the more certifications and specialized skills you have, the more options you have and the more you can negotiate on salary.

**Segment 5: Your 12-18 Month Transition Plan (4 minutes)**

Alright, let's bring this together. You're Air Force aircraft maintenance, you've got 12 to 18 months left on your contract. Here's your action plan.

**18 months out:**

Start gathering documentation of your maintenance experience. You need to prove to the FAA that you have the required months of experience working on airframes and powerplants.

Talk to your supervision - Flight Chief, Production Superintendent, whoever - and get a letter documenting your experience. You want this letter to specify:
- What aircraft you worked on
- What systems you maintained (airframe, engines, electrical, etc.)
- How many months of experience you have
- Your dates of service in maintenance roles

Research FAA requirements and start studying for your A&P written exams. Download the FAA handbooks, get prep software, start learning the material.

**12 months out:**

Take your A&P written exams. There are three tests for Airframe and three for Powerplant (General, Airframe, Powerplant for each). You want to knock these out while you're still in.

Cost is about $150 per test. You can take them at FAA-approved testing centers.

Start building your civilian resume. Translate your Air Force maintenance experience into civilian language. Instead of "2A6X1 Aerospace Propulsion Journeyman," say "Aircraft Engine Mechanic with 5 years of experience maintaining and repairing jet engines on F-16 and C-130 aircraft."

**9 months out:**

Apply for SkillBridge if you can. SkillBridge lets you work at a civilian company during your last 180 days of service while still getting military pay.

Airlines and aerospace companies participate in SkillBridge. You could do a SkillBridge internship as an aircraft mechanic at Delta, American, or another major airline. This gives you experience, networking, and often leads to a job offer before you even separate.

**6 months out:**

Start applying to jobs even if you haven't separated yet. Put your expected separation date on your resume and in your cover letter.

Many companies will interview you months before you separate and make conditional job offers.

Update your LinkedIn profile. Connect with veteran aviation groups. Join groups like "Veterans in Aviation" or "Military Aviation Maintainers" on LinkedIn and Facebook.

**3 months out:**

Complete your A&P practical exams if you haven't already. You need to go to an FAA Designated Mechanic Examiner - that's DME - for your oral and practical tests.

These tests involve demonstrating your knowledge and skills hands-on. The examiner will ask you questions and have you perform tasks on actual aircraft components.

Cost: Usually $500 to $1,000 per practical exam (Airframe and Powerplant). Total cost for both is typically $1,000 to $2,000.

Finalize your job offers. Negotiate your salary - we'll cover negotiation tactics in a future episode, but don't just accept the first offer. Companies expect you to negotiate.

**1 month out:**

Confirm your start date. Calculate your terminal leave. If you have 60 days of leave, that's 60 days of getting paid by the military while you start your civilian job.

Get all your training records, maintenance logs, and certifications organized. You'll need to show these to civilian employers.

Complete your final out-processing and get your DD-214.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap.

Air Force aircraft maintenance troops have highly marketable skills for civilian aviation. Aircraft mechanics earn a median of $78,680, with top earners making over $120,000. Major airlines like Delta, American, United, FedEx, and UPS are actively hiring.

The key certification you need is your A&P license - Airframe and Powerplant. You can qualify for the exams using your military experience, or you can attend an FAA-approved school. Start working on this 12-18 months before you separate.

Your 18-month plan: Gather documentation, study for A&P exams, take written tests, apply for SkillBridge, start job applications, complete practical exams, and negotiate your job offers.
