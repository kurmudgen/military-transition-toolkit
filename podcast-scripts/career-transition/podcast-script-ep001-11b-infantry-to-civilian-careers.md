[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

Here's the truth about transitioning out as an 11B infantry soldier - you've got more career options than you think. The problem? Most guys have no idea how to translate what they've been doing for the past four, six, or ten years into something a civilian hiring manager actually understands. [pause] That's what we're fixing today.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement right now, and I built Military Transition Toolkit to help service members like you navigate this whole process. In today's episode, we're talking specifically to Army infantry guys - the 11 Bravos - who are looking at civilian careers and wondering what the hell they're supposed to do next.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering the real career paths that actually work for former infantry. You'll learn which civilian jobs are actively hiring infantry guys, what salary ranges you can expect - and I'm talking real numbers here - and the specific steps to take in your last 12 months of service to set yourself up. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 24-28 minutes]

**Segment 1: The Infantry Translation Problem (5 minutes)**

So let's start with the elephant in the room. You're an infantryman. Your job has been to close with and destroy the enemy. You've done patrols, raids, security operations. You've led fire teams or squads. You've maintained weapons systems and operated in high-stress environments. [pause]

And then you sit down to write a resume and you realize - how do I put "conducted combat operations in Helmand Province" on a job application for a company that makes software? [pause] Right?

Here's what's happening. The civilian world doesn't have a direct equivalent to infantry. There's no job posting that says "looking for someone who can clear a building and call for fire support." That specific skill set doesn't exist in the civilian sector. [emphasis: "But that doesn't mean you don't have valuable skills."]

Let me break down what you actually do as an 11B that translates to civilian work:

First - leadership and team management. If you've been a team leader, squad leader, or platoon sergeant, you've managed people under the most stressful conditions imaginable. You've made decisions with incomplete information. You've held people accountable for their performance. That's leadership. That's management. And companies need that.

Second - security and threat assessment. You've been trained to identify threats, assess risks, and respond appropriately. Every day in garrison or downrange, you're evaluating your environment for potential dangers. Civilian companies need this for physical security, executive protection, and risk management roles.

Third - training and instruction. If you've ever run ranges, led PT, or trained new privates, you've got instructional experience. That translates directly to corporate training roles, especially in companies that have field operations or safety-critical work.

Fourth - and this is big - you can follow complex procedures under pressure. Infantry guys operate off standard operating procedures, battle drills, and tactical checklists. You can take a complex process, break it down, and execute it flawlessly when it matters. That's exactly what companies need for operations management, logistics coordination, and process improvement roles.

Now here's the key. [pause] Most infantry guys undersell these skills. They think because they don't have a college degree in business or a certification in project management, they're not qualified. That's wrong. You are qualified. You just need to translate your experience into language that civilian hiring managers understand.

That's what the rest of this episode is about - the specific civilian career paths that work for infantry backgrounds, and how to position yourself for them.

**[Transition statement]**

Alright, let's get into the actual careers. I'm going to break these down by category - law enforcement and security, corporate operations, skilled trades, and tech and IT. Each of these has different requirements, different pay ranges, and different paths to get in.

**Segment 2: Law Enforcement and Government Security (6 minutes)**

This is probably the most obvious path, and it's obvious for a reason - it works. Law enforcement agencies actively recruit military veterans, and infantry guys fit naturally into police work, federal law enforcement, and corrections.

Let's talk specific jobs and real salaries.

**Police Officer** - this is the big one. Municipal police departments, county sheriffs, and state police all have veteran hiring preferences. Average starting salary is around fifty-nine thousand dollars per year. That's $59,000. Not amazing, but it goes up. With five to ten years on the job, you're looking at seventy to eighty thousand, plus overtime, plus pension benefits.

Here's the path: Most departments require a high school diploma or equivalent - you've got that. Many require some college, but a lot of departments waive that requirement for military veterans with honorable discharges. You'll need to pass a physical fitness test - not a problem for infantry guys - and complete the police academy, which is typically 16 to 26 weeks. The academy is paid in most departments.

Companies hiring right now: NYPD, LAPD, Chicago PD, and basically every mid-sized city department in the country. They're all undermanned. Go to their websites, there's veteran-specific recruiting pages.

**Federal Law Enforcement** - this is border patrol, TSA, federal protective service, and eventually FBI or DEA if you want to go that route. Border Patrol starts at around fifty-two thousand but goes up to eighty-five thousand within a few years. TSA Transportation Security Officers start lower, around forty thousand, but it's federal employment with benefits and room to move up.

For Border Patrol specifically - they're hiring like crazy right now. You need to be under forty years old when you apply, you need a valid driver's license, and you need to pass a background check and drug test. The academy is 117 days in Artesia, New Mexico. It's paid. And your infantry background - especially if you have any desert or border operation experience - is a huge selling point.

**Executive Protection and Close Protection** - this is bodyguard work, but professional level. High-net-worth individuals, corporate executives, celebrities - they all need security. Average salary is around seventy-one thousand per year, but if you get into high-level executive protection, you can make six figures.

The catch? You need training and experience. You can't just get out and become a bodyguard. But there are transition programs. Look at Executive Security International, or EPI - Executive Protection Institute. They run courses specifically for military veterans. Cost is around three to five thousand for a two-week course. That's an investment, but it can pay off.

**Corrections Officer** - I'm going to be honest, this is not the most glamorous job, but it's stable federal employment with decent benefits. Federal Bureau of Prisons starts corrections officers at around forty-five thousand. With overtime - and there's a lot of overtime - you can push that to sixty or seventy thousand. State systems vary widely.

The advantage here? Low barrier to entry. High school diploma, pass a background check, complete training. And BOP has veteran preference in hiring.

**Private Military Contracting** - I have to mention this because a lot of infantry guys ask about it. Contractors working overseas in security roles can make serious money. We're talking fifteen thousand to twenty-two thousand dollars per month. That's $15K to $22K. [pause] Monthly.

But let's be real about this. Contracting work is dangerous, it's unpredictable, and the market has shrunk significantly since the Iraq and Afghanistan drawdowns. If you want to do a contract rotation or two to build up a financial cushion, it's an option. But don't count on it as a long-term career. The work isn't consistent, and you're still operating in high-threat environments.

Where to look: Constellis, Triple Canopy, Academi - these are the big contracting firms. You need prior combat experience, you need a security clearance or the ability to get one, and you need to be willing to deploy for six to twelve months at a time.

**[Quick mid-roll CTA]**

Quick reminder - all the resources I'm mentioning today are available for free at militarytransitiontoolkit.com. Link in the show notes. We've got resume templates, company lists, salary calculators - all built specifically for transitioning service members. Alright, back to career paths.

**Segment 3: Corporate Operations and Logistics (5 minutes)**

This is where a lot of infantry guys don't think to look, and that's a mistake. Corporate America needs people who can manage operations, coordinate logistics, and solve problems under pressure. That's what you've been doing.

**Operations Manager** - this is someone who oversees the day-to-day operations of a business or a facility. Manufacturing plants, warehouses, distribution centers - they all need operations managers. Average salary is around seventy-five thousand dollars per year, ranging from sixty thousand starting out to over one hundred thousand with experience.

What do you actually do? You manage teams, you optimize processes, you solve problems when things break down, and you make sure the operation runs smoothly. [pause] That's what a platoon sergeant does every single day. Same skills, different environment.

How do you get in? Some companies want a bachelor's degree, but many will waive that for military leadership experience, especially if you've got six or more years in and E5 or above. Look for companies with veteran hiring programs. Amazon, FedEx, UPS - they all hire veterans specifically for operations roles.

**Supply Chain and Logistics Coordinator** - if you've ever dealt with supply in the Army, you understand logistics. You understand how to move people and equipment from point A to point B. You understand what happens when supply chains break down. Companies need that, especially in logistics and distribution.

Average salary is around sixty-three thousand dollars per year. Entry-level logistics coordinators start around fifty thousand, experienced supply chain managers can make ninety thousand or more.

Companies hiring: DHL, DB Schenker, C.H. Robinson, XPO Logistics. These are massive global logistics companies and they need people who understand how to coordinate complex movements. Your experience running convoy operations or coordinating movement of personnel and equipment - that's directly applicable.

**Project Coordinator and Project Manager** - this is coordinating projects, managing timelines, keeping teams on track, and delivering results. Infantry squad leaders and platoon sergeants do this constantly - you're just not calling it "project management."

Entry-level project coordinators make around fifty-five thousand. Certified Project Managers with a PMP - that's Project Management Professional certification - can make eighty-five to one hundred thousand or more.

Here's a smart move: use your GI Bill to get a Project Management Professional certification while you're still in or right after you get out. The PMP requires 35 hours of project management education and passing an exam. There are online courses specifically designed for military transition. Cost is around two to three thousand dollars total, or free if you use your GI Bill.

**Training and Development Specialist** - companies need people to train their workforce. If you've been a squad leader, team leader, or senior specialist responsible for training privates, you have this experience. Average salary is around fifty-seven thousand, ranging from forty-five to seventy-five thousand depending on the company and industry.

Look for roles in companies that have field operations, manufacturing, or safety-critical work. They need people who can train others on procedures and hold them accountable. That's what you do.

**Segment 4: Skilled Trades and Technical Careers (5 minutes)**

This is a path that a lot of people overlook, but skilled trades are in massive demand right now, and they pay well. We're talking electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, heavy equipment operators, wind turbine technicians - these are all careers where infantry guys can transition successfully.

**Electrician** - average salary is around sixty thousand dollars per year, but experienced electricians can make eighty to ninety thousand or more. Union electricians in major cities can push six figures.

The path: You need to complete an apprenticeship, which is typically four to five years. But here's the thing - you get paid while you're learning. Apprentice electricians start around thirty-five to forty thousand per year and go up as they progress. And many apprenticeship programs give credit for military experience, so you might be able to shorten the timeline.

Look into programs like Helmets to Hardhats - that's H-E-L-M-E-T-S to H-A-R-D-H-A-T-S. They connect military veterans with union apprenticeship programs in construction and skilled trades. It's free to join.

**Plumber and Pipefitter** - similar path to electrician. Apprenticeships, paid training, average salary around fifty-eight thousand, experienced plumbers make seventy-five to ninety thousand. Commercial and industrial plumbers make even more.

**HVAC Technician** - heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Average salary around fifty-three thousand, but experienced HVAC techs can make seventy to eighty thousand. You need certification - typically six months to two years of trade school - but many programs are covered by GI Bill.

**Heavy Equipment Operator** - if you've operated military vehicles, you can transition to civilian heavy equipment. Bulldozers, excavators, cranes - construction and mining companies need operators. Average salary is around fifty-two thousand, crane operators can make seventy to eighty thousand.

Many states will give you credit toward a commercial driver's license - a CDL - based on your military driving experience. Look into your state's Military Skills Test Waiver program.

**Wind Turbine Technician** - this is a newer field, but it's growing fast. Wind energy is expanding, and they need technicians to install and maintain turbines. Average salary is around fifty-seven thousand. It requires technical training - usually a two-year degree or certificate program - but it's an option if you want to get into renewable energy.

The common thread with all of these trades? They're hands-on, they require problem-solving and attention to detail, and they value the discipline and work ethic that military guys bring. And most importantly - they pay well and have strong job security.

**Segment 5: Getting Into Tech and IT (4-5 minutes)**

Now, I know what you're thinking - "Jacob, I'm an infantry guy. I shot rifles and did patrols. How the hell am I supposed to get into tech?"

Here's the thing. [pause] You absolutely can get into tech. It's not immediate, and it requires some training, but the path exists and veterans are doing it successfully.

Let me give you the realistic path into IT and cybersecurity:

**Step 1: Get your baseline IT certification while you're still in.**

The CompTIA A+ certification is the entry-level IT cert that gets you in the door. It covers basic computer hardware, software, networking, and troubleshooting. Cost to take the exam is around two hundred fifty dollars, or you can use your GI Bill to take a prep course.

Study time is about three months if you're starting from zero IT knowledge. There are free resources online - Professor Messer has a complete free A+ course on YouTube. That's Professor M-E-S-S-E-R.

**Step 2: Get an entry-level IT job**

With an A+ cert and military experience, you can get hired as an IT support specialist, help desk technician, or junior systems administrator. Starting salary is around fifty to fifty-five thousand, depending on location.

This is your foot in the door. You're learning on the job, you're building experience, and you're setting up for the next step.

**Step 3: Pursue higher-level certifications**

Once you've got six months to a year of IT experience, you start stacking certifications:
- CompTIA Network+ for networking knowledge
- CompTIA Security+ for cybersecurity - this is a big one, it's required for a lot of DOD contracting IT jobs
- Then you can go into specialized areas - CISSP for security management, CEH for ethical hacking, or cloud certifications like AWS Certified Solutions Architect

Each of these certs opens up higher-paying roles. Security+ gets you into the sixty-five to seventy-five thousand dollar range. CISSP gets you to eighty-five to one hundred thousand or more.

**Step 4: Consider using your GI Bill for a tech degree or bootcamp**

If you want to accelerate, there are coding bootcamps and cybersecurity programs designed for veterans. Some are free for veterans:
- VET TEC program - that's Veterans Employment Through Technology Education Courses - covers tuition for approved tech training programs
- Hiring Our Heroes Tech Fellowship
- NPower's cybersecurity training program

These are typically 12 to 20 week intensive programs that take you from zero to job-ready in a specific tech field.

**Real success stories:**

There are infantry guys who've made this transition. I found multiple examples researching this episode. Paul Andrus - Marine Corps infantry veteran - now works as a principal data scientist at Oracle. Jereme Hardy - Army veteran - went through a cybersecurity program and now works as a cybersecurity engineer making six figures.

The key? They committed to learning new skills, they used available programs and benefits, and they were patient with the process. This isn't a three-month transition. It's a 12 to 24 month path. But it works.

**Segment 6: Your Action Plan for the Next 12 Months (3-4 minutes)**

Alright, let's bring this all together. You're an 11B, you're getting out in the next 12 months - what do you actually do?

**12 months out:**

Decide your path. Are you going law enforcement? Corporate operations? Skilled trades? Tech? You need to pick a direction. It's okay to have a backup plan, but you need to focus your effort.

Start your education and training NOW. If you're going for certifications, start studying. If you're going into trades, research apprenticeship programs. If you're going law enforcement, look at department requirements.

Get on SkillBridge if you can. SkillBridge lets you do a civilian job training program during your last 180 days of service while still getting military pay. It's basically a free internship. Law enforcement agencies, tech companies, corporate operations roles - they all participate.

**9 months out:**

Start building your civilian network. Connect with veterans who've made the transition you're planning. LinkedIn is your tool here. Search for people with your MOS who are now in the career you want. Send messages. Ask for 15-minute phone calls. Most veterans will help you.

Update your resume. Do NOT just list your duty descriptions from your NCOER. Translate your experience into civilian language. If you need help, Military Transition Toolkit has resume templates specifically for infantry guys. Free download.

**6 months out:**

Start applying to jobs, even if you're not getting out for six more months. Here's why - you want to start getting interviews. Even if you're not ready to accept a job yet, the interview practice is invaluable. You'll learn what questions they ask, what they're looking for, and you'll get better at talking about your experience in civilian terms.

Register for TAP - that's Transition Assistance Program - if you haven't already. It's mandatory, but take it seriously. The resume workshops and interview prep are actually useful.

**3 months out:**

This is when you finalize your job offer if possible. If you're going into a training program or apprenticeship, this is when you lock in your start date.

Calculate your terminal leave. If you have 60 days of leave saved up, that's 60 days of getting paid to job hunt or start your civilian job.

**Final month:**

Confirm your start date for your civilian job or training program. Make sure it aligns with your separation date or terminal leave.

Get all your medical documentation. Seriously, get copies of everything. You'll need it for VA claims and potentially for civilian jobs that require medical clearance.

Final out-processing. Get your DD-214, make copies, keep the original safe.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap what we covered today.

You've got more career options as an 11B than you probably realized. Law enforcement and government security are the obvious paths, but corporate operations, skilled trades, and tech are all realistic options. The key is translating your military experience into civilian language and starting your transition planning early.

Specific action steps: Pick your career path in the next 30 days. Start your training or certifications in the next 60 days. Build your network and update your resume in the next 90 days. And use all the resources available to you - GI Bill, SkillBridge, VET TEC, TAP.
