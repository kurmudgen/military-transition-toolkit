[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** Salary isn't total compensation. Benefits add twenty to forty percent. Job at seventy thousand with strong benefits often better than eighty thousand with weak benefits. Here's how to calculate real value and compare offers properly.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Total Compensation vs Salary:**

Military taught you total compensation thinking - base pay plus BAH, BAS, healthcare, commissary access, pension. Civilians focus on salary number. Mistake. Total compensation includes everything of value employer provides.

Average: Benefits worth 29.7% of your compensation (BLS data). Total comp typically 25-40% higher than base salary. $80K salary might be $100K-$112K total comp. Comparing offers by salary alone misleads - must compare total packages.

**The Total Compensation Formula:**

Base Salary
+ Annual Bonus/Commission (target amount)
+ Health Insurance Value (~$10K-$25K)
+ 401(k) Match (typically 3-6% of salary)
+ Other Benefits (life insurance, disability, dental, vision)
+ Equity (stock options, RSUs)
+ Paid Time Off Value
+ Perks (gym, transportation, learning budget, etc.)
= **Total Annual Compensation**

Let's break down each component.

**Base Salary:**

Fixed annual amount. Foundation of your comp. But only part of picture. Don't fixate on this number alone.

Example: Job A offers $85K base. Job B offers $80K base. Can't determine better offer yet - need rest of package.

**Annual Bonus/Commission:**

Variable pay based on performance. Three types:

**1. Performance Bonus:** Percentage of base. "10% annual bonus at target performance." Calculate: $80K salary × 10% = $8K bonus. Add to base for comp comparison.

Reality: Target bonus. If you hit goals, you get it. Underperform, less. Overperform, more. Conservative estimate: Count 75% of target bonus in calculations (accounts for variability).

**2. Commission:** Sales roles. Percentage of sales. "On-target earnings $120K ($70K base + $50K commission)." That $50K assumes hitting quota. Same logic - count 75% conservatively = $37.5K. Total comp $107.5K.

**3. Sign-On Bonus:** One-time first year. Don't count in annual comp comparison (it's one-year only), but valuable for immediate cash flow. Often has payback clause if you leave within 12 months.

Compare offers: Factor in realistic bonus/commission (75% of target), not just base.

**Health Insurance (Huge Value):**

Military spoiled you - free healthcare (or nearly). Civilian shock: Health insurance expensive.

**Employer-Sponsored Plans Value:**
- Average value for single employee: ~$10K-$15K/year
- Family coverage: ~$20K-$25K/year

**What To Evaluate:**

**Premium Cost:** Your monthly contribution. Lower = better. Some employers cover 100% (rare, valuable). Others you pay $200-$500/month. Calculate annual cost: $300/month = $3,600/year out of your pocket.

**Deductible:** Amount you pay before insurance kicks in. Lower = better. High-deductible plans ($3,000-$7,000) risky if you have health issues. Low deductible ($500-$1,500) costs more in premiums but less risk.

**Out-of-Pocket Maximum:** Worst-case annual medical costs. Critical number. $3,000 max vs $8,000 max big difference if you or family have health needs.

**Network:** PPO (more flexible, more expensive) vs HMO (limited network, cheaper). EPO middle ground.

**Comparison Example:**
- Company A: $85K salary, you pay $400/month premium ($4,800/year), $5,000 deductible
- Company B: $80K salary, company covers 100% premium ($0/year cost to you), $1,500 deductible

Company B effective comp $5K higher just on health insurance ($4,800 saved premiums + better deductible).

Veterans: TRICARE eligibility changes healthcare math. If you have service-connected disability or retire with 20 years, VA healthcare available. Factor this - civilian health insurance less valuable to you. Negotiate other benefits instead.

**401(k) Match (Free Money):**

Employer contributes percentage of your salary to retirement if you contribute.

**Common Structures:**
- "100% match up to 3%": You contribute 3% salary ($80K × 3% = $2,400), employer contributes $2,400. Free $2,400 annually.
- "50% match up to 6%": You contribute 6% ($4,800), employer contributes $2,400 (50% of your contribution).

Average employer match: 4.3% of salary (Fidelity data). On $80K salary = $3,440 annual match.

**Long-term Value:** Compounding massive. $80K salary, 3% match ($2,400/year), over 20 years with 8% return = $73,628 additional retirement savings just from match.

**Vesting:** Some companies require staying X years before match is yours. Immediate vesting best. 3-5 year vesting means leaving early forfeits unvested match.

**Comparison Impact:**
- Company A: $85K, no 401(k) match
- Company B: $80K, 5% match ($4,000/year)

Company B total comp higher: $84K vs $85K - and that $4K grows tax-deferred for decades.

**Paid Time Off (Your Time Has Value):**

Calculate hourly value. $80K salary ÷ 2,080 hours/year = $38.46/hour. Extra 5 vacation days (40 hours) = $1,538 value.

**PTO Comparison:**
- Company A: 10 days vacation (80 hours) = $3,077 value
- Company B: 20 days vacation (160 hours) = $6,154 value

$3K difference. Significant.

Also consider: Sick days separate or combined? Unlimited PTO (sounds great but often people take less)? Parental leave? Paid holidays (how many)?

**Equity Compensation (Tech/Startups):**

**Stock Options:** Right to purchase company stock at set price (strike price). If stock price increases above strike price, you profit. If not, worthless. Risk/reward.

Example: 1,000 options, $10 strike price. Stock goes to $50. You buy 1,000 shares at $10 ($10K), sell at $50 ($50K), profit $40K. Stock stays at $10 or drops - options worthless.

**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units):** Company grants you shares that vest over time (typically 3-5 years). More common than stock options. Less risky - shares have value even if stock price drops (though less value).

Example: $20K RSUs vesting over 4 years. Year 1: $5K vests. Year 2: $5K vests. Etc. Taxed as ordinary income when they vest.

**Valuing Equity:**
- Public companies: Use current stock price × shares. Conservative: Discount 20% for volatility.
- Private companies/startups: Highly speculative. Don't count in comp unless company near IPO or acquisition. Treat as lottery ticket, not guaranteed comp.

**Other Benefits:**

- **Life Insurance:** Many employers provide 1× salary free. Additional coverage purchasable.
- **Disability Insurance:** Short-term and long-term. Valuable if you become unable to work.
- **Dental/Vision:** Usually separate from health. Low cost but nice to have.
- **HSA/FSA:** Health Savings Account or Flexible Spending Account. Pre-tax money for medical expenses. HSA better (rolls over, yours forever).

**Perks (Nice But Don't Overvalue):**

- Gym membership reimbursement: ~$500-$1,000/year value
- Transportation/parking subsidy: $1,000-$3,000/year depending on city
- Learning/professional development budget: $1,000-$5,000/year
- Remote work: Saves commute cost (gas, car wear) and time. $2,000-$5,000 value depending on commute.
- Free food/snacks: Hard to quantify, maybe $500-$1,000/year if daily meals provided

Count these but don't let them sway decision over fundamentals (salary, health insurance, 401k).

**The Hidden Costs:**

**Commute:** 30-minute commute each way = 1 hour daily, 250 hours/year (6+ weeks of work time). Plus gas, car maintenance. Remote saves this. Factor in.

**Example:** Job A pays $85K, 1-hour roundtrip commute (250 hours/year). Job B pays $82K, remote. Effective hourly rate:
- Job A: $85K ÷ 2,330 hours (work + commute) = $36.48/hour
- Job B: $82K ÷ 2,080 hours (work only) = $39.42/hour

Job B pays better per hour worked.

**Relocation:** Moving costs $3K-$10K. If employer doesn't reimburse, factor this into first-year comp.

**The Comparison Spreadsheet:**

Build simple spreadsheet comparing offers:

| Component | Company A | Company B |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Base Salary | $85,000 | $80,000 |
| Target Bonus (75%) | $6,375 | $4,500 |
| Health Premium Cost | -$4,800 | $0 |
| 401k Match | $0 | $4,000 |
| PTO Value | $3,077 | $6,154 |
| Equity (annual vest) | $5,000 | $0 |
| **Total Comp** | **$94,652** | **$94,654** |

Essentially equal. Other factors (culture, growth, role) become tiebreakers.

**Non-Financial Factors (Weigh These):**

- Career growth potential: Which role advances career faster?
- Manager quality: Who will you learn more from?
- Company trajectory: Growing company or declining?
- Work-life balance: 50-hour weeks vs 40-hour weeks?
- Remote flexibility: Office, hybrid, full remote?
- Team culture: Did you connect with team during interviews?

These matter for long-term satisfaction and career success. Don't ignore for extra $5K if role is miserable or dead-end.

**The Decision Framework:**

1. Calculate total compensation both offers (use formula above)
2. Compare total comp numbers
3. If total comp within 10% ($90K vs $99K), consider equal - decide on non-financial factors
4. If total comp differs 10%+ ($80K vs $95K), higher comp wins unless major red flags (terrible culture, no growth, unsustainable company)

**Special Veteran Considerations:**

- **VA Healthcare:** If you have VA healthcare, civilian health insurance less valuable. Negotiate higher salary or other benefits in exchange for accepting higher-deductible plan.
- **GI Bill:** Some companies offer tuition reimbursement. Less valuable to you if you have unused GI Bill. Negotiate elsewhere.
- **Clearance:** If role requires clearance you already have, that's $10K-$15K value to employer (they didn't pay to clear you). Use as negotiation leverage.
