12 months out: Complete Security+ if not done. Start CEH or OSCP study. Build home lab for practice.

6-9 months out: Take CEH exam. Update LinkedIn showcasing skills (not classified work details). Apply SkillBridge cyber companies.

3-6 months out: Apply defense contractors emphasizing clearance. Apply private sector cyber roles. Interview demonstrating technical and operational knowledge.

Separate: Start role $90K-$130K+. Continue cert path (CISSP, specialized). Clearance maintenance critical for contractor work.

**Clearance Value:** TS/SCI worth $20K-$40K salary premium. Companies pay more because clearances take 12-18 months process. Keep active by working cleared positions first few years. Opens doors to specialized contracts.
