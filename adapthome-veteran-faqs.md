# AdaptHome Veteran FAQs

## Eligibility & Grants

### 1. What VA grants does AdaptHome help me with?

AdaptHome helps veterans navigate three main VA housing grant programs. The SAH (Specially Adapted Housing) grant provides up to $115,956 for major modifications like wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, or accessible bathrooms. The SHA (Special Housing Adaptation) grant covers up to $23,444 for less extensive modifications. Finally, the HISA (Home Improvements and Structural Alterations) grant provides up to $6,800 for minor accessibility improvements.

Our cost calculator is designed to help you understand which grant fits your needs based on the modifications you're planning. For example, if you need a roll-in shower and grab bars, you might be looking at the SHA range. But if you need a complete bathroom remodel plus doorway modifications, you're likely in SAH territory. The calculator gives you real estimates based on Southern California pricing so you know what to expect before you even apply.

### 2. Do I need to already have my VA grant approved to use AdaptHome?

Not at all—AdaptHome is useful whether you're just starting to think about modifications or already have your grant approved. If you're early in the process, our cost calculator helps you understand what's financially possible within each grant limit. This is huge for planning your VA application because you'll know if your wishlist fits within SAH, SHA, or HISA limits before you submit paperwork.

That said, contractors in our network are most excited about working with veterans who have already been approved for their grants, because it means the project is ready to move forward. If you haven't applied yet, we can still match you with contractors—they're happy to provide estimates and consultation that you can include with your VA application. Either way, you're in the right place.

**Start with the calculator to see where you stand, then let us match you with contractors who can help you through the next steps.**

### 3. I'm getting medically retired next year—can I use AdaptHome now?

Absolutely. Many service members start planning their home modifications during the medical board process, especially if they know they'll need accessibility features. Using our calculator now helps you understand the scope and cost of potential modifications, which can inform your housing decisions as you prepare for retirement.

Here's the thing: the actual VA grant application typically happens after you've separated and have your final disability rating. But there's no reason you can't be researching contractors, getting preliminary estimates, and planning your modifications while you're still on active duty. In fact, the contractors in our network appreciate working with veterans who are organized and planning ahead. It makes the whole process smoother once your grant gets approved.

**Go ahead and use the calculator to start planning. When you're ready to connect with contractors, we'll be here.**

### 4. I live in Los Angeles—does AdaptHome cover my area?

Right now, AdaptHome is focused on Southern California, specifically San Diego, Orange County, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. If you're in Los Angeles County, we're not quite there yet, but it's absolutely on our expansion roadmap. We started with these four counties because we wanted to build a strong network of quality contractors before expanding statewide.

Here's what you can do: join our waitlist for LA County expansion. We're tracking interest by region, and areas with more waitlist signups get prioritized for expansion. Plus, when we do launch in your area, waitlist members get first access to the contractor network. We're a veteran-owned operation built by someone going through transition right now, so we get it—we're growing thoughtfully but as fast as we can.

**Not in our service area yet? Join the waitlist and we'll notify you as soon as we expand to your region.**

---

### 5. What if I already started my project with a random contractor I found online?

You can absolutely still use AdaptHome's cost calculator to verify you're getting fair pricing, even if you've already found a contractor. Just enter your ZIP code and the modifications you're planning—our calculator gives you real market rates for Southern California. If your contractor's quote is way higher than our estimate, that's a red flag worth investigating.

However, here's what we'd recommend: the contractors in our network are specifically experienced with VA grants and the paperwork involved. A contractor who's done 50 VA modifications knows the approval process, the documentation requirements, and the common pitfalls. If you're early enough in your project that switching contractors is still possible, it might save you headaches down the road. That said, we're here to help veterans make informed decisions, not to pressure anyone.

**Get a second opinion with our calculator, and if you want to explore VA-experienced contractors, we'll match you for free.**

## Calculator & Cost Estimates

### 6. How accurate is the AdaptHome cost calculator?

Our cost calculator uses real Southern California construction pricing data, updated regularly to reflect current market rates. We account for regional variations—a bathroom remodel in San Diego costs differently than the same project in Riverside—so entering your ZIP code gives you a localized estimate. For example, if you're planning a roll-in shower installation, our calculator factors in labor rates, material costs, and permit fees specific to your county.

That said, every home is different. The calculator gives you a solid ballpark figure that's accurate for typical installations, but your actual cost could vary based on your home's age, layout, and any unexpected issues (like old plumbing that needs updating). Think of our estimate as your reality check—if a contractor quotes you double our estimate, you know to ask questions. If they're in the same range, you're probably looking at a fair price.

**Try the calculator with your ZIP code and modification list to get your personalized estimate in under 2 minutes.**

---

### 7. Can I use the calculator for multiple different modification scenarios?

Yes, and we actually encourage this. Most veterans aren't sure exactly what modifications they need until they start exploring options and costs. You might run the calculator with "roll-in shower + grab bars" and see it's $12,000, well within your SHA grant. Then you might try adding "widened doorways + accessible sink" and see the total jump to $28,000, which means you'd need to apply for SAH instead.

This kind of scenario planning is exactly what the calculator is built for. You can run it as many times as you want, with different combinations of modifications, to figure out what fits your needs and your grant limits. Some veterans find that splitting their wishlist into "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves" helps them stay within budget. The calculator lets you test those scenarios before you commit to anything.

**Play around with different modification combinations to find the sweet spot between your needs and your budget.**

---

### 8. Why does the calculator ask for my disability type?

Different disabilities require different types of modifications, and those modifications have very different costs. A wheelchair user might need ramps, widened doorways, lowered counters, and roll-in showers—that's a comprehensive list that adds up quickly. Someone with limited mobility might just need grab bars and a walk-in tub. By knowing your disability type, the calculator can suggest relevant modifications you might not have thought of.

For example, if you select "wheelchair user," the calculator might flag that you'll likely need doorway modifications throughout your home, not just in the bathroom. That helps you plan more completely and avoid surprises later. It also helps us match you with contractors who have specific experience with your type of project. A contractor who's done 20 wheelchair-accessible bathroom remodels is going to give you better results than someone figuring it out for the first time.

**Be specific about your disability type so we can give you the most relevant estimates and contractor matches.**

---

### 9. What if my calculator estimate is higher than my grant limit?

This is actually valuable information to have early. If you're planning $130,000 in modifications but your grant maxes out at $115,956 (SAH limit), you know you need to either prioritize certain modifications or plan to cover the difference out of pocket. Many veterans use a combination of VA grant funds plus personal savings or financing to complete their ideal setup.

Here's what you can do: use the calculator to adjust your modification list until you get under your grant limit. Focus on the changes that most impact your daily safety and independence. You can always phase the project—do the essentials with grant funds now, then save up for the nice-to-haves later. The contractors in our network are experienced with these conversations and can help you strategize what to prioritize.

**If your estimate exceeds grant limits, adjust your modification list or talk to a contractor about phased approaches.**

---

### 10. Do I need to create an account to use the calculator?

Nope—the cost calculator is completely free and requires zero login, no email address, nothing. We built it this way intentionally because we know veterans are tired of every website demanding your personal information before you can get basic answers. You can use the calculator anonymously as many times as you want.

The only time we ask for your contact information is when you're ready to be matched with contractors. At that point, we need your email and phone number so contractors can reach out with quotes and availability. But if you just want to run numbers and do research? Go for it. No strings attached. We're veteran-owned and operated—we get that trust is earned, not demanded.

**Use the calculator right now without creating an account. Only share your info when you're ready to talk to contractors.**

## Contractor Matching

### 11. How does AdaptHome choose which contractors to match me with?

We match you based on three main factors: your location, the type of modifications you need, and contractor availability. All contractors in our network are either CAPS-certified (Certified Aging-in-Place Specialists) or have significant experience with VA grant projects. For example, if you're in San Diego needing a wheelchair ramp and bathroom remodel, we'll match you with contractors in San Diego who've successfully completed similar VA-funded projects.

Unlike HomeAdvisor or Thumbtack where your request gets blasted to 5-10 contractors (most of whom have never done VA work), we provide exclusive matches. The contractor we connect you with gets your lead exclusively—you're not one of five veterans they're competing against. This means they're more motivated to provide detailed quotes and better service. It also means you're not getting bombarded with calls from a dozen contractors.

**When you're ready for a match, we'll connect you with a qualified contractor who has the exact experience you need.**

---

### 12. What does "CAPS-certified" mean and why does it matter?

CAPS stands for Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist—it's a credential from the National Association of Home Builders for contractors who specialize in home modifications for accessibility. CAPS-certified contractors are trained in everything from ADA compliance to understanding how different disabilities affect home design needs. They know the difference between building a ramp that technically meets code and building one that actually works for your daily life.

For VA grant projects, this expertise matters even more. CAPS contractors understand the documentation the VA requires, they know how to design modifications that'll pass VA inspection, and they're familiar with common grant approval pitfalls. A regular contractor might build you a beautiful bathroom, but will it meet VA specifications? A CAPS contractor knows what the VA is looking for before they even start the project.

**Working with CAPS-certified contractors increases your chances of smooth VA approval and a modification that truly meets your needs.**

---

### 13. Can I interview multiple contractors before choosing one?

Currently, our beta model provides you with one exclusive contractor match based on your needs and location. This is different from traditional lead services, and here's why: we're providing contractors with pre-qualified leads (you have a VA grant or are actively pursuing one), so they're offering premium service in return. The contractor you're matched with should provide a detailed consultation, thorough quote, and references from past VA projects.

That said, you're never obligated to work with the contractor we match you with. If the consultation doesn't feel right or you want a second opinion, just let us know. We're still in beta, building relationships with contractors throughout Southern California. As our network grows, we may offer multiple matching options. For now, we're focused on quality over quantity—one great match beats five mediocre ones.

**Get matched with a vetted contractor, and if it's not the right fit, we'll work with you to find another option.**

---

### 14. What if I'm matched with a contractor but they're booked for months?

Contractor availability is a real issue in Southern California, especially for specialized accessibility work. If your matched contractor has a waitlist, we'll let you know the timeline upfront so you can decide whether to wait or request a different match. Some veterans don't mind waiting 2-3 months for a contractor they trust, especially if they're still navigating the VA approval process anyway.

Here's the advantage of our network: because contractors are getting exclusive leads instead of competing against five other bids, many of them prioritize AdaptHome matches. You're a known quantity—pre-qualified, grant-approved or actively applying, serious about the project. That often moves you up the priority list compared to random inquiries. But if timing is critical for you, just let us know and we'll find someone with earlier availability.

**We'll give you honest timelines upfront, and work with you to find a contractor whose availability matches your needs.**

---

### 15. How do I know these contractors won't overcharge me because the VA is paying?

This is a legit concern, and it's exactly why we built the cost calculator. You have the power to verify you're getting fair pricing before you sign anything. If a contractor quotes you $40,000 for a bathroom remodel and our calculator estimated $22,000 for the same work in your ZIP code, you know something's off. Our estimates are based on real market rates, so you're walking into every conversation with a reality check in your back pocket.

Beyond that, the contractors in our network know they're being monitored. We track veteran feedback, and contractors who consistently overcharge or provide poor service get removed from the platform. This isn't Yelp where bad contractors can stick around forever—we're curating this network specifically for VA grant work. Our reputation is tied to their performance, so we're motivated to keep the quality high. Plus, as a veteran-owned company run by someone who's about to retire and might need these services himself, we take this personally.

**Use the calculator to verify pricing, and if something feels off, reach out to us. We're here to make sure you're treated fairly.**

---

## Project Timeline

### 16. How long does the VA grant approval process take after I apply?

The VA grant approval process typically takes 30-60 days from application submission, though it can vary. The timeline depends on factors like how complete your application is, whether you've included contractor estimates, and current VA processing volumes. Having detailed quotes from experienced contractors (like those in the AdaptHome network) can actually speed up approval because the VA has all the information they need to evaluate your request.

Here's a pro tip from contractors who've been through this dozens of times: incomplete applications are the #1 cause of delays. If you submit your VA application without cost estimates, without specific modification details, or without proper medical documentation supporting your need, you'll get a request for more information—and that restarts the clock. Working with a VA-experienced contractor from the beginning helps you submit a complete, approval-ready package the first time.

### 17. Once my grant is approved, how long until my modifications are complete?

Project timelines vary widely based on the scope of work. Simple modifications like grab bar installation and minor bathroom updates might be completed in 1-2 weeks. A comprehensive wheelchair-accessible renovation with ramps, doorway widening, and full bathroom remodel could take 6-12 weeks. Permitting adds time—some counties in Southern California process permits in 2-3 weeks, others take 6-8 weeks.

The contractors in our network will give you realistic timelines during the quote process. They know that for many veterans, these aren't cosmetic upgrades—they're necessary modifications that affect daily safety and independence. Most prioritize VA grant projects and stay in close communication throughout the timeline. One thing that helps: having your grant already approved when you start. Projects where veterans are waiting for grant approval mid-construction create unnecessary delays.

**Ask your matched contractor for a detailed timeline that includes permitting, construction, and final VA inspection.**

---

### 18. What happens if the VA inspects my completed project and finds issues?

VA inspection failures are rare when you work with experienced contractors, but they do happen. Common issues include modifications that don't meet ADA specifications, safety concerns, or work that doesn't match what was approved in your grant. The good news: these are almost always fixable. The contractor returns and corrects whatever the VA flagged, then you schedule a re-inspection.

This is another reason why working with contractors who have VA grant experience matters. They know what VA inspectors look for—proper ramp slopes, correct grab bar placement and anchoring, adequate doorway widths, appropriate bathroom layouts. A contractor doing their first VA project might make rookie mistakes. A contractor who's done 50 VA projects? They're building it right the first time because they've learned what passes inspection.

**Choose VA-experienced contractors to minimize the risk of inspection issues and ensure your project meets all VA requirements.**

---

## Privacy & Security

### 19. What information does AdaptHome share with contractors?

When you request a contractor match, we share your name, phone number, email, ZIP code, disability type (in general terms), and the specific modifications you're interested in. This gives the contractor everything they need to provide an accurate quote and understand your project scope. We do NOT share your full medical records, specific disability rating, financial information, or any details beyond what's necessary for the project estimate.

Contractors in our network sign agreements that require them to handle your information professionally and use it only for providing quotes and services related to your project. They're not allowed to sell your contact info, add you to marketing lists without permission, or share your details with other companies. If a contractor violates these terms, they're removed from the platform immediately. We're veteran-owned and operated—we treat your information the way we'd want ours treated.

**Your privacy matters. We share only what contractors need to help you, and nothing more.**

---

### 20. Is my information secure on AdaptHome's website?

Yes. AdaptHome is built on enterprise-grade infrastructure with industry-standard security practices. We use Supabase (a secure, SOC 2 compliant platform) for our backend, and all data transmission is encrypted. Your payment information (when we eventually add contractor subscription features) is handled by Stripe—we never store credit card numbers on our servers. We're hosted on Vercel, which provides DDoS protection and automatic security updates.

Here's our philosophy: as a veteran-owned company founded by an active duty service member, we understand the importance of operational security. We're not some sketchy startup cutting corners—we've built this platform with the same attention to security we'd expect from any service we'd use ourselves. You can use the cost calculator completely anonymously, and when you do share information to get contractor matches, it's protected with bank-level encryption.

**Your data is encrypted, secure, and handled with the same standards we'd expect for ourselves. Because we're veterans too.**
