## LEGAL & COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### FTC Disclosure Requirements (2025)

#### Core Requirement
The FTC requires disclosure of affiliate relationships that could influence endorsements or promotions. ALL affiliate marketers must comply, regardless of size.

#### "Clear and Conspicuous" Standard

**What it means:**
- Easily understandable to average person
- Prominently visible without expertise needed
- Assessed from "reasonable consumer" perspective
- If significant number might miss it, it fails compliance

**Three Critical Elements:**

1. **Prominence**
   - Font size must be easily readable
   - Don't hide disclosures
   - Subject to FTC enforcement if hidden

2. **Presentation**
   - Plain, simple language
   - No jargon or dense text
   - State affiliation simply and clearly

3. **Placement**
   - BEFORE or WITH the affiliate link/endorsement
   - On EVERY page with affiliate links
   - NOT sufficient: bottom of page, sidebar, footer only
   - Must be visible without scrolling ("above the fold")

#### Acceptable Disclosure Language

**GOOD Examples:**
- "This post contains affiliate links"
- "We may earn a commission if you purchase through these links"
- "Affiliate Link" or "Paid Link" (directly next to link)
- "We partner with companies that compensate us when you click or purchase"

**NOT SUFFICIENT:**
- "Commissionable link" (unclear to consumers)
- Hidden in privacy policy only
- Disclosure only on homepage
- In hashtags buried among other tags

#### Where to Place Disclosures

**Required locations:**
1. Top of blog posts/pages (above fold)
2. Near each affiliate link
3. Before/with endorsements and recommendations
4. In social media posts (at beginning, not buried in hashtags)

**NOT acceptable alone:**
- Footer of website
- Separate disclosure page only
- Privacy policy only
- Below the content

### Specific Requirements for MTT

#### On Every Page with Affiliate Links
```
AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE
Military Transition Toolkit is supported by our users. We may earn a commission
when you click on or purchase through links on our site. This helps us keep the
toolkit 100% free for veterans and active duty service members. Our recommendations
are based on quality and relevance to your transition needs.
```

#### Near Affiliate Links
- Badge or label: "[Affiliate Link]" or "[Partner]"
- Inline disclosure: "This is an affiliate link, which means we may earn a commission..."

#### In Content
When recommending specific products/services:
> "We've partnered with [Company] to bring you this resource. If you sign up through
> our link, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you."

### Types of Compensation Requiring Disclosure

1. **Monetary commissions** - ALL affiliate commissions
2. **Free products/services** - If received for review/promotion
3. **Discounts** - Special deals in exchange for promotion
4. **Revenue sharing** - Any payment based on referrals
5. **In-kind compensation** - Non-monetary benefits

### Nonprofit Considerations

While MTT may not be a registered nonprofit, if positioning as free service for veterans:

1. **Ethical alignment:** Only promote products that genuinely help veterans
2. **Mission focus:** Affiliate relationships shouldn't conflict with helping veterans
3. **Transparency:** Be especially clear about how affiliate revenue keeps service free
4. **Research partners:** Avoid companies with poor veteran practices

### State-Level Requirements

**General Rule:** FTC regulations apply nationwide. Most states defer to FTC.

**No special state affiliate licenses required** for most content-based affiliate marketing.

**Exception:** If providing licensed services (financial advice, legal advice, real estate),
separate licensing may be required regardless of affiliate model.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**FTC Penalties:**
- Warning letters
- Consent decrees
- Fines (can be substantial)
- Required corrective advertising

**Affiliate Network Penalties:**
- Account suspension
- Commission forfeiture
- Permanent ban from network

**Reputation Damage:**
- Loss of user trust
- Negative press
- Reduced conversions

### Compliance Checklist for MTT

- [ ] Add disclosure banner to all affiliate pages
- [ ] Create dedicated affiliate disclosure page
- [ ] Update privacy policy
- [ ] Update terms of service
- [ ] Label individual affiliate links
- [ ] Add disclosure to resources page
- [ ] Create disclosure for email newsletters (if used)
- [ ] Add disclosure to social media posts with affiliate links
- [ ] Review disclosure placement (above fold)
- [ ] Use clear, simple language
- [ ] Test disclosure visibility on mobile
- [ ] Document compliance procedures
- [ ] Train any team members on disclosure requirements
- [ ] Periodically audit all pages for compliance

### International Considerations

If MTT serves international audience:

- **UK:** ASA (Advertising Standards Authority) similar rules
- **Canada:** Similar disclosure requirements
- **Australia:** ACCC (Competition & Consumer Commission) similar rules
- **EU:** GDPR considerations for data collection

**Rule of thumb:** If content reaches US audience, follow FTC guidelines regardless of your location.

### Best Practice: Go Beyond Minimum

**Why veteran audience demands extra trust:**
1. Military community values integrity
2. Many scams target veterans
3. Building long-term relationships matters more than quick revenue
4. Transparency aligns with military values

**Recommended approach for MTT:**
- Be MORE transparent than required
- Explain specifically how affiliate revenue keeps site free
- Highlight that recommendations are genuine, affiliate relationship is secondary
- Show value of curated, tested resources
- Maintain editorial independence (clearly state affiliate status doesn't influence recommendations)
