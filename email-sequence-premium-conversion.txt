EMAIL 1: You've Hit Your Free Limit
Send: Immediate upon hitting free tier limit
Subject Line: You've maxed out your free resume exports
Preview Text: Here's what happens next (and what you're missing)...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You just hit your free tier limit.

You've exported 3 resumes (the free limit). That means you're actually using the platform—which is great.

But now you're stuck. You need to export another version, but you can't.

**Here's what's happening:**

Free accounts get 3 resume exports. Why? Because we want you to try the tools without commitment. But unlimited exports require server resources, storage, and ongoing support.

**Your options:**

**Option 1: Upgrade to Premium**
- Unlimited resume exports
- Advanced VA claims research (secondary conditions database)
- Interview prep platform with company research
- Priority support (same-day responses)
- Career coaching credits ($500 value)

**Cost:** $29/month or $249/year (save 30%)

**Option 2: Stay on Free**
You can still use all the basic tools—resume builder, VA tracker, job search management. You just can't export more than 3 resumes.

**No pressure. Your choice.**

But here's the thing: If you're actively applying to jobs, you need more than 3 resume versions.

You need a version tailored for each company. A version for project management roles. A version for operations roles. A version for logistics.

One generic resume doesn't cut it anymore.

**Limited-time offer for free users hitting their limit:**

Upgrade in the next 48 hours and get your first month for $19 instead of $29.

That's 34% off. Enough to export unlimited resumes and access all premium features.

After 48 hours, regular pricing applies.

Your call.

EMAIL 2: What Premium Users Are Achieving
Send: 1 day after hitting limit
Subject Line: Premium users land jobs 2.3x faster
Preview Text: Real results from veterans who upgraded...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You're still on the fence about premium. I get it.

Let me show you what premium users are actually achieving.

**Mark (Army E-6, 8 years)**
- Used secondary conditions research to add 40% to his VA rating
- Went from 30% ($524/month) to 70% ($1,788/month)
- Lifetime value: $379,200 more
- Premium cost: $249/year
- **ROI: First month paid for 150+ years of premium**

**Sarah (Navy E-5, 6 years)**
- Used interview prep platform to research 8 companies
- Received 3 offers in 2 months
- Negotiated salary from $65K to $78K using our data
- Extra earnings: $13K first year
- **ROI: 52x in year one**

**David (Marines E-7, 12 years)**
- Exported 12 tailored resumes using unlimited feature
- Applied to 30+ jobs with customized resumes
- Landed job in 6 weeks (average for premium users: 8 weeks)
- Average for free users: 18 weeks
- **Result: Started earning civilian salary 12 weeks earlier = $18K more**

**These aren't cherry-picked success stories. This is typical.**

Premium users succeed faster because they have better tools and better information.

**What you get with premium:**

✓ **Unlimited resume exports** (stop being limited by arbitrary caps)
✓ **Secondary conditions database** (find the VA claims you're missing)
✓ **Interview prep platform** (research companies, practice answers, see salary data)
✓ **Priority support** (same-day email responses from real people)
✓ **Career coaching credits** (1-on-1 support when you need it)

**The honest truth:**

You don't need premium to succeed. Plenty of veterans transition successfully with free tools.

But premium users succeed faster, with less stress, and often with better outcomes.

**Is 2-3 months of faster transition worth $29/month?**

You decide.

EMAIL 3: Premium vs Free—The Honest Breakdown
Send: 3 days after hitting limit
Subject Line: What you get (and don't get) in free vs premium
Preview Text: Complete feature comparison with no BS...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

Let's be completely transparent about what you get with free vs premium.

**RESUME TOOLS**

Premium: Everything free has + unlimited exports, ATS optimization score, professional templates, resume review service

**WHO IS FREE GOOD FOR?**

You're more than 6 months from separation. You're just starting to research. You want to test the platform before committing.

**WHO IS PREMIUM GOOD FOR?**

You're actively job searching. You're filing a VA claim soon. You want expert guidance. You're on a tight timeline. You want every advantage.

**The decision framework:**

If premium saves you 2 weeks in your job search, what's that worth?
- Average veteran salary: $65,000/year
- Two weeks: $2,500
- Premium for 3 months: $87
- **ROI: 28.7x**

If premium helps you add 20% to your VA rating, what's that worth?
- Difference (50% to 70%): $466/month
- Lifetime value (25 years): $139,800
- Premium for 1 year: $249
- **ROI: 561x**

**Those aren't hypotheticals. Those are actual outcomes from premium users.**

You can do the math yourself.

EMAIL 4: Last Chance—Special Pricing Expires Tomorrow
Send: 5 days after hitting limit
Subject Line: Your upgrade discount expires in 24 hours
Preview Text: After tomorrow, you'll pay full price...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

This is your last chance to get premium at the discounted rate.

When you hit your free limit 5 days ago, we offered you a special upgrade price: **$19 for your first month** (normally $29).

That offer expires tomorrow at midnight.

After that? You'll pay $29/month like everyone else.

**Why am I being pushy about this?**

Because I've watched thousands of veterans go through transition. The ones who invest in the right tools early succeed faster and with less stress.

The ones who wait? They struggle longer, make more mistakes, and often end up paying for MORE expensive services later (resume writers, career coaches, VSO services).

**Premium is the best value in veteran transition services:**

- Resume writing service: $300-$800 (one-time, one resume)
- Career coach: $150-$300/hour (you'll need 3-5 sessions)
- VSO help: Free but slow and often unhelpful
- Premium: $29/month for everything

**What you're deciding:**

Not whether premium is worth it. You've seen the value. You've read the success stories. You know it works.

You're deciding whether to pull the trigger now at $19/month or wait and pay $29/month later.

**Math time:**

Upgrade today: $19 first month, then $29/month = $48 for first 2 months
Wait until next week: $29/month = $58 for first 2 months

**You're literally leaving $10 on the table by waiting.**

Plus you're delaying access to tools you clearly need (you hit your export limit for a reason).

**48 hours left to decide.**

After that, the discount disappears and you're back to the free tier limits.

EMAIL 5: We'll Save Your Spot
Send: 7 days after hitting limit (if they still haven't upgraded)
Subject Line: Your free account is still here (whenever you're ready)
Preview Text: No pressure. Just wanted you to know your options...
From: Jacob at Military Transition Toolkit

Body:

You didn't upgrade. That's completely fine.

The discount expired. Your free account is still here. You can still use all the basic tools.

**I'm not going to keep pushing you.**

You've heard the pitch. You understand the value. If premium made sense for you, you would've upgraded.

**What happens now:**

You'll still hear from me occasionally. New feature announcements. Helpful transition tips. Success stories from the community.

But I'm done trying to convince you to upgrade. You'll make that decision when (or if) it makes sense for you.

**Your free account includes:**

- Resume builder with military translation (3 exports)
- VA claims tracker
- Job search management
- State benefits database
- Career transition resources
- Community access

That's still more than most transition programs offer at any price.

**If you ever change your mind:**

Premium is always available. Same features, same pricing. Just click upgrade whenever you're ready.

No hard feelings. No judgment. Just tools that are there when you need them.

**One last thing:**

If you didn't upgrade because you genuinely can't afford it right now—not because you don't see the value, but because money is tight—email me directly.

We have a financial hardship program. It's not advertised publicly, but it exists for veterans who need help.

**Your transition matters.** Free or premium, I want you to succeed.

Keep moving forward.

Jacob

P.S. If you do end up upgrading later, you won't see that $19 first-month rate again. Just so you know.
