#### 3. "What is a VA nexus letter?"

**Current Snippet:** None (opportunity!)

**Target Page:** `/va-claims/nexus-letter-guide`

**Optimization Strategy:**
```markdown
## What is a VA nexus letter?

A VA nexus letter is a medical opinion from a healthcare provider that establishes
a connection (or "nexus") between your current disability and your military service.
The letter must include your diagnosis, the provider's credentials, a review of your
medical history, and a clear statement that your condition is "at least as likely as
not" (50% or greater probability) caused by or aggravated by military service.
```

**Snippet Type:** Paragraph (definition)
**Schema:** FAQPage schema
**Competition:** Low (nobody owns this snippet yet)

#### 4. "How long does it take to get a VA disability rating?"

**Current Snippet:** VA.gov (paragraph)

**Target Page:** `/va-claims/timeline`

**Optimization Strategy:**
```markdown
## How long does it take to get a VA disability rating?

The average VA disability claim takes 90-180 days from submission to decision. However,
timelines vary: Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) claims filed 90-180 days before
separation typically receive decisions within 30-60 days after discharge. Fully Developed
Claims (FDC) average 90 days, while standard claims take 120-180 days or longer if
additional evidence is needed.
```

#### 5. "What are VA secondary conditions?"

**Target Page:** `/va-claims/secondary-conditions`

**Optimization Strategy:**
```markdown
## What are VA secondary conditions?

VA secondary conditions are disabilities caused or worsened by a service-connected
condition you already have. For example, if you have a service-connected knee injury
(primary), you can claim back pain caused by limping (secondary). Common secondary
conditions include:

- Back pain secondary to knee/leg injuries
- Depression secondary to chronic pain
- Sleep apnea secondary to PTSD
- Knee pain secondary to back injuries
- Hearing loss secondary to tinnitus

Secondary conditions increase your overall VA disability rating and monthly compensation.
```

#### 6. "What is VA TDIU?"

**Target Page:** `/va-claims/tdiu`

**Optimization Strategy:**
```markdown
## What is VA TDIU?

TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) is a VA benefit that pays veterans
at the 100% disability rate ($3,737/month) even if their combined rating is less than
100%, because their service-connected disabilities prevent them from maintaining
substantially gainful employment. To qualify, veterans typically need at least one
condition rated 60% or higher, or multiple conditions with a combined rating of 70%
or more (including at least one at 40%).
```

**Snippet Type:** Paragraph (definition)
**Competition:** Medium

---

#### 7. "How does VA math work?"

**Target Page:** `/va-claims/va-math`

**Optimization Strategy:**
```markdown
## How does VA math work?

VA math uses a "combined rating" formula, not simple addition. Each disability rating
reduces your remaining "efficiency" rather than adding percentages. For example:

- First disability: 50% rating (you're 50% efficient)
- Second disability: 30% rating (30% of remaining 50% = 15%)
- **Combined rating: 50% + 15% = 65%** (rounds to 70%)

The VA rounds to the nearest 10%. Use the VA's combined ratings table or an online
calculator to determine your total rating when you have multiple disabilities.
```

#### 8. "What is a C&P exam?"

**Target Page:** `/va-claims/cp-exam-tips`

**Optimization Strategy:**
```markdown
## What is a C&P exam?

A C&P (Compensation and Pension) exam is a medical examination the VA schedules to evaluate
your claimed disability and determine your disability rating. During the exam, a VA doctor
or contracted provider reviews your medical history, conducts a physical examination, and
assesses how your condition affects your daily life and work ability. The exam typically
lasts 20-45 minutes, and the provider's report is used by VA raters to make their decision.
