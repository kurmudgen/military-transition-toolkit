**Process:**
1. Gather comprehensive documentation of your CH-53 maintenance experience (training records, evaluations, MOS school certificates, work center qualifications)
2. Contact local FAA FSDO and request FAA Form 8610-2 (Application for Mechanic Certificate)
3. FSDO evaluates documented experience against FAA requirements (30 months airframe OR powerplant, or 18 months in both)
4. **Rotorcraft rating:** Your CH-53 experience covers rotorcraft; you may need additional fixed-wing experience for unrestricted A&P
5. If approved, authorized to test for FAA written, oral, and practical exams
6. Pass exams and receive A&P certificate with ratings

**Time:** 2-6 months depending on FSDO processing
**Cost:** $500-$2,000 (study materials, exam fees, possible prep course)
**Success rate:** High for 6152s with well-documented experience

**Reality check:** Most 6152s qualify for rotorcraft A&P based on CH-53 experience. You may need to demonstrate some fixed-wing experience or take practical exam on both rotorcraft AND fixed-wing to get unrestricted A&P.

Many helicopter jobs only require A&P with rotorcraft rating—unrestricted A&P (rotorcraft + fixed-wing) opens more doors.

### Option 2: Abbreviated Part 147 school
If FSDO determines you need additional documented experience.
**Time:** 3-12 months
**Cost:** $5,000-$20,000 (GI Bill may cover)

### Option 3: Full Part 147 school
**Time:** 12-24 months
**Cost:** $15,000-$40,000 (GI Bill covers)

**Recommendation for 6152s:** Start with Option 1. With 15-25 years of CH-53 maintenance, you likely qualify to test based on experience. Work with FSDO to determine if you need any fixed-wing exposure for unrestricted A&P.
