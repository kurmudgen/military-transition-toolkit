# Resume Writing for Military Spouses: Addressing Employment Gaps Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Military spouse resumes face unique challenges: **employment gaps, diverse unrelated jobs, and frequent location changes**. The solution isn't hiding these realities—it's reframing them strategically. This guide shows you how to create a resume that turns gaps into strengths, connects disparate experience into a coherent narrative, and positions you as the adaptable, capable professional you are.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Your resume probably shows:
- Multiple jobs in different fields
- Gaps between positions (months or years)
- Jobs in multiple states
- Volunteer work mixed with paid roles
- Skills that seem unrelated

**Hiring managers see:** Instability, lack of focus, flight risk

**The truth:** Adaptability, resilience, diverse skills, proven reliability

**The goal:** Reframe your experience so employers see the truth.

## Resume Format Options

### Chronological Format

**Best For:**
- Clear career progression in one field
- Minimal gaps
- Seeking similar positions

**Structure:**
- Contact info
- Summary
- Experience (reverse chronological)
- Education
- Skills

**For Military Spouses:** Often NOT the best choice (highlights gaps and jumps)

### Functional Format

**Best For:**
- Major career changes
- Significant gaps
- Diverse experience in different fields

**Structure:**
- Contact info
- Summary
- Skills/Accomplishments (grouped by category)
- Work history (brief)
- Education

**For Military Spouses:** Can work, but some employers distrust this format

### Combination/Hybrid Format (RECOMMENDED)

**Best For:**
- Military spouses with varied experience
- Those with transferable skills
- Professionals with both gaps and accomplishments

**Structure:**
- Contact info
- Professional summary (tailored to target job)
- Core competencies (skills list)
- Professional experience (reverse chronological, with accomplishments)
- Education and certifications

**Why It Works:**
- Opens with skills, not timeline
- Shows progression while contextualizing gaps
- Highlights transferable abilities
- Maintains chronological credibility

## Addressing Employment Gaps

### Strategy 1: Functional Skill Grouping

Instead of highlighting dates, group experience by skill category:

**Example: Project Management Skills**
- Coordinated household relocation across 3 time zones, managing $15K budget and 10+ vendors
- Organized unit Family Readiness Group events for 200+ attendees
- Managed volunteer teams of 15-25 for annual installation charity events

### Strategy 2: Brief Explanation in Summary

**Example Summary:**
"Administrative professional with 8+ years of experience across healthcare, education, and military family services. Career path reflects strategic relocations supporting military spouse, with consistent professional development and volunteer leadership throughout."

### Strategy 3: Include Relevant Activity During Gaps

**During gaps, you likely did:**
- Volunteer work
- Professional development
- Caregiving
- Education
- Freelance/contract work

**List These:**
- PTA Board Secretary (2021-2022)
- Completed Google Project Management Certificate (2022)
- Volunteer Coordinator, Army Emergency Relief (2020-2021)

### Strategy 4: Years Only (Not Months)

**Instead of:**
- January 2020 - June 2021

**Use:**
- 2020 - 2021

This de-emphasizes short tenures and small gaps.

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't leave gaps unexplained** (looks like you're hiding something)
- **Don't apologize or over-explain** ("Due to my husband's military career...")
- **Don't omit all dates** (creates suspicion)
- **Don't lie about dates** (easily verified, instant disqualification)

## Translating Military Spouse Experience

### Volunteer Work → Professional Experience

**FRG Leader** becomes:
"Volunteer Program Manager – Army Family Readiness Group
- Managed communications for organization serving 150+ military families
- Coordinated 12+ community events annually with budgets up to $5,000
- Led team of 8 volunteers in providing support services"

**Key:** Use professional language, quantify impact, highlight leadership

### Household Management → Project Management

**What you did:** Managed household through 5 PCS moves
**Resume version:**
"Coordinated complex relocation projects including budget management, vendor selection, timeline development, and execution across multiple geographic regions"

### Diverse Jobs → Transferable Skills

**What seems scattered:**
- Retail associate
- Substitute teacher
- Bank teller
- Virtual assistant

**Reframed as skills:**
- Customer service excellence across industries
- Quick adaptation to new environments
- Financial transaction accuracy
- Administrative support and organization
