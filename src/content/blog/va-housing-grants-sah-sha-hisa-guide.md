# SAH vs SHA vs HISA: Which VA Housing Grant Do You Qualify For?

If you're a veteran with a service-connected disability, you might qualify for VA housing grants that can help you adapt your home to meet your needs. The VA offers three main grant programs - Specially Adapted Housing (SAH), Special Housing Adaptation (SHA), and Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) - each designed for different disability levels and modification needs.

Understanding which grant you qualify for and how much funding you can receive is critical for planning your home modifications. This comprehensive guide breaks down each program's eligibility requirements, grant amounts, covered modifications, and application process.

## Understanding the Three VA Housing Grant Programs

The VA provides housing grants to help veterans with service-connected disabilities live independently in barrier-free homes. Each program serves different disability levels and modification needs:

**SAH (Specially Adapted Housing)**: The largest grant for veterans with the most severe service-connected disabilities requiring major home modifications.

**SHA (Special Housing Adaptation)**: A mid-tier grant for veterans with specific service-connected disabilities needing less extensive modifications.

**HISA (Home Improvements and Structural Alterations)**: A smaller grant for minor modifications to improve accessibility and safety.

## SAH (Specially Adapted Housing) Grant

### Grant Amount

**Up to $115,956** (2024 fiscal year)

The SAH grant provides the most substantial funding because it's designed for veterans with severe service-connected disabilities requiring significant home modifications.

### Who Qualifies for SAH

You must have a service-connected disability that meets one of these criteria:

**Loss or Loss of Use of Both Lower Extremities**
Veterans who have lost both legs or cannot use both legs due to service-connected injuries. This includes:

## Grant Comparison Chart

| Feature | SAH | SHA | HISA |
|---------|-----|-----|------|
| **Maximum Amount** | $115,956 | $23,444 | $6,800 |
| **Disability Severity** | Most severe | Moderate to severe | Any service-connected |
| **Modification Scope** | Major structural | Moderate adaptation | Minor improvements |
| **Wheelchair Access** | Full home accessibility | Limited accessibility | Basic features |
| **Room Additions** | Yes | No | No |
| **Processing Time** | 3-6 months | 2-4 months | 1-2 months |
| **Can Use Multiple Times** | Up to 3 uses (lifetime) | Up to 3 uses (lifetime) | One-time (lifetime) |

## Can You Use Multiple Grants?

**SAH and SHA**: Each grant can be used up to three times in your lifetime, but the total cannot exceed the maximum grant amount. For example, if you use $50,000 of your SAH grant, you still have $65,956 remaining that can be used in subsequent uses.

**HISA**: This is a one-time lifetime grant. Once you've used your $6,800, it's not renewable.

**Using Different Grants**: You can potentially qualify for HISA in addition to SAH or SHA if you meet the criteria for multiple programs. However, you cannot use both SAH and SHA simultaneously.

## Application Process Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility

Review the eligibility criteria above and identify which grant(s) you might qualify for based on your service-connected disability rating.

**Required**: You must have a VA disability rating for the qualifying condition. If you haven't filed for VA disability yet, do that first.

### Step 2: Gather Required Documentation

**Medical Evidence:**
- Current VA disability rating letter
- Medical records documenting your disability
- Healthcare provider recommendations for home modifications
- Functional assessment showing need for modifications

**Property Documentation:**
- Proof of homeownership or family member ownership
- Property title or deed
- Lease agreement (if renting, for temporary modifications)

**Modification Plans:**
- Contractor estimates for proposed modifications
- Architectural drawings (for major projects)
- Detailed description of needed modifications
- Cost breakdown

### Step 3: Complete VA Form 26-4555

**VA Form 26-4555** (Application in Acquiring Specially Adapted Housing or Special Home Adaptation Grant)

Available at:
- VA.gov website (downloadable PDF)
- Regional VA office
- VA medical center
- Online submission through VA.gov

**Form Requirements:**
- Personal information and military service details
- Disability information and VA claim number
- Property information

### Step 4: Submit Your Application

**Online** (Fastest): VA.gov - upload form and supporting documents

**Mail**: Send to your regional VA office:
Department of Veterans Affairs
Regional Loan Center (use your state's RLC address)

**In-Person**: Visit your local VA regional office with completed application

### Step 5: VA Review Process

**Initial Review (2-4 weeks):**
VA reviews application for completeness and eligibility.

**Home Visit (if required):**
For SAH and SHA grants, a VA representative may visit your home to assess needed modifications.

**Medical Review:**
VA medical personnel review the medical necessity of requested modifications.

**Approval Decision (60-120 days):**
You'll receive a decision letter explaining:
- Approval or denial
- Approved grant amount
- Approved modifications
- Next steps

### Step 6: Find a Qualified Contractor

**After approval**, you need to hire a contractor to perform the work:

**Requirements:**
- Licensed and insured
- Experience with accessible home modifications
- Familiar with VA grant requirements
- Can provide itemized estimates
- References from previous accessibility projects

**CAPS Certification Recommended:**
Certified Aging-in-Place Specialists (CAPS) have training in accessibility modifications.

**VA-Experienced Contractors:**
Some contractors specialize in VA grant projects and understand the process.

**Getting Multiple Bids:**
Get at least 2-3 estimates to ensure competitive pricing.

### Step 7: Submit Contractor Proposal

Send contractor estimates and plans to VA for final approval:
- Detailed cost breakdown
- Timeline for completion
- Specific materials and modifications
- Contractor license and insurance information

### Step 8: Construction and Payment

**Two Payment Options:**

**Option 1 - Direct Payment to Contractor:**
VA can pay the contractor directly upon project completion.

**Option 2 - Reimbursement to Veteran:**
You pay the contractor, then submit receipts to VA for reimbursement.

**During Construction:**
- VA may conduct site visits
- Keep all receipts and documentation
- Document work with photos
- Maintain communication with VA representative

### Step 9: Final Inspection and Payment

**Upon Completion:**
- Final VA inspection to verify work matches approved plans
- Submit final receipts and invoices
- Receive final payment or reimbursement
- Close out the grant paperwork

## Timeline Expectations

**HISA Grant**: 1-3 months from application to approval

**SHA Grant**: 2-4 months from application to approval

**SAH Grant**: 3-6 months from application to approval

**Construction Time**: Varies based on scope of work (1-6 months typical)

**Total Process**: Expect 4-12 months from application to project completion for major grants.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Starting Work Before Approval

**The Problem**: Veterans sometimes begin modifications before receiving VA approval, expecting reimbursement.

**Why It Fails**: The VA only reimburses pre-approved modifications. Starting early can result in denial of payment.

**Solution**: Wait for full VA approval before beginning any work. The only exception is emergency modifications, which require special VA authorization.

### Mistake 2: Insufficient Contractor Estimates

**The Problem**: Submitting vague or incomplete contractor estimates.

**Why It Fails**: VA needs detailed, itemized estimates showing specific work and costs. Generic estimates get rejected.

**Solution**: Ensure contractor provides:
- Itemized list of all modifications
- Material specifications
- Labor costs broken down by task
- Timeline for completion
- Contractor licensing information

### Mistake 3: Not Documenting Medical Necessity

**The Problem**: Failing to clearly connect requested modifications to specific disability needs.

**Why It Fails**: VA must see clear medical necessity for each modification.

**Solution**: Get a detailed letter from your VA healthcare provider explaining:
- Your specific functional limitations
- How each requested modification addresses those limitations
- Why the modifications are medically necessary
- How modifications will improve your independence

### Mistake 4: Choosing the Wrong Grant

**The Problem**: Applying for HISA when you qualify for SHA, or SHA when you qualify for SAH.

**Why It Fails**: You receive less funding than you're entitled to, potentially leaving critical modifications unfunded.

**Solution**: Review eligibility criteria carefully. If you have qualifying disabilities for multiple grants, apply for the largest one you're eligible for. Consult with a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) if unsure.

### Mistake 5: Incomplete Property Documentation

**The Problem**: Not providing clear proof of property ownership or legal right to modify.

**Why It Fails**: VA requires proof you own the property or have legal permission to modify it.

**Solution**: Provide:
- Property deed or title
- Mortgage documents
- If modifying a family member's home: signed letter from owner granting permission
- For planned home purchases: purchase agreement and financing approval

### Mistake 6: Not Using Available Resources

**The Problem**: Trying to navigate the application process alone without support.

**Why It Fails**: The grant process is complex, and veterans miss opportunities for assistance and advocacy.

**Solution**: Connect with:
- **Veterans Service Officers (VSO)**: Free help with applications
- **VA Social Workers**: Guidance on available programs
- **Disabled American Veterans (DAV)**: Application assistance
- **State Veteran Affairs Offices**: Additional state-level programs

### Mistake 7: Exceeding Grant Limits

**The Problem**: Planning modifications that cost significantly more than the grant covers without a plan for the difference.

**Why It Fails**: VA only covers up to the grant maximum. If your modifications cost $150,000 but you have a SHA grant ($23,444), you need funding for the remaining $126,556.

**Solution**:
- Plan modifications that fit within grant limits
- Explore additional funding sources: state veterans programs, nonprofit grants, personal financing
- Prioritize essential modifications first
- Consider phased construction if using grant multiple times

## Additional Resources and Funding

### State Veteran Programs

Many states offer additional funding for home modifications:

**California**: California Department of Veterans Affairs housing assistance

**Texas**: Texas Veterans Land Board housing assistance

**Florida**: Florida Department of Veterans Affairs housing programs

**New York**: NYS Division of Veterans' Services housing programs

Research your state's veteran affairs office for additional programs.

### Nonprofit Organizations

**Rebuilding Together**: Provides home modification assistance for veterans

**Homes For Our Troops**: Builds specially adapted homes for severely injured veterans

**Purple Heart Homes**: Provides housing modifications for disabled veterans

**Gary Sinise Foundation**: R.I.S.E. program builds smart homes for severely wounded veterans

### Combined Funding Strategies

Many veterans successfully combine multiple funding sources:

**Example**: Marine veteran with SAH grant ($115,956) + California state grant ($15,000) + Purple Heart Homes assistance ($10,000) = $140,956 total funding for comprehensive home adaptation.

## Tax Benefits

**Home Modifications for Medical Purposes**: May be tax-deductible as medical expenses. Consult a tax professional about:
- Deducting modification costs exceeding VA grant amounts
- Medical expense deductions on federal taxes
- State tax benefits for disability-related home improvements

**Grant Money**: VA grant money itself is not taxable income.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use the grant for a home I'm planning to purchase?**
A: Yes. You can use SAH or SHA grants toward purchasing a home that already has adaptive features or to modify a home you're purchasing.

**Q: What if I'm renting?**
A: You can use HISA for temporary modifications in a rental property. SAH and SHA are generally for homes you own, but exceptions exist for family members' homes.

**Q: Can I use the grant more than once?**
A: SAH and SHA can be used up to three times (lifetime), but the total cannot exceed the maximum grant amount. HISA is one-time only.

**Q: How long do I have to complete the modifications?**
A: Typically, you must complete approved modifications within a reasonable timeframe (usually 12-24 months). Extensions are possible with VA approval.

**Q: Can I get pre-approved before finding a contractor?**
A: Yes. Apply for eligibility determination first, then work with contractors after you know you're approved.

**Q: What if my contractor's estimate exceeds the grant amount?**
A: You're responsible for costs exceeding the grant. Options include: modifying plans to reduce costs, finding additional funding sources, or paying the difference yourself.

**Q: Do I need to repay the grant if I sell my home?**
A: No. These are grants, not loans. You don't repay them, even if you sell the home.
