# Colorado Military Retirement: Best Cities, Housing Costs & Quality of Life

Colorado ranks among the most desirable states for military retirees thanks to outdoor recreation, four-season climate, strong military community, and booming defense industry. With approximately 332,000 veterans calling Colorado home, the state offers diverse living options from mountain towns to Front Range cities to plains communities.

But where should you actually live? Colorado's cities vary dramatically in housing costs (Denver metro is expensive), altitude (respiratory concerns), veteran population density, job opportunities, and access to VA healthcare.

## Climate and Altitude Considerations

### Front Range Cities (5,000-6,000 feet)

**Denver** (5,280 feet), **Colorado Springs** (6,035 feet), **Fort Collins** (5,000 feet), **Boulder** (5,430 feet)

- **Summers**: Warm to hot (80-95°F), low humidity
- **Winters**: Cold (20-40°F), snow, dry
- **Sunshine**: 300 days/year
- **Altitude concerns**: Moderate - veterans with respiratory/cardiovascular conditions should consult doctors

**Study finding**: 45% of veterans experienced mild acute mountain sickness at 2,500m (~8,200 feet). Front Range cities at 5,000-6,000 feet are lower but still concerning for vulnerable veterans.

### Western Slope (4,500-5,000 feet)

**Grand Junction** (4,586 feet), **Pueblo** (4,695 feet)

- **Summers**: Hot (90-100°F+)
- **Winters**: Milder than Front Range
- **Lower altitude** - better for respiratory issues
- **Best choice for veterans with altitude concerns**

### Mountain Towns (7,000-10,000+ feet)

**Avoid** if you have respiratory or cardiovascular conditions:
- Breckenridge (9,600 feet)
- Vail (8,150 feet)
- Aspen (7,900 feet)

These elevations are dangerous for veterans with COPD, heart disease, or pulmonary hypertension.

### Veteran Health Considerations

**Altitude concerns for**:
- COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Heart failure
- Sleep apnea
- Asthma

**Research**: Study of veterans exposed to 8,200 feet showed oxygen levels decreased and pulmonary artery pressure increased 43%. Most tolerated altitude well, but at-risk veterans struggled.

**Recommendation**: If you have respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, choose:
1. **Grand Junction** (4,586 feet - lowest)
2. **Pueblo** (4,695 feet)
3. Consider **Arizona** or **Texas** instead (near sea level)

**VA pulmonary medicine**: Rocky Mountain Regional VA has specialized team for altitude-related complications.

## Veteran Community Strength

### Cities with Strongest Military Community

3. **Fort Collins**: 20,000+ veterans (CSU student veteran community)
4. **Pueblo**: Moderate veteran population

### VFW and American Legion Posts
