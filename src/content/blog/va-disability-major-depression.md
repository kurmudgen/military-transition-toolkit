## Understanding Major Depression VA Ratings

Major Depressive Disorder is rated under 38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434 (Major Depressive Disorder) or can be rated under the general mental health rating formula. The VA evaluates depression based on symptom severity and functional impairment across occupational, social, and self-care domains.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 0% Rating
**Criteria:** A mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Diagnosed depression but symptoms are minimal or in remission
- No medication required or only as-needed use
- Full-time employment without issues
- Normal social functioning
- No impairment in daily activities
- Past history but currently asymptomatic

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Mild depressive symptoms managed with medication
- Occasional low mood or lack of motivation
- Minor concentration difficulties during stress
- Can maintain employment with minimal difficulty
- Social life generally intact
- Daily medication keeps symptoms controlled
- Minimal impact on daily functioning

#### 30% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss.

## Claim Strategy

### Initial Claim Strategy

**1. Establish Diagnosis First**
- Begin treatment if not already in care
- Get formal Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis
- Attend appointments regularly
- Be honest about symptom severity with providers

**2. Determine Connection to Service**
- **Direct:** Review service medical records for depression symptoms during service
- **Secondary:** Identify primary service-connected condition causing depression (PTSD, chronic pain, TBI, etc.)
- **Aggravation:** Show pre-service depression was worsened by service

**3. Obtain Nexus Opinion**
- Ask treating psychiatrist/psychologist for nexus letter
- Provide provider with service records and timeline
- If VA denies, consider Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)

**4. Document Functional Impact**
- Personal statement with specific examples
- Lay statements from family/friends
- Employment records
- Treatment records showing severity

**5. File Comprehensively**
Submit:
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Medical records with MDD diagnosis
- Service records (if direct service connection)
- Nexus letter
- Personal statement
- Lay statements
- Employment records
- Mental Health DBQ (if available)

### Secondary Claim Strategy

Depression secondary to another condition is extremely common and often easier to prove than direct service connection.

**Common Primary Conditions Causing Secondary Depression:**
- PTSD (very common)
- Chronic pain conditions
- TBI
- Sleep apnea
- Tinnitus (with life impact)
- Paralysis or amputation
- Chronic illness (diabetes, heart disease)

**Secondary Claim Requirements:**
1. Primary condition must be service-connected
2. Current MDD diagnosis
3. Medical opinion that depression is caused or aggravated by primary condition
4. Temporal relationship (depression onset after primary condition)

**Example Nexus Statement:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's Major Depressive Disorder is caused by their service-connected PTSD [or chronic pain, TBI, etc.]. The chronic stress, sleep disturbance, and functional limitations from [primary condition] are well-established risk factors for depression. The temporal relationship supports causation, as the veteran's depression began after the onset of [primary condition]."

### Increase Rating Strategy

**When to File for Increase:**
- Symptoms have worsened significantly
- Functional impairment has increased
- You have 6+ months of new evidence showing deterioration

**Evidence for Increase:**
- Updated treatment records
- Medication changes/increases
- New or increased hospitalizations
- Job loss or inability to work
- Relationship breakdowns
- Decline in self-care
- Updated personal and lay statements
- New Mental Health DBQ

### Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU)

If depression prevents you from working but you're rated less than 100%, you may qualify for TDIU, which pays at 100% rate.

**TDIU Requirements:**
- One condition at 60%, OR
- Multiple conditions totaling 70% with one at 40%
- Unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities

**TDIU Evidence:**
- Employment history showing inability to maintain work
- Termination records citing performance/attendance
- Medical opinions stating inability to work
- Vocational rehabilitation records showing failed attempts

**File:** VA Form 21-8940 (Application for TDIU)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability for depression if I already have PTSD?
Yes. Depression can be rated separately from PTSD if the symptoms are distinct. However, it's more commonly filed as a secondary condition to PTSD since they often occur together.

### How is depression rated differently from PTSD?
They use the same general rating criteria under the mental health rating schedule. The key is documenting which symptoms come from which condition. Often they overlap significantly.

### Can I get 100% for depression alone?
Yes, if your depression symptoms meet the 100% criteria for total occupational and social impairment. This typically requires severe symptoms like persistent suicidal ideation, inability to care for self, and possible psychiatric hospitalizations.

### Will VA reduce my depression rating if I improve?
Ratings can be reduced if your condition improves. However, continue treatment and document ongoing symptoms. Mental health ratings are often protected after 20 years or if you're over 55.

### How long does a depression claim take?
Initial claims average 130-180 days. Secondary claims may be faster. Complex cases or appeals can take 1-3 years.

### Do I need to be suicidal to get a high rating?
No, but suicidal ideation is mentioned specifically in the 70% rating criteria. Other severe symptoms can also warrant high ratings: inability to work, severe social impairment, neglect of hygiene, etc.

### Can I work and still get VA disability for depression?
Yes, unless you're claiming unemployability (TDIU). However, your ability to work affects your rating since severe ratings require significant occupational impairment.

### What if my depression is from medication side effects?
Depression caused by medication for a service-connected condition can be rated as secondary to that condition.

### Should I see a psychiatrist or psychologist?
Either can diagnose and treat depression. Psychiatrists can prescribe medication. Both can provide nexus opinions. Use whomever you're comfortable with and can access.

### What if VA says my depression is not service-connected?
Appeal with additional evidence. Get an Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) from a private expert. Consider secondary service connection to another rated condition. Use a VSO or attorney for help.

### Does depression count toward getting TDIU?
Yes. Mental health conditions are one of the most common reasons veterans qualify for TDIU. Depression preventing employment is strong evidence for TDIU.

### Will antidepressants help or hurt my claim?
Taking medications shows you're seeking treatment and your condition requires continuous medication (relevant to ratings). Never stop taking prescribed medications to try to worsen your rating - this is dangerous and unethical.

### Can I get VA disability for depression from military sexual trauma?
Yes. Depression is a common response to MST. File with personal statement, behavioral markers, and current treatment records. VA gives special consideration to MST-related claims.

### What if my private doctor says I can't work but VA says I can?
Private medical opinions are given equal weight to VA opinions. Submit your private doctor's opinion. If denied, appeal and consider getting an Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) from a specialist.

## Final Thoughts

Major Depressive Disorder is a serious, often debilitating condition that affects many veterans. If your depression is related to your military service or a service-connected condition, you deserve compensation and comprehensive treatment.

**Keys to a Successful Depression Claim:**

1. **Seek treatment immediately** - Both for your health and to document your condition
2. **Be honest about severity** - Don't minimize symptoms to appear strong
3. **Document functional impact** - Show specifically how depression affects work, relationships, and daily life
4. **Consider secondary connection** - Often easier to prove than direct service connection
5. **Don't give up** - Many successful claims are approved on appeal
6. **Get help** - Use VSOs, attorneys, or accredited agents when needed

**Remember:** Depression is not a weakness. It's a medical condition that can be treated. Seeking help and filing for benefits you earned is a sign of strength, not weakness.
