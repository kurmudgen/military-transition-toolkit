## Resume Translation: Military to Civilian Language

Stop writing "89B" on your resume. Civilian HR doesn't know what that means, and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) will reject your application. Translate your experience:

### Instead of This (Military Language):

**"89B Ammunition Specialist, Alpha Company, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 2019-2024"**
- Performed ammunition handling operations
- Conducted inspections and surveillance
- Operated forklifts and material handling equipment
- Maintained ammunition accountability
- Supported deployment operations

### Write This (Civilian-Friendly Language):

**"Warehouse Operations Specialist / Material Handler, U.S. Army, 2019-2024"**

1. **Operated forklifts and material handling equipment** moving up to 25 tons daily in high-hazard warehouse environment, maintaining zero safety incidents over 5 years while handling explosives and sensitive materials.

2. **Conducted quality inspections on 5,000+ items monthly**, identifying defects, damage, and safety issues using systematic visual inspection procedures, documenting findings, and coordinating corrective actions achieving 99.5% accuracy rate.

3. **Managed warehouse operations** for 800-person organization, receiving/issuing/storing materials worth $15M, coordinating with transportation teams, and maintaining 100% inventory accountability during high-volume operations.

4. **Loaded aircraft and vehicles** with precision cargo placement, weight distribution calculations, and tie-down procedures, completing 150+ loading operations including international shipments with zero damage incidents.

5. **Prepared hazardous materials shipments** in compliance with DOT regulations, completing shipping documentation, applying proper labels/placards, and coordinating with transportation carriers for 200+ shipments annually.

6. **Led 4-person warehouse team** during peak operations, training new employees on safety protocols, equipment operation, and quality standards, improving productivity by 20% while maintaining zero lost-time accidents.

7. **Maintained physical security** for high-value storage facility, controlling access for 150+ personnel, conducting daily inspections, and ensuring 100% compliance with stringent security protocols.

8. **Performed equipment maintenance** on forklifts, pallet jacks, and material handling equipment, conducting preventive maintenance, troubleshooting issues, and coordinating repairs minimizing downtime.

9. **Processed 300+ shipping/receiving transactions monthly** using automated inventory systems, verifying documentation accuracy, updating database records, and maintaining audit trails achieving 99.8% data accuracy.

10. **Achieved zero safety incidents** over 5 years while handling Class 1 explosives and hazardous materials in warehouse operations supporting combat deployments, demonstrating strict adherence to safety protocols and risk management.

### Key Resume Strategies:

**Use civilian job titles:** "Warehouse Operations Specialist," "Material Handler," "Cargo Specialist," "Quality Control Inspector" instead of "89B" or "Ammunition Specialist."

**Quantify everything:** "$15M inventory," "5,000+ inspections monthly," "150+ loading operations," "200+ shipments," "25 tons daily," "800-person organization," "99.5% accuracy," "zero incidents."

**Translate terminology:**
- "Ammunition supply point (ASP)" = "warehouse" or "distribution center"
- "Issue/turn-in" = "ship/receive"
- "Class V" = "materials" or "products" (or "ammunition" if applying to defense contractors)
- "DODIC/NSN" = "product identifier" or "SKU"
- "Lot number" = "batch number" or "product tracking code"
- "Surveillance inspection" = "quality inspection" or "quality assurance"

**Emphasize transferable skills:** Forklift operation, warehouse operations, quality inspection, hazardous materials handling, inventory management, team leadership, safety compliance, attention to detail.

**Tailor to job description:** Mirror keywords from job posting. If posting says "material handling equipment," use that phrase. If it mentions "inventory accuracy," include that specific term.

**Include technical skills section:**
- Forklift operation (sit-down, stand-up, reach truck, order picker)
- Material handling equipment (pallet jacks, hand trucks, loaders)
- Warehouse management systems (translate SAAS-MOD/TAMMIS to "inventory management software")
- Microsoft Office (Excel for inventory tracking, Word for documentation)
- Quality inspection and defect identification
- Hazardous materials handling (DOT, OSHA compliance)
- Cargo loading and securing
- Physical inventory and cycle counting

**For ammunition plant / defense contractor applications:** You CAN use "ammunition" and be specific about ordnance experience. These employers want to see: "Handled conventional ammunition including artillery, mortar, small arms, and demolition explosives," "Conducted ammunition inspections identifying defects and serviceability," "Performed demilitarization operations."

- Glassdoor reviews (employee perspectives)
- LinkedIn profiles of interviewers if known

**Practice STAR method:** Situation, Task, Action, Result

Example: "Tell me about a time you worked safely in a dangerous environment."
- **Situation:** Working in ammunition storage area with Class 1 explosives requiring strict safety protocols
- **Task:** Complete daily warehouse operations while ensuring zero safety incidents
- **Action:** Followed all safety procedures, conducted pre-operational equipment checks, maintained situational awareness, immediately reported safety concerns
- **Result:** Achieved zero safety incidents over 5 years handling explosives, contributing to unit's perfect safety record

**Questions to ask interviewer:**
- "What does success look like in this role in the first 90 days?"
- "What are biggest challenges facing the team?"
- "What opportunities exist for advancement?"
- "Can you describe the team structure?"
- "What do you enjoy about working here?"

**Dress code:**
- Warehouse/material handler roles: Business casual for interview (khakis, collared shirt—no jeans)
- Corporate office roles: Business professional
- Quality control: Business casual to business professional

**Common mistakes:**
- Too much military jargon
- Speaking negatively about military/leadership
- Not researching company
- Not preparing questions
- Arriving late (arrive 10-15 minutes early)

### Salary Negotiation

**When to negotiate:** After receiving written offer, when offer is below market rate for position/location.

**How to negotiate:**
- Research market rates (Glassdoor, Indeed, PayScale)
- Present data professionally: "Based on market research for [position] in [location], comparable roles pay $X-$Y. Given my forklift experience and quality inspection skills, I was hoping for $Z."
- Consider total compensation (health insurance costs, 401(k) match, shift differentials, overtime potential)

**What's negotiable:**
- Base salary (most common)
- Sign-on bonus (easier for companies than raising base)
- Start date
- Shift assignment (day vs. night if flexible)

**What's typically not negotiable:**
- Federal GS salaries (set by pay scale)
- Union positions (wages set by contract)
- Entry-level hourly positions at large employers

## Interview Preparation: Questions and Answers for 89Bs

### Behavioral Questions (Use STAR Method)

**1. Tell me about a time you identified and solved a safety issue.**

Strong answer: "While conducting daily warehouse inspections in our ammunition storage area, I noticed a forklift with damaged forks that hadn't been tagged out. I immediately removed it from service, reported it to my supervisor, and coordinated with maintenance for repair. I also briefed the team during our safety meeting to emphasize the importance of equipment inspections. Result: We prevented potential safety incident and reinforced our safety culture, maintaining our zero-accident record."

**2. Describe a situation where you worked under time pressure.**

Strong answer: "During pre-deployment preparations, we received orders to prepare and load 50 tons of ammunition onto aircraft within 24 hours—half the normal timeline. I coordinated with my team, prioritized critical items, staged materials for efficient loading, and we worked rotating 8-hour shifts. I personally verified every load calculation and tie-down. We completed the mission in 22 hours with zero errors, enabling on-time deployment."

**3. Give an example of working effectively in a team.**

Strong answer: "During a major inventory requiring physical count of 8,000 items over one week, I worked with a 5-person team. We divided the warehouse into zones, cross-checked each other's counts for accuracy, and maintained positive morale during long hours. I took initiative to train newer team members on proper counting procedures. We completed the inventory 2 days early with 99.9% accuracy, earning commendation from leadership."

**4. Tell me about a time you made a mistake. How did you handle it?**

Strong answer (honest but focus on resolution): "Early in my career, I didn't properly document a forklift pre-operational inspection before starting work. My supervisor caught it immediately. I acknowledged the error, completed the inspection properly, and implemented a personal checklist to prevent recurrence. I haven't missed a required inspection since, and I now mentor new team members on the importance of documentation."

**5. Describe how you maintained quality standards in your work.**

Strong answer: "As an ammunition inspector, I conducted visual inspections on hundreds of items daily looking for defects, corrosion, or damage. I used systematic inspection procedures—checking condition codes, lot numbers, packaging integrity, and physical condition. When I identified issues, I immediately documented findings, quarantined affected items, and notified leadership. My thoroughness resulted in zero instances of defective ammunition being issued during my time in the unit."

### Technical/Skills-Based Questions

**6. What experience do you have operating forklifts and material handling equipment?**

Strong answer: "I operated forklifts daily for 5 years in military warehouse operations, including sit-down forklifts (up to 10,000 lb capacity), stand-up forklifts, pallet jacks, and specialized ammunition handling equipment. I'm trained on pre-operational inspections, load capacity calculations, safe operation in congested areas, and proper stacking procedures. I maintained zero accidents and zero equipment damage incidents over my entire career. I understand OSHA requirements and can quickly certify on your specific equipment."

**7. Tell me about your experience with quality inspection.**

Strong answer: "I conducted quality inspections daily on ammunition and explosives, identifying defects, corrosion, damage, and safety issues. I inspected packaging, verified lot numbers and nomenclature, assessed physical condition, and documented findings using standardized forms. My inspections had to be 100% accurate since missing a defect could cause casualties. I maintained 99.5% inspection accuracy over my career. This systematic approach to quality inspection translates directly to manufacturing quality control."

**8. How do you handle repetitive physical work?**

Strong answer: "In the Army, I routinely lifted and moved heavy ammunition, often 50-80 lbs, for 8-10 hour shifts in all weather conditions. I understand proper lifting techniques, the importance of pacing yourself, staying hydrated, and using mechanical assistance when appropriate. I'm accustomed to shift work including nights and weekends. Physical work doesn't bother me—I actually prefer staying active rather than sitting at a desk."

**9. What do you know about hazardous materials handling?**

Strong answer: "I handled Class 1 explosives daily, which are the most strictly regulated hazardous materials. I'm trained on DOT transportation requirements, proper storage and compatibility, labeling and placarding, shipping documentation, emergency procedures, and safety protocols. I understand the serious consequences of HAZMAT non-compliance. I completed military HAZMAT training equivalent to OSHA HAZWOPER and maintained zero incidents over my career."

**10. How comfortable are you with computer systems and data entry?**

Strong answer (be honest about skill level): "I used military inventory management systems daily to process transactions, update records, and track materials. I'm proficient with basic computer skills including data entry, navigating databases, and using Microsoft Excel for inventory tracking. I'm a quick learner with new systems—in my last position, I became the go-to person for troubleshooting system issues. I understand the importance of data accuracy since inventory records drive operations."

### Situational/Hypothetical Questions

**11. How would you respond if you noticed a coworker violating a safety procedure?**

Strong answer: "Safety is non-negotiable, especially in warehouse environments with forklifts, heavy materials, and potential hazards. I would immediately and respectfully address the issue with the coworker, explaining the safety concern. If it continued, I would report it to my supervisor—not to get anyone in trouble, but because safety violations put everyone at risk. In the military, we had a culture where anyone could stop operations for safety concerns, and I believe that's the right approach in any workplace."

**12. What would you do if you discovered damaged products during inspection?**

Strong answer: "First, I'd quarantine the damaged items to prevent them from being shipped to customers. Second, I'd document what I found including the extent of damage, lot numbers, and circumstances. Third, I'd notify my supervisor immediately. Fourth, I'd follow company procedures for disposition—whether items can be repaired, need to be scrapped, or require investigation to prevent recurrence. The key is identifying and addressing quality issues before they reach customers."

**13. How do you prioritize when you have multiple urgent tasks?**

Strong answer: "I'd assess each task's urgency and impact, communicate with my supervisor if priorities conflict, and focus on mission-critical items first. In the Army, I regularly managed competing priorities—urgent material requests, scheduled inspections, and routine operations simultaneously. I stayed organized, communicated clearly about realistic timelines, and remained flexible when priorities changed. If I can't complete everything, I make sure leadership knows so they can allocate resources appropriately."

### Questions About Military Background

**14. Why are you leaving the military?**

Strong answer (be positive): "I'm proud of my Army service and the skills I developed, but I'm ready to transition to civilian life and build a long-term career in logistics and warehouse operations. I want stability, the ability to put down roots, and opportunities to advance based on performance. I'm excited to apply my warehouse experience, safety mindset, and work ethic in the civilian sector."

Avoid: Complaining about military, discussing negative experiences, appearing uncertain.

**15. What did you do in the Army? (For non-veteran interviewers)**

Strong answer: "I was an Ammunition Specialist, which means I worked in warehouse operations handling explosives and ammunition. My job involved operating forklifts, conducting quality inspections, loading cargo, managing inventory, and enforcing strict safety protocols. The work required attention to detail, physical stamina, and reliability since mistakes could have serious consequences. It's essentially warehouse operations in a high-stakes environment."

Keep brief, use civilian terms, focus on transferable skills.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid During Transition

### 1. Applying Only to Ammunition/Defense Jobs

**The mistake:** Only applying to ammunition plant technician or defense contractor positions because "that's what I know."

**Why it's costly:** Limits opportunities to small geographic areas (ammunition plants are in rural locations) and specialized employers (fewer total positions). You're competing with thousands of other separating 89Bs for same roles.

**The solution:** Recognize your skills transfer broadly to warehouse operations, quality control, logistics, and manufacturing. Amazon has 175 fulfillment centers nationwide vs. 10-15 ammunition plants. Expand your job search to leverage full range of skills.

**Example:** Sergeant Davis only applied to ammunition plants in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Iowa. Three months after separation, still no offers due to limited openings and high competition. When he expanded search to warehouse operations at Amazon, Target, and FedEx in his preferred location (Texas), he had 3 interviews and 2 offers within 2 weeks.

### 2. Undervaluing Your Skills and Accepting Low Offers

**The mistake:** Accepting first offer without negotiation. Believing "I just loaded ammunition" without recognizing value of forklift skills, inspection experience, safety record, and leadership.

**Why it's costly:** Leaves $3K-$8K on table annually. Starting salary impacts future raises (percentage-based).

**The solution:** Research market rates for material handler, warehouse operations, and quality inspector roles in your location using Glassdoor, Indeed, PayScale. Understand that companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Target are desperate for reliable warehouse workers and actively recruit veterans with premium pay.

**Market rates:** Material handler $38K-$48K entry level, experienced $42K-$55K. If offered $15/hour ($31,200) for experienced material handler role, negotiate to $18-$20/hour ($37,440-$41,600) using market data.

### 3. Poor Physical Presentation at Warehouse Interviews

**The mistake:** Showing up to warehouse interview in worn jeans, t-shirt with offensive graphics, or overly casual attire. Or opposite extreme—full suit for forklift operator interview.

**Why it's costly:** First impressions matter. Employers assess whether you'll represent company professionally. Too casual = unprofessional. Too formal = doesn't understand workplace culture.

**The solution:** Business casual for interviews: clean khakis or dark jeans, collared shirt (polo or button-down), clean shoes. Professional but not overly formal. Save the suit for corporate office interviews.

### 4. Expecting Military Structure in Civilian Workplace

**The mistake:** Expecting clear chain of command, immediate decisions, direct communication, and mission-focused culture. Becoming frustrated when civilian workplace operates differently.

**Why it's costly:** Damages relationships with coworkers and supervisors. Creates reputation as "inflexible veteran" who can't adapt. May lead to poor performance reviews or termination during probationary period.

**The solution:** Recognize civilian workplaces operate differently. Communication is often indirect and diplomatic. Decisions involve consensus-building. Socializing and relationships matter. Adapt your communication style, be patient, and observe norms before trying to change things.

**Adjustment tips:**
- First 90 days: Observe and learn culture before suggesting improvements
- Tone down military directness—practice diplomatic communication
- Avoid military jargon and acronyms
- Don't lead with "In the Army we did it this way..."
- Find mentor (ideally veteran who successfully transitioned)

### 5. Not Pursuing Certifications

**The mistake:** Relying solely on military experience without civilian credentials. Not using GI Bill or credentialing opportunities.

**Why it's costly:** Limits advancement opportunities. Warehouse associate roles pay $38K-$48K. Warehouse manager roles requiring APICS CPIM pay $75K-$100K. Without certifications, you're stuck at entry level competing against civilians with both experience AND education.

**The solution:** Pursue high-ROI certifications: APICS CPIM (27% salary increase, $1,680), OSHA HAZWOPER (required for HAZMAT roles, $210), Lean Six Sigma (process improvement, $1,500-$3,000). Use GI Bill for bachelor's degree in supply chain, logistics, or business.

**ROI calculations:**
- CPIM: $1,680 cost, +$15K-$25K salary = break even in 2-3 months
- Bachelor's degree: $0 with GI Bill, +$20K-$40K career earnings
- HAZWOPER: $210 cost, qualifies for $60K-$85K HAZMAT roles

### 6. Quitting First Job Too Quickly

**The mistake:** Quitting first civilian job after 2-3 months because "it's not what I expected" or frustration with adjustment.

**Why it's costly:** Job-hopping looks bad on resume. Most benefits don't vest until 1 year. You lose valuable learning experience about civilian workplace norms.

**The solution:** Commit to staying 12-18 months minimum in first civilian role unless situation is truly toxic or illegal. First job is learning experience—you're learning civilian workplace culture, not just doing the job. Use first year to observe, adapt, build relationships, and prove yourself. If you want to advance or change careers, do so strategically after establishing track record.

**Red flags warranting early departure:** Illegal activity, serious safety violations, discrimination/harassment, failure to pay wages owed. General frustration or differences from military don't justify immediate departure.

### 7. Neglecting Physical Fitness After Separation

**The mistake:** Stopping PT after separation, gaining significant weight, losing physical capability to perform warehouse work.

**Why it's costly:** Warehouse and material handler jobs are physically demanding—lifting 50+ lbs, standing 8-10 hours, working in non-climate-controlled environments. If you can't handle physical demands, you'll struggle or get injured.

**The solution:** Maintain basic physical fitness after separation. You don't need Army PT standards, but you need functional strength and endurance for physical work. Join gym, work out at home, or join Team RWB (veteran fitness organization). Most warehouse workers are NOT former military—your fitness is competitive advantage. Don't lose it.

## Success Stories: Real 89Bs Who Transitioned Successfully

### Success Story #1: Sergeant James Wilson – Amazon Operations Manager

**Military background:** 8 years Army, 89B, E-5, ammunition handler at Fort Liberty, deployment to Afghanistan managing ammunition supply point.

**Transition strategy:** Used SkillBridge last 6 months, interned at Amazon fulfillment center as material handler. Worked alongside civilian employees, learned Amazon systems, proved work ethic and reliability.

**First civilian role:** Amazon hired him immediately after SkillBridge as Warehouse Associate, $46,000 + stock options. Started on night shift, operated forklifts, conducted cycle counts, assisted with training.

**Current position (4 years later):** Operations Manager at Amazon fulfillment center, $92,000 base + bonuses + stock, managing 60-person team across multiple shifts, responsible for productivity, safety, and quality metrics.

**Advice:** "SkillBridge with Amazon was best decision. I had job before separating, no unemployment gap, and they saw my work ethic firsthand. Amazon promotes from within aggressively—I moved from warehouse associate to learning ambassador to process assistant to area manager within 3 years. Military leadership translates directly if you're willing to learn their systems. I'm now completing bachelor's degree using Amazon's Career Choice program (they pay tuition) to position myself for senior operations roles."

### Success Story #2: Specialist Maria Rodriguez – Federal QASAS Position

**Military background:** 6 years Army, 89B, E-4, ammunition specialist at Fort Bliss, specialized in inspection and surveillance operations.

**Transition strategy:** Applied to QASAS program 8 months before separation. Completed lengthy application process, passed background check and medical screening. Accepted into program.

**First civilian role:** Started QASAS training program at GS-9 ($62,000 with locality pay in Texas). Completed 14-month training at Defense Ammunition Center covering ammunition surveillance, explosive safety, logistics, and technical subjects.

**Current position (3 years later):** Quality Assurance Specialist Ammunition Surveillance (GS-11, Step 5), $85,000 with locality pay, conducting ammunition inspections at Army installations across Southwest region.

**Advice:** "QASAS program is perfect for 89Bs who want federal career doing what we know—ammunition work. The training is intensive (lots of classroom learning) but you're getting paid the whole time. Now I travel to different Army installations (30-50% travel) conducting surveillance inspections, training Soldiers, and ensuring ammunition readiness. I work 40-hour weeks, no deployments, excellent benefits, and clear path to GS-12/GS-13. I'll retire from federal service with pension and TSP. Research QASAS early—application process takes months."

### Success Story #3: Staff Sergeant David Miller – Ammunition Plant Supervisor

**Military background:** 12 years Army, 89B, E-6, ammunition NCO, multiple deployments, extensive ammunition handling experience.

**Transition strategy:** Applied to defense contractors supporting ammunition plants 10 months before retirement. Targeted Day & Zimmermann and American Ordnance. Maintained Secret clearance.

**First civilian role:** Ammunition Technician with Day & Zimmermann at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, $68,000. Performed ammunition renovation, demilitarization, and quality inspection operations.

**Current position (5 years later):** Ammunition Operations Supervisor, $98,000 + overtime + excellent union benefits, leading 15-person team performing ammunition plant operations.

**Advice:** "If you want to keep doing ammunition work with better pay and no military BS, defense contractor at ammunition plant is the move. I work with other veterans doing the same job we did in uniform—but no PT, no formations, no field problems, no deployments. It's union job so excellent benefits, job security, clear advancement. Only downside is location—McAlester, Oklahoma isn't exactly a major city. But cost of living is dirt cheap, bought nice house for $180K, and my salary goes far. I'll work here until retirement collecting pension from both Army and union."

## Final Thoughts

Your 89B experience is valuable. You didn't just "load bullets"—you operated heavy equipment in high-hazard environments with zero margin for error, conducted systematic quality inspections where missing a defect could cause casualties, led teams under pressure during combat operations, and maintained safety standards that exceed civilian workplace requirements.

The civilian warehouse, logistics, and manufacturing industries desperately need exactly what you bring: reliability, safety consciousness, attention to detail, physical capability, and proven performance under pressure.

You're not starting from zero. You have 4-6-8+ years of directly relevant experience operating forklifts, handling materials, conducting inspections, and working in team-based operations. You're competing with civilians who've never worked in environments requiring your level of accountability.

First-year salaries of $42K-$58K in warehouse operations are realistic and achievable immediately. Ammunition plant technician positions paying $65K-$85K actively recruit 89Bs. Federal QASAS positions offer $78K-$115K+ with training provided and excellent benefits. Within 3-5 years, warehouse management and operations roles paying $75K-$105K are achievable with certifications and proven performance.

Start your transition 6-12 months early. Build your resume, pursue relevant certifications (forklift, HAZWOPER, APICS), network with other 89Bs who transitioned successfully, and apply broadly. Use SkillBridge if eligible—it's the fastest path to employment. Consider QASAS if you want federal career doing ammunition work.

Companies like Amazon, Walmart, FedEx, Target, and defense contractors actively recruit veterans for warehouse operations. They need your work ethic, leadership, and reliability.
