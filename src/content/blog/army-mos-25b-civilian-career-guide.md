## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 25B Information Technology Specialists—you've been maintaining mission-critical networks, troubleshooting systems under pressure, and keeping communications running in conditions most IT professionals can't imagine. Your **hands-on experience with network administration, system configuration, cybersecurity implementation, hardware/software troubleshooting, Active Directory management, and security clearance** make you exactly what the civilian IT market needs right now. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$58,000-$80,000** in help desk or junior system administrator roles, scaling to **$90,000-$130,000** as a network engineer or systems administrator with certifications, and **$120,000-$180,000+** in cloud engineering, DevOps, or cybersecurity specialist positions. With your security clearance active, add another **$20,000-$40,000** to these ranges for defense contractor roles. The IT field is projected to grow 13% through 2030—faster than average—and companies are actively recruiting veterans with your technical foundation and clearance.

Your transition timing matters. The civilian IT world is hungry for professionals who can handle pressure, think critically, and troubleshoot complex systems—skills you've proven every day as a 25B. You're not starting from scratch; you're bringing 2-6 years of practical experience that translates directly into network administration, systems engineering, cloud operations, and cybersecurity roles. The key is translating your military experience into civilian language, stacking the right certifications, and targeting companies that value what you've already accomplished.

The demand is real. From defense contractors like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin to tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft, from federal agencies to Fortune 500 companies—everyone needs skilled IT professionals. With Security+, CCNA, or cloud certifications, you'll be competitive for mid-level roles immediately. Skip the entry-level help desk grind if you leverage your experience correctly. Your clearance alone opens doors to six-figure contractor positions that civilians without military backgrounds can't access.

## What Does an Army 25B Information Technology Specialist Actually Do?

As a 25B, you've been the backbone of Army communications and IT infrastructure. You installed, maintained, and troubleshot network systems, servers, and end-user devices in field and garrison environments. Your days involved configuring routers and switches, managing Active Directory accounts, implementing cybersecurity protocols, troubleshooting hardware and software issues, maintaining network operations centers (NOCs), and ensuring mission-critical systems stayed operational 24/7. You worked with Windows and Linux servers, managed VoIP systems, configured firewalls, ran cable, maintained inventory accountability, and provided technical support to units from squad level to brigade headquarters.

Unlike civilian IT specialists who work in climate-controlled data centers with vendor support on speed dial, you troubleshot systems in tactical environments—dusty FOBs, remote field sites, convoy operations, and deployment scenarios where "call the help desk" wasn't an option. You diagnosed problems with limited resources, improvised solutions, maintained operational security, and kept commanders connected when lives depended on reliable communications. That combination of technical competence and operational resilience is exactly what sets you apart in the civilian market.

**Companies actively hiring:**
Literally every company with computers. Help desk roles are everywhere—corporate IT departments, managed service providers, government agencies, schools, hospitals, retail companies, manufacturers. High turnover means constant openings.

**Reality check:**
Help desk is the lowest-paid IT role and often soul-crushing (repetitive issues, frustrated users, "did you try rebooting?"). However, it's the easiest entry point if you need a job immediately. DO NOT settle here if you have 2+ years as a 25B. You're overqualified. Target network administrator or systems administrator roles instead. If you must start help desk for immediate income, plan your exit to a better role within 6-12 months. Don't let employers trap you there with "we need you on the help desk" excuses. Your military experience is worth more.

**Best for:** 25Bs who need immediate employment, prefer working directly with end users, or are transitioning to IT from another MOS and need to build credentials.

### 6. Federal IT Positions (Stability + Benefits)

**Civilian job titles:**

Add 17-46% locality pay depending on location (DC area is 35-46% higher).

**What translates directly:**
Everything. Federal IT positions are designed for people with your background. Veteran preference gives you significant hiring advantages (5 or 10 points added to your application score). Your clearance, military IT experience, and understanding of DoD/federal IT requirements make you ideal candidates.

**Certifications needed:**
- **CompTIA Security+** → Required for most federal IT positions under DoD 8570
- **IAT Level II or IAT Level III certs** → Depends on role (Security+, CySA+, CISSP, etc.)

**Reality check:**
Federal civilian positions offer unbeatable job security, excellent benefits (pension, healthcare, paid leave), and work-life balance. The pay is moderate compared to private sector tech companies but competitive when you factor in benefits, pension, and locality adjustments. Hiring is SLOW—6-12 months is normal. The GS system means predictable raises and clear career progression. You won't get rich, but you'll have stability. Use USAJobs.gov and understand veteran preference rules.

**Best for:** 25Bs who value stability, benefits, and work-life balance over maximizing salary, prefer working for mission-oriented organizations, and want long-term career security.

### 7. Defense Contractor IT Positions (Clearance = Money)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Network Engineer (cleared)
- Systems Administrator (cleared)

- **Mid-level (Secret clearance):** $90,000-$120,000
- **Senior (TS/SCI clearance):** $110,000-$160,000+
- **Specialized (TS/SCI + poly):** $130,000-$200,000+

**What translates directly:**
Your clearance is worth $20K-$40K in additional salary. Defense contractors need IT professionals who understand military networks, can work on government systems, and hold active clearances. Your 25B experience is exactly what they want—you already know the systems, the security requirements, and the mission.

**Certifications needed:**
- **CompTIA Security+** (required for DoD 8570 compliance)
- **CCNA or relevant technical certs** (depends on role)

**Companies actively hiring:**
Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, General Dynamics, L3Harris, BAE Systems, CACI International, Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, ManTech, Peraton, SAIC, GDIT (General Dynamics IT), Accenture Federal, Deloitte, KPMG Government, hundreds of smaller defense contractors.

**Reality check:**
Defense contracting pays significantly more than equivalent civilian IT roles because of clearance requirements. If your clearance is active or recently expired (within 2 years), you're immediately valuable. Contractors work on military bases, in government facilities, or in contractor offices supporting government systems. The work is stable (government contracts last years), but you're not a government employee—benefits vary by company. If you keep your clearance active, you'll always be employable. ClearanceJobs.com is the job board for these positions.

**Best for:** 25Bs with active clearances who want to maximize salary while continuing to support military/government missions and prefer working with familiar systems and environments.

## Transition Timeline: Your 6-12 Month Roadmap

Here's your step-by-step plan for transitioning from 25B to civilian IT career:

### 6-12 Months Before Separation:

**Month 1-2: Assessment and Planning**
- Document your clearance level and expiration date (critical for contractor jobs)
- Get 10 certified copies of DD-214 (you'll need these for applications)
- List every system, tool, and technology you've worked with as a 25B
- Research 5-7 specific job titles that interest you (network engineer, systems admin, cloud engineer, etc.)
- Join LinkedIn, connect with 50+ IT professionals and veterans in your target roles
- Register for SkillBridge if eligible (last 180 days—work civilian IT job while still on active duty)

**Month 3-4: Certification Focused**
- **Primary focus:** Get CompTIA Security+ (required for DoD contractors, valued everywhere else)
  - Study resources: Professor Messer (free YouTube), practice tests, Army COOL funding
  - Schedule exam, budget 2-3 weeks of study
- **Secondary focus:** Start CCNA study (longer timeline, highest ROI for 25Bs)
  - Use GI Bill for boot camp training if desired, or self-study with books/videos
  - Schedule exam for month 5-6

**Month 5-6: Resume, Networking, Applications**
- Hire professional military resume writer or use free resources (Hire Heroes USA, American Corporate Partners)
- Create civilian resume translating your 25B experience (use examples from this guide)
- Build LinkedIn profile optimized for IT roles (include "Army 25B," "Security+ certified," "Secret clearance," etc.)
- Apply to 20-30 positions across multiple companies and roles (don't put all eggs in one basket)
- Register on job boards: ClearanceJobs.com, Dice.com, Indeed, USAJobs.gov, LinkedIn Jobs
- Attend veteran hiring events, career fairs, and networking events
- Reach out to 25B veterans who transitioned before you (ask for advice, referrals, insights)
- Consider SkillBridge programs with defense contractors, tech companies, or federal agencies

### 3-6 Months Before Separation:

**Month 7-8: Interview Prep and Continued Applications**
- Practice interview responses using STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Prepare to explain your technical experience in civilian terms
- Research companies you're interviewing with (know their tech stack, culture, mission)
- Have 2-3 "war stories" ready that demonstrate problem-solving, leadership, and technical competence
- Continue applying (plan on 50-100 applications total—don't get discouraged by rejections)
- Follow up on previous applications
- Expand network (attend meetups, join online communities, engage on LinkedIn)

**Month 9-10: Offers and Negotiations**
- Research salary ranges for your role, location, and experience level (use Glassdoor, PayScale, salary.com)
- Understand your clearance value (adds $20K-$40K for contractor roles)
- Don't accept the first offer—negotiate (most companies expect it)
- Compare total compensation (salary + benefits + PTO + retirement + bonuses)
- Consider long-term career growth, not just starting salary
- Get everything in writing before accepting

### Final 3 Months (Transition Period):

**Month 11-12: Preparation and Onboarding**
- Complete TAP/SFL-TAP transition program
- Finalize DD-214 and ensure accuracy (mistakes are hard to fix later)
- Transfer GI Bill benefits if applicable
- Set up VA healthcare enrollment
- Coordinate final out-processing with job start date
- Maintain clearance status (if going contractor route, don't let it lapse)
- Move if necessary (arrange housing, logistics for new city)
- Begin new job—expect 30-90 day onboarding/learning curve

## Job Search Strategy Specific to 25Bs

### Where to Focus Your Search:

**1. Defense Contractors (If You Have Clearance):**
- ClearanceJobs.com is THE job board for cleared positions
- Apply directly on contractor websites (Northrop, Lockheed, Booz Allen, Leidos, etc.)
- Attend defense contractor hiring events (they actively recruit veterans)
- Network with veterans already working at these companies (referrals matter)

**2. Tech Companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc.):**
- Use company military hiring programs (Microsoft MSSA, AWS programs, etc.)
- Apply through veteran-specific portals when available
- Emphasize your technical skills and certifications (they care less about clearance)
- Be prepared to demonstrate hands-on skills (labs, technical interviews)

**3. Federal Civilian Positions:**
- USAJobs.gov is the only portal for federal jobs
- Learn how to write federal resumes (different format than private sector)
- Understand veteran preference (5 or 10 points added to your score)
- Be patient—federal hiring takes 6-12 months minimum
- Target positions at GS-9 or GS-11 level (don't undersell yourself)

**4. Local Companies and State Government:**
- Don't overlook local opportunities (every company needs IT staff)
- State and local governments offer stability, benefits, and veteran preference
- Large corporations (banks, hospitals, universities, utilities) need IT professionals
- Often less competitive than defense contractors or big tech

### Networking Tips for 25Bs:

- Join veteran IT groups on LinkedIn and Facebook
- Attend local veteran networking events and hiring fairs
- Connect with other Signal Corps veterans (they'll help you)
- Reach out to hiring managers directly on LinkedIn (respectfully)
- Use your military network (ask sergeants, officers, fellow soldiers for connections)
- Join professional organizations (local IT groups, cybersecurity meetups, cloud user groups)

### Red Flags to Avoid:

- Jobs requiring extensive unpaid "training" or requiring you to buy equipment
- "Contract-to-hire" roles that keep you contracting forever (some are legitimate, many aren't)
- Companies that won't tell you the salary range upfront (walk away)
- Positions that require certs you don't have but won't pay for training (negotiate)
- Help desk roles paying under $45K (you're worth more as a 25B)

## Interview Preparation: 15 Questions You'll Face

Here are common interview questions for IT roles with strong answer frameworks:

**1. "Tell me about your experience with network administration."**
**Strong answer:** "As an Army 25B, I managed enterprise network infrastructure supporting 500+ users across multiple sites. I configured and maintained Cisco routers and switches, implemented VLANs for network segmentation, troubleshot connectivity issues, and monitored network performance using tools like SolarWinds. In my last assignment, I maintained 99.8% uptime for mission-critical communications systems. I hold my CCNA certification and have hands-on experience with routing protocols, ACLs, and network security implementation."

**2. "Describe a time you had to troubleshoot a critical system failure under pressure."**
**STAR format:**
- Situation: "During a training exercise, our primary communications server crashed, cutting off connectivity for 300+ users."
- Task: "As the senior 25B on duty, I needed to diagnose and restore service immediately—commanders needed real-time communications for the exercise."
- Action: "I systematically checked hardware, reviewed logs, identified a failed RAID controller, swapped in a spare from inventory, rebuilt the array, and restored from backup. Simultaneously, I set up a temporary workaround using secondary systems."
- Result: "Restored full service within 90 minutes. Documented the incident, updated our disaster recovery procedures, and implemented monitoring alerts to prevent recurrence."

**3. "What certifications do you hold, and why did you pursue them?"**
**Strong answer:** "I hold CompTIA Security+ and Cisco CCNA certifications. I pursued Security+ because it's an industry baseline for cybersecurity knowledge and required for DoD contractor positions—it demonstrates I understand security principles, risk management, and compliance. I got my CCNA because network engineering is my career focus, and CCNA is the recognized industry standard for network professionals. Cisco equipment is everywhere in enterprise IT, and having hands-on experience backed by certification makes me immediately valuable to employers. I'm currently studying for my AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert because cloud skills are increasingly critical."

**4. "How do you stay current with technology changes?"**
**Strong answer:** "I'm committed to continuous learning. I follow IT industry news through sites like Ars Technica, The Register, and vendor blogs (Cisco, AWS, Microsoft). I maintain a home lab where I experiment with new technologies—currently learning Kubernetes and Terraform. I participate in online communities like Reddit's r/sysadmin and r/networking. I'm working toward additional certifications (AWS, Azure), which forces me to learn new platforms. In the Army, I had to adapt to new systems constantly, so continuous learning is already part of my work ethic."

**5. "Why are you transitioning from the military to civilian IT?"**
**Strong answer:** "I've loved my time as a 25B and the technical challenges the Army provided. I'm transitioning because I want to focus exclusively on IT career development rather than balancing IT work with military duties. I'm looking for opportunities to specialize deeper in areas like cloud engineering and network architecture. I value what I learned in the military—discipline, problem-solving under pressure, accountability—and I'm excited to bring those skills to a civilian IT team while continuing to grow my technical expertise."

**6. "What experience do you have with Windows Server or Active Directory?"**
**Strong answer:** "I administered Active Directory environments supporting 800+ user accounts. I created and managed group policies to enforce security settings, managed permissions and access controls, automated account provisioning using PowerShell scripts, and troubleshot authentication issues. I also maintained Windows Server 2016 and 2019 systems, applied patches, configured domain controllers, and implemented backup solutions. I understand organizational units, group policy objects, trust relationships, and FSMO roles. I've worked extensively with PowerShell for automation and reporting."

**7. "Describe your experience with cybersecurity and compliance."**
**Strong answer:** "As a 25B in the Army, cybersecurity was part of every task. I implemented DISA STIG security controls on Windows and Linux systems, conducted vulnerability scans using ACAS/Nessus, remediated critical findings within required timeframes, and maintained compliance documentation. I ensured systems met DoD security requirements before connecting them to operational networks. I understand defense-in-depth, principle of least privilege, and risk management frameworks. I hold my Security+ certification and understand NIST frameworks, compliance requirements, and security best practices."

**8. "What's your experience with virtualization and cloud technologies?"**
**Strong answer:** "I've worked with VMware ESXi managing virtual machines in production environments—deploying VMs, managing resources, creating snapshots, and troubleshooting performance issues. I understand hypervisors, resource allocation, and virtual networking. I'm currently building cloud skills—I've completed AWS training through AWS Educate (available for veterans) and I'm studying for my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. I understand IaaS, PaaS, SaaS models and core cloud concepts like elasticity, scalability, and high availability. I've worked hands-on with EC2, S3, VPCs, and IAM in my home lab environment."

**9. "How do you prioritize when you have multiple urgent issues?"**
**Strong answer:** "In the military, I constantly dealt with competing priorities. My approach: assess impact and urgency. If a server outage affects 500 users versus one person's laptop issue, the server takes priority. I communicate clearly with affected users about expected resolution times. I'm not afraid to escalate or ask for help when needed—nobody expects one person to fix everything simultaneously. I document issues in ticketing systems so nothing gets lost. During my time as a 25B, I regularly managed 10-15 open issues while maintaining operational systems. It's about triage, communication, and systematic problem-solving."

**10. "What's your leadership experience?"**
**Strong answer:** "As an E-5 in the Army, I supervised 3-4 junior 25Bs, trained new soldiers on IT systems and procedures, led shifts in our network operations center, and mentored soldiers for promotion. I created training materials, conducted hands-on labs, and ensured my team met technical standards. I believe in leading by example—if I'm asking someone to stay late to fix an issue, I'm staying with them. I focused on developing my soldiers' technical skills and confidence. Good leadership in IT means removing obstacles, providing clear direction, and ensuring your team has the knowledge and tools to succeed."

**11. "Tell me about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it."**
**Strong answer:** "Early in my time as a 25B, I was applying security patches and accidentally rebooted a production server during business hours without proper notification. It caused a 15-minute outage affecting 100+ users. I immediately owned the mistake, notified my supervisor and affected users, documented the incident, and worked with leadership to implement a change control process requiring maintenance windows and notifications for all production system changes. I learned that communication and following procedures are just as important as technical skills. Since then, I've never had a similar incident—that lesson stuck."

**12. "What tools and technologies are you most comfortable with?"**
**Strong answer:** "I'm most comfortable with Cisco networking equipment (routers, switches, IOS), Windows Server (2016/2019, Active Directory, PowerShell), basic Linux administration (Red Hat, Ubuntu), network monitoring tools (SolarWinds, Wireshark), and security tools (Nessus, ACAS). I've worked with VoIP systems (Cisco CUCM), virtualization (VMware ESXi), and ticketing systems (Remedy, ServiceNow). I have hands-on experience with cabling and infrastructure installation. I'm currently expanding into cloud platforms (AWS) and automation (Python, Terraform). I'm comfortable learning new technologies quickly—the Army constantly introduced new systems, so adaptability is one of my strengths."

**13. "Why should we hire you over other candidates?"**
**Strong answer:** "I bring proven IT experience in high-pressure environments where failure wasn't an option. I've managed enterprise networks supporting hundreds of users, maintained mission-critical systems, and troubleshot complex issues with limited resources. I hold my Security+ and CCNA certifications, and I have an active Secret clearance. Beyond technical skills, I bring discipline, accountability, and a strong work ethic. I don't quit when things get difficult—I solve problems. I'm also coachable and eager to learn. I'm not looking for just any job; I'm looking for a career where I can contribute immediately while continuing to grow my expertise. I'm confident I can add value to your team from day one."

**14. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**
**Strong answer:** "In five years, I see myself as a senior network engineer or cloud architect, having deepened my technical expertise and earned additional certifications like CCNP or AWS Professional-level certs. I want to be the person my team relies on for complex problems and mentoring junior engineers. I'm interested in eventually moving into technical leadership—managing infrastructure projects, making architectural decisions, and helping develop IT strategy. I'm committed to continuous learning because technology changes rapidly. I want to work for a company that values professional development and invests in their employees' growth."

**15. "Do you have any questions for us?"**
**Ask these:**
- "What does a typical day look like for this role?"
- "What are the biggest technical challenges your IT team is currently facing?"
- "What opportunities for training and professional development does the company offer?"
- "What does success look like in this role after 6 months? After 1 year?"
- "What's the team structure? Who would I be working with?"
- "What technologies and tools does your team currently use?"
- "Is there opportunity for advancement? What does the career path look like?"
- "Why do you enjoy working here?" (Ask the interviewer personally)

**Interview Tips:**
- Dress business casual (button-down shirt, slacks) unless told otherwise
- Bring copies of your resume, certifications, and DD-214 (some contractors want to verify service)
- Be 10-15 minutes early
- Have a notepad to take notes (shows you're engaged)
- Send a thank-you email within 24 hours
- Be confident but humble—you have valuable experience, but acknowledge you're still learning

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Here are the biggest mistakes 25Bs make during transition:

### 1. Underselling Your Experience
**The mistake:** Thinking you're "just entry-level" because you're leaving the military.
**The reality:** You have 2-6 years of hands-on IT experience that many civilians don't have. You've managed real networks, troubleshot real problems, and worked under real pressure. Don't apply for entry-level help desk roles paying $40K when you're qualified for $80K+ network administrator positions.
**The fix:** Target roles that match your actual experience level. If you maintained enterprise networks, apply for network administrator or junior network engineer roles. If you managed servers, apply for systems administrator positions. Your military rank doesn't determine your civilian job level—your skills and experience do.

### 2. Relying Only on Job Boards
**The mistake:** Only applying to jobs on Indeed or LinkedIn and waiting for responses.
**The reality:** 80% of jobs are filled through networking, referrals, and direct outreach. Thousands of 25Bs are applying to the same job postings. You're competing with civilians who have polished resumes and civilian references.
**The fix:** Network aggressively. Connect with veterans in your target companies. Ask for informational interviews. Attend veteran hiring events. Join LinkedIn groups. Message hiring managers directly (respectfully). Use your military network—ask everyone you know if they know anyone in IT. Referrals get interviews.

### 3. Not Getting Certified Before Separation
**The mistake:** Planning to "get certifications later" after you find a job.
**The reality:** You have time, resources, and funding (Army COOL, GI Bill) while you're still in. Once you're out, you'll be job hunting, interviewing, possibly relocating, and dealing with life changes. You won't have the same focus for studying.
**The fix:** Get Security+ and CCNA before you separate. These two certs will dramatically improve your job prospects and salary offers. Army COOL covers the costs. Use your off-duty time. Your future self will thank you.

### 4. Accepting the First Offer Without Negotiating
**The mistake:** Being so grateful for a job offer that you immediately accept without negotiating.
**The reality:** Most companies expect negotiation and build flexibility into initial offers. You'll lose $5K-$15K in first-year salary (which compounds over your career) by not negotiating. Employers won't rescind offers because you asked for more money (if they do, you don't want to work there anyway).
**The fix:** Research market rates for the role and location. When you get an offer, thank them, ask for 24-48 hours to review, and come back with a counter-offer 10-20% higher. Worst case, they say no and you accept the original offer. Best case, you get more money, better benefits, or both.

### 5. Letting Your Clearance Lapse
**The mistake:** Not maintaining your clearance after separation because you're not going into contracting immediately.
**The reality:** An active clearance is worth $20K-$40K in additional salary. It takes 12-18 months to reinvestigate if it lapses. Many high-paying jobs require active clearances—you won't even be considered if yours is expired.
**The fix:** If you have a clearance, find a job that requires it within 2 years of separation. Even if your dream job is at Google (doesn't require clearance), consider defense contractors for your first 2-3 years to keep your clearance active. You can always transition to non-cleared work later, but you can't easily get your clearance back.

### 6. Writing Resumes Full of Military Acronyms
**The mistake:** Listing duties like "Maintained COMSEC, performed PMCS, managed STT systems" without explaining what that means.
**The reality:** Civilian hiring managers don't speak military. They'll skip your resume because they can't understand it. You're filtering yourself out before you get a chance.
**The fix:** Translate everything into civilian terms. Instead of "Managed COMSEC," write "Administered encryption and secure communications systems per federal security standards." Instead of "Performed PMCS," write "Conducted preventive maintenance and diagnostic troubleshooting on communications equipment." Use this guide's resume examples as templates.

### 7. Targeting Only Big Tech or Defense Contractors
**The mistake:** Only applying to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or major defense contractors like Lockheed.
**The reality:** These companies get thousands of applications. Competition is intense. Hiring processes are lengthy. Meanwhile, hundreds of mid-sized companies, local businesses, and smaller contractors desperately need IT professionals and offer excellent salaries and career growth.
**The fix:** Cast a wide net. Apply to companies you've never heard of. Regional defense contractors, local IT service providers, mid-sized corporations, healthcare organizations, universities, and state governments all need IT staff. You'll get interviews faster, face less competition, and often get better mentorship and career development in smaller organizations.

## Success Stories: Real 25B Transitions

**Jason, 28, E-5 → Network Engineer at Defense Contractor**
Jason served 6 years as a 25B, got out as a sergeant with Secret clearance and CCNA certification (earned while on active duty using Army COOL). Applied to defense contractors through ClearanceJobs.com. Within 2 months, received three offers. Accepted network engineer position with Northrop Grumman in Northern Virginia at $95K. After 2 years, promoted to senior network engineer at $118K. "Getting my CCNA before I got out made all the difference. I walked into interviews confident I could do the job, and my clearance meant they didn't have to wait a year to get me one. Best decision I made was taking certifications seriously while I was still in."

**Maria, 26, E-4 → Cloud Engineer at AWS**
Maria served 4 years as a 25B, used her last 6 months to get Security+ and AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (used free AWS Educate for veterans and got exam fees reimbursed through VA). Applied to Amazon's veteran hiring program and multiple AWS partner companies. Landed cloud engineer role at AWS partner consulting firm in Austin, TX at $88K. "I didn't think I was qualified for cloud roles, but I learned AWS while I was still in, built some personal projects to show I understood the platform, and emphasized my military troubleshooting and learning ability. Two years later, I'm making $115K and working on solutions architecture. The cloud field has so much opportunity for veterans."

**David, 32, E-6 → Systems Administrator, then DevOps Engineer**
David served 10 years as a 25B, got out as a staff sergeant. Started as systems administrator at a hospital system in Denver at $75K. "I wanted stability and good benefits, and healthcare IT offered both. I spent 3 years learning automation, got my AWS cert and learned Python scripting, then transitioned to DevOps engineer role at a SaaS company at $125K. The military taught me systems thinking and troubleshooting—DevOps is just applying those skills to cloud infrastructure and automation. I'm making more than I ever imagined, and I love the work."

**Chris, 24, E-4 → Federal IT Specialist (GS-11)**
Chris served 4 years as a 25B, applied for federal civilian positions through USAJobs.gov during his last year. "The process was slow—it took 10 months from application to job offer—but veteran preference helped a lot. I got hired as IT Specialist (Network Administration) at GS-11 in Washington DC, which with locality pay is $92K. I have a pension, great healthcare, job security, and excellent work-life balance. The pay isn't Silicon Valley money, but I'm building a long-term career. In 2-3 years I'll promote to GS-12, then GS-13. It's steady, predictable, and honestly, I love the stability after 4 years of Army chaos."

## Education Options: Do You Need a Degree?

**The short answer:** No, you don't need a bachelor's degree for most IT roles. Certifications and experience matter more. However, a degree helps for advancement to management and some companies have degree requirements.

**The long answer:**

### When a Degree Doesn't Matter:
- Network administrator, systems administrator, and most technical roles prioritize certifications and hands-on experience
- Defense contractors care about clearance and technical certs more than degrees
- Tech companies (Google, AWS, Microsoft) increasingly hire based on skills, not degrees
- If you have Security+, CCNA, and 4-6 years of 25B experience, you're competitive without a degree

### When a Degree Helps:
- Management and leadership roles (IT Manager, Director of IT, CIO) often require bachelor's degrees
- Some federal positions have degree requirements or offer higher starting GS levels with degrees
- Large corporations may filter applications by degree requirements (though this is changing)
- Long-term career advancement—many companies cap promotions without a degree

### Best Degree Options for 25Bs (If You Decide to Pursue One):

**1. Bachelor's in Information Technology or Computer Science**
- **Cost:** $0 using GI Bill (covers up to $26K+/year, enough for most state universities)
- **Time:** 2-4 years (you'll have some credits from military training, shortens timeline)
- **ROI:** Opens management paths, satisfies degree requirements, provides structured learning
- **Recommendation:** Online programs work well for working IT professionals (WGU, UMUC, Arizona State, Penn State World Campus all have solid IT programs and work with veterans)

**2. Associate Degree in Network Administration or Cybersecurity**
- **Cost:** $0 using GI Bill
- **Time:** 1-2 years
- **ROI:** Faster than bachelor's, combines with certifications for strong credentials
- **Recommendation:** Good compromise if you want some formal education but don't want to commit to 4 years

### Alternative Education:

**Boot Camps (Coding, Cybersecurity, Cloud):**
- 8-16 weeks intensive training
- Some are GI Bill eligible
- Range from excellent (provide real skills + job placement) to scams (watch out)
- Research thoroughly before paying (look at job placement rates, reviews, outcomes)

**Online Training Platforms:**
- Udemy, Coursera, Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, etc.
- Inexpensive ($10-$50/month)
- Great for learning specific skills (Python, AWS, networking concepts)
- Don't replace certifications, but excellent supplements

### Bottom Line on Education:
Get employed first with your existing skills and certifications. Use your GI Bill while working (online degree programs are flexible). Don't delay your career waiting to finish a degree you don't need yet. Experience + certifications > degree with no experience. You can always get a degree later—you can't get your early career years back.

**Remote Work Consideration:**
Many IT roles are now fully remote or hybrid.

Maximize this opportunity.
