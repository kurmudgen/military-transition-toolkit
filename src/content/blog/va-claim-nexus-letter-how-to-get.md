# VA Nexus Letters: How to Get One and Why You Need It

## Bottom Line Up Front

A **nexus letter** is a medical opinion stating your condition is connected to your military service. It bridges the gap between your diagnosis and service connection. Without a nexus, you have a condition but no proof it's service-related—and **no service connection means no compensation**. A strong nexus letter from a qualified doctor can turn a denial into an approval. Cost: $500-2,500 depending on complexity. Investment: potentially worth tens of thousands in lifetime benefits.

## What Is a Nexus Letter?

A nexus letter is a written medical opinion that states your current medical condition is "at least as likely as not" (50% or greater probability) related to your military service.

**What it does:**
- Establishes the medical link between your condition and service
- Provides expert opinion the VA must consider
- Addresses service connection that records alone may not prove

**The magic words:** "It is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that the veteran's [condition] was caused by / is related to / was aggravated by [military service/service-connected condition]."

**Why "at least as likely as not"?**

The VA uses a "benefit of the doubt" standard. If there's a 50/50 chance your condition is service-related, you win. The nexus letter needs to establish at least 50% probability—not certainty.

## When Do You Need a Nexus Letter?

### You Likely Need a Nexus Letter If:

**1. Your condition was diagnosed after service**

If you weren't diagnosed during service, the VA questions whether it's related. A nexus letter explains why the condition started in service even if not documented.

**2. There's a gap in your records**

If service treatment records don't document your condition, you need a medical expert to explain the connection.

**3. You're claiming secondary conditions**

Claiming sleep apnea secondary to PTSD? You need a nexus opinion explaining how PTSD caused sleep apnea.

**4. The C&P examiner gave a negative opinion**

If the VA's examiner said your condition isn't service-connected, a private nexus letter can counter that opinion.

**5. Your claim was denied for lack of nexus**

Denial letters often state "no nexus to service." A nexus letter can reopen and win your claim.

### You May Not Need a Nexus Letter If:

**1. Presumptive conditions**

Some conditions are presumed service-connected (Agent Orange conditions, Gulf War illnesses, certain exposures). No nexus required.

**2. In-service diagnosis**

If you were diagnosed during service and the condition continues, nexus is often established by records.

**3. Clear service treatment records**

If your records clearly show the in-service event, diagnosis, and continuity, a nexus may not be necessary.

## What Makes a Strong Nexus Letter

### Required Elements

**1. Doctor's credentials**

- Full name and credentials (MD, DO, PhD)
- License number and state
- Specialty relevant to the condition
- CV or brief background

**2. Review of evidence**

The doctor must state they reviewed:
- Your medical records
- Service treatment records
- Any other relevant evidence

**3. Current diagnosis**

Confirmation of your current diagnosis with diagnostic code if applicable.

**4. Nexus statement**

The key sentence: "It is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that [veteran's condition] is caused by/related to/aggravated by [military service/specific in-service event/service-connected condition]."

**5. Rationale**

This is what separates strong letters from weak ones. The doctor must explain WHY they reached this conclusion:
- Medical reasoning
- Reference to your specific history
- Citation of medical literature
- Explanation of the mechanism of connection

**6. Signature and date**

The letter must be signed and dated by the physician.

### What Makes a Nexus Letter WEAK

- **No rationale:** Conclusion without explanation
- **Wrong specialty:** Orthopedic opinion from a dermatologist
- **Boilerplate language:** Generic letter not specific to your case
- **No credentials:** Missing license or qualifications
- **Wrong probability language:** "Possibly" or "may be" instead of "at least as likely as not"
- **No evidence review:** Doctor didn't review your records

## How to Get a Nexus Letter

### Option 1: VA Doctor

**Pros:** Free, already familiar with your case
**Cons:** Many VA doctors won't write nexus letters; may be reluctant to opine on service connection

**How to ask:**
"I'm filing a VA disability claim for [condition]. Would you be willing to write a medical opinion letter stating that my [condition] is at least as likely as not related to my military service?"

Some VA doctors will; many won't. Don't push if they decline.

### Option 2: Private Treating Physician

**Pros:** Already knows your case, may have lower cost
**Cons:** May not understand VA requirements, may not be comfortable opining on service connection

**How to ask:**
Provide them with:
- Explanation of what a nexus letter is
- Your service history and in-service event
- Medical records
- Template or sample nexus letter

**Cost:** Often $200-500 if they agree

### Option 3: Independent Medical Opinion Service

**Pros:** Specialists in VA claims, know exactly what's needed, high-quality opinions
**Cons:** Most expensive option

**Services include:**
- Review of your complete medical history
- Opinion from appropriate specialist
- Properly formatted nexus letter
- Citation of medical literature

**Cost:** $500-2,500 depending on complexity

**Popular providers:**
- Nexus Letters (various)
- IMO providers (search "VA independent medical opinion")
- VSO-recommended providers

### Option 4: IMO Through Attorney/Representative

If you're working with a VA attorney or accredited representative, they may have medical experts they work with.

- Citation of research on MST and PTSD

### Sleep Apnea Secondary to PTSD

**Key elements:**

## What If You Can't Afford a Nexus Letter?

**Options:**

1. **Ask your VA doctor** - It's free if they agree

2. **Ask your private doctor** - May be cheaper than IMO services

3. **File without one** - The C&P examiner may provide a positive nexus opinion (though risky)

4. **Use lay evidence** - Personal and buddy statements explaining the connection can sometimes be sufficient

5. **Appeal with nexus later** - If denied, save up for a nexus letter and file a supplemental claim

6. **VSO assistance** - Some VSOs have relationships with medical providers who offer reduced rates

## Using Nexus Letters in Appeals

If your claim was denied for lack of nexus, a private nexus letter is often the key to winning on appeal.

**Strategy:**

1. Review denial letter for specific nexus issues
2. Get private nexus letter addressing those issues
3. File supplemental claim with the nexus letter as new evidence
4. The VA must reconsider with the new evidence

**Important:** Your private nexus letter should directly address why the C&P examiner was wrong or why your evidence supports connection.

## Common Questions

### Will the VA accept a private nexus letter?

Yes. The VA must consider all evidence, including private medical opinions. However, they're not bound to accept it—they'll weigh it against other evidence.

### Can a nurse practitioner write a nexus letter?

Yes, but opinions from physicians (MD/DO) in relevant specialties generally carry more weight.

### How long should a nexus letter be?

Length doesn't matter—substance does. A two-page letter with strong rationale beats a five-page letter with weak reasoning.

### What if the VA disagrees with my nexus letter?

If the VA's opinion differs, you can appeal. In appeals, having both a private nexus letter and strong rationale gives you a better chance.

### Should I get a nexus letter before filing?

Ideally, yes. It's better to submit a complete claim with a nexus letter than to file, get denied, and then submit one on appeal.

## The Bottom Line

A nexus letter can be the difference between approval and denial. If your records don't clearly establish service connection, invest in a quality nexus letter.

**The math:** A $1,500 nexus letter that results in a 50% rating ($1,075/month) pays for itself in less than two months—and you receive that compensation for life.

Don't let the cost stop you. A good nexus letter is one of the best investments you can make in your VA claim.
