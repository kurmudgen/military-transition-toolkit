# C&P Exam for Knee Conditions: Complete Preparation Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Your C&P exam for knee conditions determines your VA disability rating. The examiner will measure **range of motion (ROM)**, test **stability**, and assess **functional impairment**. Knee ratings range from **0% to 60%** depending on limitation of motion, instability, and other factors—and you can receive separate ratings for different knee problems (ROM limitation + instability = higher combined rating). The key to a successful exam: **don't minimize symptoms, describe your worst days, and document how knee pain affects daily life**.

## How the VA Rates Knee Conditions

Knee conditions are rated under multiple diagnostic codes, and you can receive **separate ratings** for different knee problems:

### Diagnostic Code 5260 - Limitation of Flexion

| Rating | Flexion Limited To |
|--------|-------------------|
| 0% | 60 degrees |
| 10% | 45 degrees |
| 20% | 30 degrees |
| 30% | 15 degrees |

Normal knee flexion: 140 degrees

### Diagnostic Code 5261 - Limitation of Extension

| Rating | Extension Limited To |
|--------|---------------------|
| 0% | 5 degrees |
| 10% | 10 degrees |
| 20% | 15 degrees |
| 30% | 20 degrees |
| 40% | 30 degrees |
| 50% | 45 degrees |

Normal extension: 0 degrees (fully straight)

### Diagnostic Code 5257 - Instability

| Rating | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Slight recurrent subluxation or lateral instability |
| 20% | Moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability |
| 30% | Severe recurrent subluxation or lateral instability |

**Key Point:** You can receive separate ratings for limitation of motion AND instability. If your knee has both problems, you should receive two ratings.

### Diagnostic Code 5258 - Dislocated Semilunar Cartilage (Meniscus)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 20% | Frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion |

### Diagnostic Code 5259 - Removal of Semilunar Cartilage (Meniscectomy)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Symptomatic removal of meniscus |

### Diagnostic Code 5256 - Ankylosis (Frozen Knee)

| Rating | Position |
|--------|----------|
| 30% | Favorable angle in full extension, or in slight flexion between 0-10 degrees |
| 40% | In flexion between 10-20 degrees |
| 50% | In flexion between 20-45 degrees |
| 60% | Extremely unfavorable, in flexion at 45 degrees or more |

### Diagnostic Code 5055 - Knee Replacement

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 100% | For one year following implantation |
| 30% | Minimum rating thereafter |
| 60% | With chronic residuals consisting of severe painful motion or weakness |

## What Happens During the C&P Exam

The knee C&P exam typically lasts 20-45 minutes. Here's what to expect:

### 1. Medical History Review

The examiner will ask about:
- When your knee problems started
- In-service incidents that caused or aggravated your knee
- Current symptoms and their frequency
- Treatment history (surgeries, physical therapy, injections)
- Medications for knee pain
- Impact on daily activities and work

### 2. Range of Motion Testing

The examiner will measure:

**Active ROM:** How far you can move your knee on your own
**Passive ROM:** How far the examiner can move your knee for you

They'll measure:
- **Flexion:** How far you can bend your knee (normal = 140 degrees)
- **Extension:** How straight your leg can get (normal = 0 degrees)

**Critical: DeLuca Factors**

Under DeLuca v. Brown, the examiner MUST consider additional functional loss due to:
- Pain on movement
- Weakness
- Fatigability
- Incoordination
- **Flare-ups** (very important)

### 3. Repetitive Use Testing

The examiner will have you flex and extend your knee **three times** and measure again to assess:
- Pain with repetition
- Additional limitation after repetitive use
- Fatigability

### 4. Flare-Up Assessment

**This is critical.** The examiner should ask about flare-ups:
- How often do they occur?
- How long do they last?
- What triggers them?
- **How much additional limitation do you have during flare-ups?**

If you experience flare-ups where your knee is significantly worse, you must describe them in detail. The examiner should estimate additional functional loss during flare-ups.

### 5. Stability Testing

The examiner will perform:

**Anterior/Posterior Drawer Test:** Assesses ACL/PCL stability
**Lachman Test:** Another ACL assessment
**Varus/Valgus Stress Test:** Assesses MCL/LCL stability
**McMurray Test:** Assesses meniscus

If your knee feels unstable, "gives way," or you've had it "buckle," tell the examiner.

### 6. Physical Examination

The examiner will also check:
- Swelling (effusion)
- Tenderness
- Crepitus (grinding sensation)
- Muscle atrophy
- Scars from surgery
- Gait abnormalities

## Questions You'll Be Asked

Prepare answers for these common questions:

**About Your Service:**
- "When did your knee problems start?"
- "What happened to your knee during service?"
- "Did you have any specific injuries?"
- "What was your MOS/job, and how did it affect your knees?"

**About Current Symptoms:**
- "Where exactly is your knee pain?"
- "How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1-10?"
- "Is the pain constant or does it come and go?"
- "What makes it worse? What makes it better?"
- "Do you have stiffness? When is it worst?"
- "Does your knee swell?"
- "Does your knee lock up?"
- "Does your knee give way or feel unstable?"
- "Do you hear or feel grinding/popping?"

**About Flare-Ups:**
- "Do you have flare-ups where your knee is significantly worse?"
- "How often do flare-ups occur?"
- "How long do they last?"
- "What triggers them?"
- "How limited are you during a flare-up?"

**About Function:**
- "How far can you walk before your knee hurts?"
- "Can you climb stairs?"
- "Can you squat or kneel?"
- "Do you use a brace or assistive device?"
- "How does your knee affect your work?"
- "What activities can't you do because of your knee?"

## What to Tell the Examiner

### Be Specific About Pain and Limitations

**Instead of:** "My knee hurts."
**Say:** "I have constant aching pain in the front of my knee, rated 5-6 out of 10 daily. It increases to 8-9 during flare-ups. I can't walk more than half a mile without significant pain. Climbing stairs causes sharp pain. I can't kneel or squat."

### Describe Your Worst Days

The VA doesn't rate you on your best days. Describe what your knee is like on bad days:

"On bad days, I can barely bend my knee past 90 degrees. The pain is severe, and I have to use my cane. I've missed work because of knee flare-ups at least twice a month."

### Document Functional Impact

Connect your knee problems to real-life limitations:

- "I can't play with my kids on the floor because I can't kneel."
- "I had to switch to a desk job because I couldn't stand for long periods."
- "I can't do yard work or home repairs that require squatting."
- "Going up and down stairs at home causes significant pain."
- "I have to sit on the aisle in theaters because I need to stretch my leg."

### Discuss Assistive Devices

If you use any of these, mention them:
- Knee brace (and how often)
- Cane or walking stick
- Compression sleeves
- Ice packs regularly
- TENS unit

### Explain Instability

If your knee gives way or feels unstable:

"My knee gives out on me about twice a week, especially on uneven surfaces or stairs. I've fallen three times in the past year because my knee buckled. I don't trust my knee and have to be careful with every step."

## What to Bring to Your Exam

### Essential Documents
- VA appointment letter
- Photo ID
- List of current medications

### Supporting Evidence
- Service treatment records showing knee problems
- Any private medical records for your knee
- MRI or X-ray reports
- Physical therapy records
- Surgical records if you had knee surgery
- List of all knee treatments and dates

### Helpful Items
- Your knee brace (wear it if you normally use it)
- Cane or walking stick (if you use one)
- Written list of symptoms and limitations
- Log of flare-ups (dates, duration, triggers)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Being "Tough"

Many veterans minimize symptoms during the exam. Don't.

**Wrong:** "It's not that bad. I can push through it."
**Right:** "The pain significantly limits my activities. I can't do many things I used to."

### Mistake 2: Not Describing Flare-Ups

Flare-ups are critical. If you don't describe them, the examiner won't consider them.

**Wrong:** Not mentioning flare-ups.
**Right:** "I have flare-ups 2-3 times a week where my knee swells, pain increases to 8/10, and I can barely bend it past 60 degrees. They last 1-2 days."

### Mistake 3: Going on a "Good Day"

Don't reschedule your exam because you're having a good day. But DO describe your typical and worst days.

"Today is actually a better day for me. On my worse days, my knee is much more limited. I'd estimate I lose about 20 additional degrees of flexion during flare-ups."

### Mistake 4: Not Mentioning Instability

If your knee gives way or feels unstable, you need to tell the examiner explicitly. Instability is rated separately from limitation of motion.

**Wrong:** Only mentioning pain.
**Right:** "In addition to the pain and limited motion, my knee is unstable. It gives out on me regularly. I've fallen because of it."

### Mistake 5: Forgetting About Secondary Conditions

If your knee condition has caused other problems (hip pain, back pain, opposite knee pain from compensation), mention these as potential secondary conditions.

## Special Situations

### Bilateral Knee Conditions

If both knees are affected, each knee is rated separately. Make sure the examiner evaluates both knees completely.

### Post-Surgery Knees

If you've had knee surgery:
- Bring surgical records
- Describe residual symptoms
- Mention any hardware (screws, plates)
- Describe scarring (scars can be rated separately)

### Knee Replacement

If you've had a total knee replacement:
- You should receive 100% for one year post-surgery
- After one year, minimum rating is 30%
- If you have severe pain or weakness, you may qualify for 60%

### Meniscus Issues

If you've had meniscus surgery or have meniscus damage:
- DC 5258 (dislocated cartilage): 20% for locking, pain, effusion
- DC 5259 (removed cartilage): 10% if symptomatic

## After the Exam

### What the Examiner Reports

The examiner completes a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) that includes:
- Range of motion measurements
- Pain assessment
- Stability test results
- Functional impact
- Flare-up information
- Their medical opinion

### Timeline

- Examiner submits report: 2-4 weeks
- VA rating decision: 30-90 days after exam
- If denied or low-rated, you have one year to appeal

### If You Disagree

If your rating doesn't reflect your symptoms:
1. Review the exam report (request a copy)
2. Consider Higher-Level Review if there's a clear error
3. File a Supplemental Claim with new evidence (private medical opinion)
4. Get a private nexus letter if service connection was denied
