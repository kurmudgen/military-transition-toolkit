# VA Disability Rating for Hip Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Hip conditions are rated under **Diagnostic Codes 5250-5255** with ratings from **0% to 90%** depending on severity. Most veterans receive **10-30%** for limitation of motion or arthritis. Hip conditions are commonly claimed as **secondary** to back, knee, or ankle conditions due to altered gait. Each hip is rated separately. Hip replacement (arthroplasty) automatically rates at **minimum 30%**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Hip Conditions and How Does Military Service Cause Them?

**Common hip conditions:**
- Osteoarthritis
- Hip impingement (FAI)
- Labral tears
- Hip bursitis (trochanteric bursitis)
- Hip strain
- Avascular necrosis

**Military causes:**
- **Repetitive stress**: Running, rucking, jumping
- **Direct trauma**: Falls, vehicle accidents
- **Heavy loads**: Weight carried affects hips
- **Airborne/parachute operations**: Landing impacts
- **Altered gait**: From knee, back, or ankle injuries

**Secondary connections (common):**
- Back conditions causing altered gait → hip problems
- Knee conditions causing gait changes → hip problems
- Ankle/foot conditions → hip compensation

## VA Rating Criteria

### DC 5250 - Ankylosis of Hip

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **60%** | Favorable (flexion between 20°-40°, slight adduction/abduction) |
| **70%** | Intermediate |
| **90%** | Unfavorable (extremely unfavorable position) |

### DC 5251 - Limitation of Extension of Thigh

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Extension limited to 5° |

### DC 5252 - Limitation of Flexion of Thigh

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Flexion greater than 45° |
| **10%** | Flexion limited to 45° |
| **20%** | Flexion limited to 30° |
| **30%** | Flexion limited to 20° |
| **40%** | Flexion limited to 10° |

**Normal hip flexion: 0-125°**

### DC 5253 - Impairment of Thigh

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Limitation of adduction (can't cross legs) OR limitation of rotation (can't toe-out more than 15°) |
| **20%** | Limitation of abduction (motion lost beyond 10°) |

### DC 5254 - Flail Joint

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **80%** | Hip flail joint |

### DC 5255 - Impairment of Femur

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Malunion with slight hip disability |
| **20%** | Malunion with moderate hip disability |
| **30%** | Malunion with marked hip disability |
| **60%** | Fracture of femur neck with false joint |
| **80%** | Fracture of femur shaft/neck with nonunion and loose motion |

### Hip Replacement (Total Hip Arthroplasty)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **100%** | For 1 year following implantation (temporary) |
| **30%** | Minimum rating thereafter |
| **50%** | Moderately severe residuals (pain, weakness, limitation) |
| **70%** | Markedly severe residuals (chronic severe pain, limited motion) |
| **90%** | Painful motion or weakness requiring crutches |

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing hip complaints
- Documentation of physical demands
- Records of injuries
- Evidence supporting secondary connection to other conditions

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Orthopedic evaluation
- X-ray showing arthritis, degeneration
- MRI showing labral tears, impingement
- Physical examination findings

### Severity Evidence
- Range of motion measurements
- Functional limitations documented
- Use of assistive devices (cane, walker)
- Surgical records

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will measure:**
- Flexion (bending hip, bringing knee to chest)
- Extension (moving leg backward)
- Abduction (moving leg outward)
- Adduction (moving leg inward)
- Rotation (internal and external)

**What to tell them:**
- Where pain begins during movement
- Functional limitations (can't climb stairs, sit for long)
- Use of assistive devices
- Flare-up frequency and severity

## Secondary Conditions

**Hip conditions commonly secondary to:**
- Lumbar spine conditions (altered gait)
- Knee conditions (compensation)
- Ankle/foot conditions (gait changes)

**Hip conditions can cause:**
- Back pain (compensation)
- Knee problems (opposite leg stress)
- Depression (chronic pain)

## Personal Statement Template

**Current Symptoms:**
- Pain: [location, severity, frequency]
- Limitation: [describe what movements are difficult]
- Stiffness: [when, duration]
- Clicking/grinding: [if present]

**Functional Impact:**
- Walking: [limitation]
- Stairs: [difficulty]

- Sleep: [position difficulties]

**Treatment:**
- [List medications, therapy, injections, surgery]

I certify these statements are true.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim hip problems secondary to my back condition?
Yes. This is very common. Altered gait from back problems causes compensatory stress on hips.

### What if I had hip replacement?
You receive 100% for one year post-surgery, then minimum 30% thereafter based on residuals.

### Can I get separate ratings for both hips?
Yes. Each hip is rated independently.
