# Vision Problems Secondary to TBI: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Common TBI residual
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-100% (depends on type and severity)
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected TBI, vision evaluation, neuro-ophthalmology assessment, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** High (70%+) with documented visual dysfunction

Vision problems are extremely common after traumatic brain injury, affecting 50-75% of TBI patients. If you have service-connected TBI and experience visual difficulties, this is a strong secondary claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For vision problems secondary to TBI:
- Your TBI must be service-connected
- Visual dysfunction must be documented
- Medical evidence links vision problems to TBI

## How TBI Causes Vision Problems

### Brain Structures Involved

**Visual Processing Areas:**
- Primary visual cortex (occipital lobe)
- Visual association areas
- Optic radiations
- Cranial nerves III, IV, VI (eye movement)
- Brainstem pathways

### Types of TBI-Related Vision Problems

**Oculomotor Dysfunction:**
- Eye tracking problems
- Convergence insufficiency
- Accommodation dysfunction
- Eye teaming problems

**Visual Processing Disorders:**
- Visual field loss
- Visual perception problems
- Light sensitivity (photophobia)
- Visual information processing delays

**Binocular Vision Problems:**
- Double vision (diplopia)
- Eye alignment issues
- Depth perception problems

**Other Visual Issues:**
- Blurred vision
- Difficulty reading
- Visual fatigue

### Statistics

- 50-75% of TBI patients report visual symptoms
- 90% have oculomotor problems on testing
- Visual problems often overlooked initially

| Concentric contraction to 45° | 20% |
| Concentric contraction to 30° | 30% |
| Concentric contraction to 15° | 50% |
| Concentric contraction to 5° | 70% |

### Diplopia (Double Vision) (DC 6090)

| Field of Diplopia | Rating |
|-------------------|--------|
| Central 20° | 30% |
| 21-30° | 20% |
| 31-40° | 10% |

| Condition | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Paralysis, complete, of third nerve | 30% |
| Paralysis, complete, of fourth nerve | 30% |
| Paralysis, complete, of sixth nerve | 30% |

### Other Visual Ratings

**Photophobia:**
- Rated by analogy
- Typically 10-30% depending on severity

**Convergence Insufficiency:**
- May be rated under TBI or by analogy
- Functional impairment considered

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From TBI:**
- Service connection documentation
- TBI severity
- Mechanism of injury

**For Vision Problems:**
- Comprehensive eye examination
- Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation
- Visual field testing
- Binocular vision assessment
- Oculomotor testing

### Key Vision Tests

**Visual Acuity:**
- Standard eye chart testing
- Near and distance

**Visual Field Testing:**
- Goldmann or automated perimetry
- Documents any field loss

**Binocular Vision Assessment:**
- Convergence near point
- Cover test
- Eye alignment

**Oculomotor Testing:**
- Tracking ability
- Saccades (quick eye movements)
- Pursuits (smooth tracking)

### The Nexus Letter

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for traumatic brain injury at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnoses:*
*- Convergence insufficiency*
*- Accommodation dysfunction*
*- Photophobia*

*Visual Examination Findings:*
*- Convergence near point: 15 cm (normal <10 cm)*
*- Accommodative amplitude: Reduced*
*- Photosensitivity: Significant*
*- Oculomotor testing: Abnormal saccades and pursuits*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] visual dysfunction is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected traumatic brain injury.*

*Medical Rationale: TBI commonly causes visual and oculomotor dysfunction, affecting 50-75% of patients. The brain pathways controlling eye movements (cranial nerves III, IV, VI, and their central connections) and visual processing are vulnerable to traumatic injury. [Veteran's] constellation of findings—convergence insufficiency, accommodation dysfunction, and photophobia—is characteristic of post-traumatic visual syndrome. The temporal relationship between TBI and visual symptom onset supports causation."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

- Oculomotor testing
- Accommodation testing
- Convergence testing
- Full neurological visual assessment

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get specialist opinion:
- Neuro-ophthalmologist or optometrist with TBI experience
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Claim

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Only seeing regular optometrist** - Need TBI-specific evaluation

2. **Missing binocular vision testing** - Critical for TBI patients

3. **Not documenting functional impact** - Reading, driving, work

4. **Assuming vision is "normal"** - Standard eye chart doesn't catch all TBI vision problems

5. **Missing photophobia** - Common and ratable

6. **Not connecting to TBI** - Must establish nexus

7. **Forgetting reading difficulties** - Convergence/accommodation problems

## Real Veteran Examples

## Related Claims

### Often Associated with TBI Vision

- **Headaches** - Often linked to visual dysfunction
- **Balance problems** - Visual-vestibular connection

## Vision Rehabilitation

### VA Services Available

If service-connected:
- Visual rehabilitation therapy

- Tinted lenses for photophobia
- Computer/reading accommodations

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Vision normal on acuity testing"** - Need binocular/oculomotor testing
2. **"No nexus to TBI"** - Need specialist opinion
3. **"Part of TBI rating"** - Visual problems can be separate

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation
- Comprehensive binocular vision assessment
- Specialist nexus
- Medical literature on TBI visual dysfunction

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: My vision is 20/20 but I have problems. Can I claim?**
A: Yes! Many TBI vision problems don't affect acuity. Binocular and oculomotor issues are different.

**Q: What specialist should I see?**
A: Neuro-ophthalmologist or optometrist with TBI/neuro-optometry training.

**Q: Is light sensitivity ratable?**
A: Yes. Photophobia is rated by analogy.

**Q: Can convergence insufficiency be treated?**
A: Vision therapy can help. Treatment doesn't eliminate the rating.

**Q: What if I'm already rated for TBI?**
A: Visual problems can be rated separately from cognitive/other TBI symptoms.

**Q: Are these vision problems permanent?**
A: Some improve with therapy; many are chronic.

**Q: Can I get special glasses from VA?**
A: If service-connected, VA provides necessary optical aids.
