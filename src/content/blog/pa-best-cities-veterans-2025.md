# Best Cities for Veterans in Pennsylvania 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Pittsburgh ranks **#14 nationally** for best cities for veterans (2024 rankings), making it Pennsylvania's top veteran city. It offers strong job opportunities (defense contractors BAE Systems, Boeing, healthcare giant UPMC), affordable housing (median $210,000), and excellent VA healthcare (two VA campuses). Combined with Pennsylvania's 100% property tax exemption for disabled veterans and military retirement tax exemption, Pittsburgh is outstanding for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees.

Harrisburg and Altoona also rank highly in national veteran city rankings. Harrisburg offers the lowest cost of living among major PA cities (median home $190,000), proximity to military installations (Carlisle Barracks, Fort Indiantown Gap), and a strong veteran community. Altoona ranked **#1 nationally** for veterans buying a house (2025) due to extreme affordability.

Philadelphia is Pennsylvania's largest city (1.6 million) with the most job opportunities, but high local income taxes (3.79%) and cost of living offset benefits for non-disabled veterans. However, 100% disabled veterans save $2,150+ annually on property taxes, making it viable. Erie offers the most affordable housing (median $134,000) with solid VA healthcare and a tight-knit veteran community.

State College (home of Penn State) combines excellent education benefits, low crime, and quality of life, but lacks major VA facilities (nearest is Altoona, 45 minutes) and has limited veteran employment outside the university.

**Overall rankings for Pennsylvania cities:**
1. **Pittsburgh** - Best overall (jobs, VA care, affordability, veteran community)
2. **Harrisburg** - Best for cost of living, military connections
3. **Altoona** - Best for home affordability
4. **Philadelphia** - Best for job opportunities (if you can afford local taxes)
5. **Erie** - Best for extreme affordability, small-town feel
6. **State College** - Best for student veterans using GI Bill

## Philadelphia: Jobs & Opportunity (But Higher Costs)

**Metro Population:** 6.2 million (largest in PA)
**Veteran Population:** 228,000 in metro area
**City Population:** 1.6 million

### Why Philadelphia Ranks High (With Caveats)

Philadelphia offers the most job opportunities in Pennsylvania and world-class education (Penn, Temple, Drexel), but high local income taxes (3.79%) and cost of living create challenges for non-disabled veterans. However, 100% disabled veterans benefit significantly from property tax exemption ($2,150+ annually) and proximity to major VA facilities.

### Cost of Living

**Housing:**
- Median home price: **$250,000** (Philadelphia County)
- Median rent (2-bedroom): **$1,600/month**
- Property tax rate: 0.86% (lowest in PA among major cities)
- Annual property tax: **$2,150** (median home, non-exempt)
- **100% disabled veteran:** $0 property tax (saves $2,150/year)

Philadelphia has lower property tax rates than suburban counties (Montgomery, Bucks, Chester have $5,000-$7,000 annual taxes), but home prices are higher in desirable neighborhoods (Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Rittenhouse Square average $350,000-$500,000).

**Other Costs:**
- Groceries: 10% above national average
- Utilities: $200/month average
- Transportation: $96/month (SEPTA pass)
- Sales tax: **8%** (highest in PA: 6% state + 2% local)
- Income tax: **3.79%** local (city + school district) **applies to military retirement**

**Example Budget (Military Retiree, No Disability):**
- Military retirement: $55,000/year
- PA state income tax: $0 (exempt)
- Local income tax: $2,085 (3.79%)
- Mortgage/rent: $19,200/year ($1,600/month)
- Property tax: $2,150 (if own home)
- Utilities/other: $10,000/year
- **Total expenses:** ~$33,435/year
- **Leftover:** $21,565

**Example (100% Disabled Veteran):**
- Military retirement: $55,000
- VA disability: $40,000
- Total income: $95,000 (VA disability tax-free)
- Local income tax: $2,085 (3.79% on retirement only)
- Property tax: **$0 (exempt)**
- Housing: $19,200
- Utilities/other: $10,000
- **Total expenses:** ~$31,285
- **Leftover:** $63,715

Philadelphia's high local income tax ($2,085 on $55K retirement vs. $1,650 in Pittsburgh on same income) is a significant downside, but the property tax exemption for disabled veterans partially offsets this.

### Why State College Ranks High for Student Veterans

State College is home to Penn State's main campus and offers exceptional education benefits, low crime, high quality of life, and strong veteran student community. However, limited VA facilities and employment outside the university are drawbacks.

### Cost of Living

**Housing:**
