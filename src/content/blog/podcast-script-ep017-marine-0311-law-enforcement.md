**Your 0311 Value**

Similar to Army 11B (Episode 1) but Marines bring unique reputation. Combat arms background, weapons proficiency, fire team/squad leadership, tactical operations, stress management. Employers recognize Marine discipline and standards.

**Career Paths (mirrors 11B):**

**Police Officer:** $59K-$80K+. All major departments recruit Marines. Academy paid. Veteran preference common. Physical fitness standard easy for Marines.

**Federal Law Enforcement:** Border Patrol $52K-$85K. FBI/DEA/ATF $80K-$130K (requires bachelor's). Federal Protective Service $55K-$75K.

**Sheriff/Corrections:** County sheriffs $55K-$75K. Federal BOP $45K base + OT = $60K-$70K.

**Executive Protection:** High-net-worth, corporate executives $71K-$100K+. Marines excel - tactical background, weapons proficiency, situational awareness. Training $3K-$5K (ESI, EPI schools).

**Private Military Contract:** Overseas security $15K-$22K/month. Dangerous, inconsistent work. Not long-term career but can build financial cushion.

**Private Security Management:** Corporate security director $80K-$120K+. Your Marine leadership experience valued for management.

**Unique Marine Advantage:** Marine reputation opens doors. Many police chiefs, sheriffs are former Marines. Networking through Marine veteran organizations powerful for job placement.

**Path Considerations**

Police: Apply 6-12 months out. Background checks take time. Academy 16-26 weeks. Good pensions (20-25 years).

Federal: USAJobs.gov. Veteran preference. Age limits (Border Patrol under 40). Competitive but achievable.

Executive Protection: Need training beyond military. But Marine combat experience provides foundation. Network through security industry associations.

**Skills Translation:** "Conducted combat operations" becomes "Performed security operations in high-stress environments." "Fire team leader" becomes "Managed team of 4 personnel under challenging conditions." Frame military experience in civilian security context.

**Timeline:** 12mo out research agencies, 6-9mo apply positions, 3-6mo interview/background, separation start academy or security position.
