# Radiculopathy Secondary to Spinal Condition: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Extremely common and strong secondary claim
- **Medical nexus required?** YES, but connection is well-established
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-40% per extremity
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected spinal condition, EMG/nerve conduction study, radiculopathy diagnosis, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Very high (80%+) with documented radiculopathy

Radiculopathy (nerve root compression from spinal conditions) is one of the most successful secondary claims. If you have service-connected back or neck problems and experience radiating pain, numbness, or weakness in your arms or legs, you likely have grounds for this claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For radiculopathy secondary to spinal conditions:
- Your back or neck condition must be service-connected
- Radiculopathy must be diagnosed (nerve root involvement)
- Spinal condition must be causing the nerve compression

## What Is Radiculopathy?

### Definition

Radiculopathy is dysfunction of a nerve root, typically caused by:
- Disc herniation compressing nerve
- Bone spur narrowing neural foramen
- Spinal stenosis
- Degenerative disc disease
- Spinal arthritis

### Symptoms by Location

**Cervical Radiculopathy (Neck → Arms):**
- Pain radiating into shoulder, arm, hand
- Numbness/tingling in specific dermatome
- Weakness in arm/hand muscles
- Decreased grip strength
- Loss of reflexes

**Lumbar Radiculopathy (Back → Legs):**
- Pain radiating into buttock, leg, foot
- Numbness/tingling in leg/foot
- Weakness in leg muscles
- Difficulty walking on heels or toes
- Loss of reflexes
- Sciatica (sciatic nerve involvement)

### Common Affected Nerve Roots

**Cervical:**
- C5: Shoulder/upper arm
- C6: Thumb and index finger
- C7: Middle finger
- C8: Ring and little finger

**Lumbar:**
- L3: Front of thigh
- L4: Inner leg, foot
- L5: Outer leg, top of foot, big toe
- S1: Outer foot, little toe

## VA Rating Criteria for Radiculopathy

Radiculopathy is rated under the peripheral nerve codes in 38 CFR § 4.124a.

### Sciatic Nerve (DC 8520) - Most Common

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Moderately severe incomplete paralysis |
| 60% | Severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy |
| 80% | Complete paralysis (foot dangles, no movement below knee) |

### External Popliteal (Peroneal) Nerve (DC 8521)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 30% | Severe incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Complete paralysis (foot drop) |

### Femoral Nerve (DC 8526)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 30% | Severe incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Complete paralysis (quadriceps weakness) |

### Upper Extremity Nerves

**Median Nerve (DC 8515):**
- Mild: 10%
- Moderate: 20-30%
- Severe: 40-50%
- Complete: 60-70%

**Ulnar Nerve (DC 8516):**
- Mild: 10%
- Moderate: 20-30%
- Severe: 30-40%
- Complete: 50-60%

**Radial Nerve (DC 8514):**
- Mild: 20%
- Moderate: 30-40%
- Severe: 40-50%
- Complete: 60-70%

### What Constitutes Mild/Moderate/Severe?

**Mild:**
- Subjective symptoms (pain, tingling)
- Minimal objective findings
- No significant weakness
- Normal or near-normal reflexes

**Moderate:**
- Clear sensory changes
- Mild weakness
- Diminished reflexes
- EMG abnormalities

**Severe:**
- Significant weakness
- Marked sensory loss
- Absent reflexes
- Muscle atrophy
- Significant EMG abnormalities

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Spinal Condition:**
- Service connection documentation
- MRI/CT showing disc or structural abnormalities
- Current spinal rating

**For Radiculopathy:**
- Symptoms documentation
- Physical examination findings
- EMG/Nerve conduction study
- Treatment records

### Key Diagnostic Tests

**EMG/Nerve Conduction Study (Very Important):**
- Confirms nerve involvement
- Identifies specific nerves affected
- Shows severity of damage
- Distinguishes from other conditions

**MRI:**
- Shows disc herniations
- Demonstrates nerve root compression
- Identifies stenosis

**Clinical Examination:**
- Dermatomal sensory changes
- Myotomal weakness
- Reflex changes
- Positive nerve tension signs (straight leg raise)

### The Nexus Letter

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Neurologist or spine specialist
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Radiculopathy diagnosis with specific nerves**
4. **Connection to spinal condition**
5. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including spinal imaging and electrodiagnostic studies. [Veteran] is service-connected for lumbar degenerative disc disease at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Left L5-S1 lumbar radiculopathy*

*Supporting Evidence:*
*- MRI: L5-S1 disc herniation with left L5 nerve root compression*
*- EMG: Abnormal with left L5 denervation changes*
*- Physical examination: Positive left straight leg raise, decreased left ankle reflex, weakness of left great toe extension*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] left lumbar radiculopathy is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected lumbar degenerative disc disease.*

*Medical Rationale: The MRI clearly demonstrates disc pathology at L5-S1 with impingement on the left L5 nerve root. The EMG findings confirm L5 radiculopathy. The clinical presentation with dermatomal pain, sensory changes, reflex loss, and weakness is entirely consistent with L5 nerve root compression from the documented disc disease. The causal relationship is anatomically and pathophysiologically clear."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Document Your Symptoms

Track and report:
- Radiating pain (where it goes)
- Numbness/tingling areas
- Any weakness
- Impact on daily activities

### Step 2: Request EMG/Nerve Conduction Study

Critical for confirmation:
- Ask your provider for referral
- VA neurology can perform
- Documents objective nerve damage

### Step 3: Obtain Current MRI

Shows structural cause:
- If recent MRI exists, ensure it's in your records
- If no recent MRI, request one
- Correlates structure to symptoms

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get physician opinion:
- Neurology or spine specialist preferred
- Must identify specific nerve roots
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Specify which extremity/extremities
- Link to spinal condition
- Upload evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Neurological examination expected
- Examiner tests sensation, strength, reflexes
- Be honest about symptoms
- Describe worst days, not best

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not getting EMG** - Strongest objective evidence

2. **Not specifying which extremity** - Each can be rated separately

3. **Waiting too long** - Document when symptoms start

4. **Vague symptoms** - Be specific about radiation pattern

5. **Forgetting both legs** - If bilateral, claim both

6. **Missing upper extremity** - Neck conditions can cause arm radiculopathy

7. **Not reporting all symptoms** - Weakness matters as much as pain

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Lumbar Radiculopathy Bilateral

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, 40% lumbar DDD
- Bilateral leg pain for 5 years
- Numbness in both feet
- EMG shows bilateral L5-S1 radiculopathy

**Evidence:**
- MRI: L4-5 and L5-S1 disc herniations
- EMG: Bilateral L5-S1 involvement
- Neurologist nexus

**Outcome:**
- Right lower extremity: 20% (moderate)
- Left lower extremity: 20% (moderate)
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 60%

### Case Study 2: Cervical Radiculopathy

**Background:** 45-year-old veteran, 20% cervical strain
- Right arm numbness and weakness
- Decreased grip strength
- EMG confirms C6-7 radiculopathy

**Evidence:**
- MRI: C6-7 disc herniation
- EMG: Right C6-7 radiculopathy
- Positive Spurling's test

**Outcome:** 20% for right upper extremity radiculopathy
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 36% (rounds to 40%)

### Case Study 3: Sciatica Progression

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, 20% lumbar strain
- Left leg pain worsening
- Foot drop developing
- Significant weakness

**Evidence:**
- EMG showing severe S1 involvement
- Physical exam: Weakness 3/5, absent ankle reflex
- MRI: Large L5-S1 herniation

**Outcome:** 40% for left lower extremity (moderately severe)
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 52% (rounds to 50%)

## Bilateral Considerations

### Can You Claim Both Sides?

**Yes.** Each extremity is rated separately.

**Example:**
- Right leg radiculopathy: 20%
- Left leg radiculopathy: 10%
- Both added to combined rating
- Bilateral factor may apply (additional 10%)

### Bilateral Factor

If both legs or both arms affected:
- Ratings combined first
- Then 10% of combined value added
- Then added to other ratings

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Single Extremity 20%:**
- Before: 40% spine = $524.31
- Add 20% radiculopathy = 52% → rounds to 50%
- After: $1,041.82
- Increase: $517.51/month

**Bilateral 20% Each:**
- Before: 40% spine
- Add 20% + 20% with bilateral factor
- Combined significantly higher
- Substantial monthly increase

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No confirmed radiculopathy"** - Need EMG
2. **"Not related to spinal condition"** - Need clearer nexus
3. **"Symptoms part of back rating"** - Radiculopathy is separate

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add EMG if not done
- Add stronger nexus from neurologist
- MRI showing nerve compression
- Document symptom progression

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is sciatica the same as radiculopathy?**
A: Sciatica is a type of lumbar radiculopathy involving the sciatic nerve.

**Q: Do I need an EMG?**
A: Not absolutely required, but it's the strongest objective evidence.

**Q: Can I claim both legs?**
A: Yes, if both are affected. Each is rated separately.

**Q: What if my back is only rated 10%?**
A: You can still have radiculopathy. The nerve damage is rated separately.

**Q: Does radiculopathy rating stack with back rating?**
A: Yes. They're different diagnostic codes and combined (not added).

**Q: What if pain comes and goes?**
A: Still claim it. Intermittent radiculopathy is still radiculopathy.

**Q: Can arm radiculopathy come from neck condition?**
A: Absolutely. Cervical conditions cause upper extremity radiculopathy.
