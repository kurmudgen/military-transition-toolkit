# VA Vocational Rehabilitation (VR&E): Complete Guide to Chapter 31 Benefits

## Bottom Line Up Front

**VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)**, also called Chapter 31 or "Voc Rehab," helps veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for and find suitable employment. It can be **better than the GI Bill** in many cases: longer duration, additional support services, and doesn't use your GI Bill months. If you have a **service-connected disability of 10%+** with an employment handicap, VR&E may be your best path to education and career success.

## What Is VR&E?

VR&E is a VA program that provides:
- Career counseling
- Job training
- Education (tuition, books, supplies)
- Job placement assistance
- Subsistence allowance (monthly payment)
- Additional support services

**Key difference from GI Bill:** VR&E focuses on overcoming barriers to employment caused by your disability, not just education.

## Eligibility

### Basic Requirements

1. **Service-connected disability** of 10% or more, AND
2. **Employment handicap** (your disability creates barriers to employment)

### Employment Handicap

An "employment handicap" means your service-connected disability:
- Limits your career options
- Makes employment preparation difficult
- Creates significant barriers to finding/keeping suitable work

**Serious Employment Handicap:** More severe limitations that significantly impair your ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment.

### Time Limit

Generally, you must apply within **12 years** of:
- VA notification of service-connected disability rating, OR
- Discharge from active duty

**Exceptions:** The time limit can be extended if you have a serious employment handicap.

## The Five Tracks

VR&E offers five different tracks based on your needs:

### Track 1: Reemployment

**For:** Veterans who want to return to their previous job
**Services:** Job accommodations, employer engagement, advocacy

### Track 2: Rapid Access to Employment

**For:** Veterans who already have job skills but need employment assistance
**Services:** Job search assistance, resume help, interview prep, job placement

### Track 3: Self-Employment

**For:** Veterans who want to start their own business
**Services:** Business plan development, training, startup costs (in some cases)

### Track 4: Employment Through Long-Term Services

**For:** Veterans who need education or training to become employable
**Services:** College, vocational training, apprenticeships, OJT, subsistence allowance

**This is the track most similar to GI Bill** and is the most common.

### Track 5: Independent Living

**For:** Veterans whose disabilities are too severe for employment
**Services:** Services to improve independence and quality of life

|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Eligibility | 10%+ SC disability | Service time |

## Key Takeaways

1. **If you have 10%+ disability, explore VR&E** - It may be better than GI Bill

7. **Apply early** - Process takes time

VR&E is an underused benefit that can provide more support than the GI Bill alone. If you qualify, it's worth exploring.
