## Should You Sell Back Leave or Take Terminal Leave?
**By Jacob, Navy E6 | Formation Labs**

## THE $10,000 DECISION

Terminal leave is one of your final military decisions that can mean thousands of dollars difference. This workbook helps you calculate whether to take terminal leave, sell it back, or use a combination.

## YOUR OPTIONS

**OPTION 1: Take Full Terminal Leave**
Stop working, get paid, transition while collecting paycheck

**OPTION 2: Sell Back Leave**
Keep working until ETS, get lump sum for unused leave (max 60 days)

**OPTION 3: Hybrid**
Take some terminal leave, sell back the rest

## TERMINAL LEAVE CALCULATOR

**Your Numbers:**
- Days of leave accumulated: _____ days
- Base pay (monthly): $_______
- BAH (monthly): $_______
- BAS (monthly): $_______
- Separation date: _______

**Terminal Leave Value:**
(Base Pay + BAH + BAS) ÷ 30 days × Leave Days = Terminal Leave Pay

**Example (E-5, 45 days leave):**
($3,200 + $2,100 + $460) ÷ 30 × 45 = **$8,640**

**Sell Back Value (Max 60 Days):**
Base Pay ÷ 30 days × Leave Days = Sell Back Amount
**ONLY base pay, NO BAH/BAS**

**Example (E-5, 45 days):**
$3,200 ÷ 30 × 45 = **$4,800**

**Difference: $3,840** (Terminal leave pays more)

## WHEN TO TAKE TERMINAL LEAVE

✅ You don't have a job lined up yet
✅ You need time to job search without stress
✅ You want to relocate before starting civilian job
✅ You need time for certifications/training
✅ BAH in your area is substantial
✅ You want seamless transition (keep getting paid while settling in)

**Terminal leave gives you financial runway to transition properly.**

## WHEN TO SELL BACK LEAVE

✅ You have civilian job starting immediately
✅ New job pays significantly more than military
✅ You need lump sum cash (down payment, moving costs, emergency fund)
✅ Your BAH is very low (terminal leave less valuable)
✅ You're maxed at 60 days (can only sell back 60, take rest)

**Selling back makes sense if new job pays more than terminal leave.**

## THE HYBRID STRATEGY

**Best of both worlds:**
- Take 30 days terminal leave (transition time)
- Sell back 30 days (lump sum cash)

**Example:**
- 60 total leave days
- Take 30 terminal: $5,760 spread over month
- Sell 30 days: $3,200 lump sum
- **Total value: $8,960**

**This gives you transition time AND cash in hand.**

## SCENARIO CALCULATOR

**SCENARIO 1: E-6, 60 days leave, high BAH area**
- Base: $3,800/month
- BAH: $2,800/month
- BAS: $460/month
- **Terminal value:** $14,120
- **Sell back value:** $7,600
- **Best choice: TERMINAL LEAVE** (save $6,520)

**SCENARIO 2: E-4, 45 days, new job paying $75K**
- Terminal value: $6,750 over 45 days
- New job: $75K/year = $6,250/month
- **Sell back:** $3,200 lump sum + start job faster
- **Best choice: SELL BACK** (start earning civilian salary sooner)

**SCENARIO 3: E-7, 75 days leave (can only sell 60 max)**
- 75 days total leave
- Take 15 days terminal (required, exceeds sell-back limit)
- Sell back 60 days (maximum allowed)
- **No choice: Must take 15 as terminal, sell 60**

## TAX IMPLICATIONS

**Terminal Leave:**
- Taxed as regular pay (spread over time)
- Lower tax bracket impact

**Sell Back:**
- Lump sum (may push into higher tax bracket temporarily)
- Still subject to federal tax, FICA
- NOT taxed by states that don't tax military pay

**Example:**
$10,000 sell-back in 22% bracket = $2,200 federal tax
$10,000 terminal over 2 months = likely same bracket, but spread out

**Generally minor difference, but consider if near bracket threshold.**

## HEALTHCARE CONSIDERATIONS

**Terminal Leave:**
✓ Tricare continues entire terminal leave period
✓ Full military benefits maintained
✓ Can use MTF and pharmacy

**Sell Back:**
❌ Tricare ends on separation date
❌ Need to arrange civilian insurance immediately
❌ Potential coverage gap

**If you need medical care or have family, terminal leave keeps healthcare active longer.**

## DECISION TREE

**START: Do you have 60+ days leave?**
→ YES: Must take excess as terminal, can sell max 60
→ NO: Continue

**Do you have a civilian job starting within 30 days?**
→ YES: Consider selling back or short terminal
→ NO: TAKE TERMINAL LEAVE

**Does your new job pay 50%+ more than military?**
→ YES: Consider selling back to start job sooner
→ NO: TAKE TERMINAL LEAVE

**Do you need lump sum cash for moving/housing deposit?**
→ YES: Consider hybrid (take some, sell some)
→ NO: TAKE TERMINAL LEAVE

**Is your BAH very high ($2,500+)?**
→ YES: TERMINAL LEAVE MORE VALUABLE
→ NO: Less difference between options

## LEAVE ACCRUAL RATES

**Annual Leave Accrual:**
- 0-3 years: 2.5 days/month (30 days/year)
- 3-6 years: 2.5 days/month (30 days/year)
- 6-10 years: 2.5 days/month (30 days/year)
- 10-15 years: 3.0 days/month (36 days/year)
- 15-20 years: 3.5 days/month (42 days/year)
- 20+ years: 4.0 days/month (48 days/year)

**Maximum Accumulation:**
- 60 days maximum carryover (use-or-lose)
- Special Leave Accrual (SLA) during deployment can exceed 60

**If you're separating with 80 days:**
- Must use 20 days before separation OR
- Take 20 days terminal + sell 60 days OR
- Take all 80 days terminal (sell-back limited to 60)

## WORKSHEET: YOUR SITUATION

**My Leave Balance:** _____ days

**My Monthly Pay:**
- Base Pay: $_______

**New Job Status:**
□ Have job starting: _______ (date)
□ New salary: $_______/year ($_______/month)
□ No job yet (take terminal)

**My Decision:**

□ Hybrid: Take _____ days terminal, sell _____ days

**Reason:**
_________________________________

## COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **Mistake #1:** Not checking leave balance early
✓ **Solution:** Check 6 months before separation, plan accordingly

❌ **Mistake #2:** Assuming you can sell back all leave
✓ **Solution:** 60 day maximum on sell-back

❌ **Mistake #3:** Not considering BAH value
✓ **Solution:** Include full pay (base+BAH+BAS) in terminal leave calculation

❌ **Mistake #4:** Forgetting healthcare coverage
✓ **Solution:** Terminal leave extends Tricare, selling back doesn't

❌ **Mistake #5:** Not using terminal leave for transition time
✓ **Solution:** Terminal leave is paid job-search time - use it!

## ACTION STEPS

**6 Months Before Separation:**
□ Check current leave balance
□ Calculate terminal leave value vs. sell-back value
□ Assess job search status
□ Decide tentative strategy

**3 Months Before:**
□ Finalize terminal leave vs. sell-back decision
□ Submit terminal leave request (if taking terminal)
□ Coordinate with command on transition timeline
□ Arrange civilian healthcare if selling back

**1 Month Before:**
□ Confirm terminal leave approval
□ Verify final out-processing timeline
□ Ensure leave balance accurate in system
□ Coordinate final day of work
