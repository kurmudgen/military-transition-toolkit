# Utah Best Cities for Veterans 2025: Housing Costs, Benefits & Quality of Life

Utah ranks among the most desirable states for military retirees thanks to outstanding outdoor recreation, strong economy, low veteran unemployment (0.9%), generous property tax exemptions (up to $521,620), and full military retirement income tax exemption. With approximately 150,000 veterans calling Utah home, the state offers diverse living options from mountain resort towns to urban centers to desert communities.

But where should you actually live? Utah's cities vary dramatically in housing costs (Lehi/Park City are expensive), altitude (4,000-7,000 feet—respiratory concerns), veteran population density, job opportunities, and access to VA healthcare.

This guide ranks Utah's best cities for veterans with real data on home prices, veteran populations, and quality of life factors.

**Best for affordability:** Ogden, Provo, Logan
**Best for healthcare access:** Salt Lake City/Murray (George E. Wahlen VAMC)

**State average:** ~$500,000
