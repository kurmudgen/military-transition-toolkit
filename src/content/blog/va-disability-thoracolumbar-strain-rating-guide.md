# VA Disability Rating for Thoracolumbar Strain: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Thoracolumbar strain (mid and lower back) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 5237** with ratings from **10% to 100%**. This uses the same rating criteria as lumbosacral strain. The thoracolumbar spine includes T1-L5. Most veterans receive **10-20%** for limitation of motion. Lower extremity radiculopathy (nerve symptoms in legs) is rated **separately**. This is one of the most common VA claims due to the physical demands of military service. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Thoracolumbar Strain?

Thoracolumbar strain involves injury to the muscles, ligaments, and structures of the thoracic (T1-T12) and lumbar (L1-L5) spine. This region is commonly injured in military service.

**Related conditions:**
- Thoracolumbar strain/sprain
- Degenerative disc disease
- Degenerative joint disease (arthritis)
- Herniated/bulging discs
- Spinal stenosis
- Spondylolisthesis

**Military causes:**
- Heavy lifting and carrying
- Rucking with heavy loads
- Repetitive bending
- Vehicle operations/accidents
- Airborne operations
- Combat operations
- Poor ergonomics

## VA Rating Criteria

Same as lumbosacral strain under **38 CFR § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Spine**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Forward flexion >60° but ≤85°; OR combined ROM >120° but ≤235°; OR muscle spasm/guarding not causing abnormal gait |
| **20%** | Forward flexion >30° but ≤60°; OR combined ROM ≤120°; OR muscle spasm/guarding causing abnormal gait or spinal contour |
| **40%** | Forward flexion 30° or less; OR favorable ankylosis of entire thoracolumbar spine |
| **50%** | Unfavorable ankylosis of entire thoracolumbar spine |
| **100%** | Unfavorable ankylosis of entire spine |

**Normal thoracolumbar ROM:**
- Forward flexion: 0-90°
- Extension: 0-30°
- Left/right lateral flexion: 0-30° each
- Left/right rotation: 0-30° each
- **Combined ROM: 240°**

## Key Points

- Rate based on range of motion OR incapacitating episodes (whichever is higher)
- Lower extremity radiculopathy rated separately
- Document flare-ups—they can support higher ratings
- Pain on motion matters—report where pain begins

## Evidence You Need

Same as lumbosacral strain:
- Service treatment records
- Current imaging (MRI, X-ray)
- Range of motion measurements
- Documentation of radiculopathy symptoms
- Treatment records

## Secondary Conditions

**Claim separately:**
- Lower extremity radiculopathy (each leg)
- Hip conditions (from gait changes)
- Knee conditions (compensation)

**Can be secondary to:**
- Leg length discrepancy
- Other orthopedic conditions
