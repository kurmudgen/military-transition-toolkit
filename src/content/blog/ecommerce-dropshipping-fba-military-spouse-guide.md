# E-commerce for Military Spouses: Dropshipping vs FBA Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

E-commerce offers military spouses location-independent income selling physical products without managing inventory headaches. **Dropshipping** requires **$100-$500 to start** and works from anywhere, but margins are thin (15-30%) and customer service demands are high. **Amazon FBA** requires **$2,500-$10,000 to start** and Amazon handles fulfillment, but inventory investment and prep logistics create PCS challenges. Both can generate **$1,000-$10,000+/month** once established. The right choice depends on your startup capital, risk tolerance, and PCS timeline.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Physical retail businesses seem incompatible with military life—who wants to move inventory every PCS? But modern e-commerce models solve this:

**Dropshipping:** You never touch inventory. Supplier ships directly to customer.

**Amazon FBA:** You send inventory to Amazon. They store, pack, and ship everything.

Both models let you run a product business from anywhere with an internet connection. The question isn't whether e-commerce works for military spouses—it's which model fits your situation.

## Dropshipping Explained

### How It Works

1. Customer orders from your online store
2. You forward order to supplier
3. Supplier ships directly to customer
4. You keep the difference between selling price and supplier cost

### Dropshipping Pros

**Low Startup Cost:** $100-$500 to launch
- Shopify store: $29/month
- Domain: $12/year
- Initial marketing: $50-$300
- No inventory investment

**Zero Inventory Risk:** Never buy products until they're sold

**Location Independent:** Works from any duty station, including OCONUS

**Easy to Pivot:** Test products without financial commitment

**No Shipping Logistics:** Supplier handles everything

### Dropshipping Cons

**Low Margins:** 15-30% typical (vs. 50%+ with owned inventory)

**Quality Control Issues:** You never see products before customers do

**Shipping Times:** Many suppliers ship from China (15-30 days)

**High Competition:** Low barriers mean many sellers

**Customer Service Burden:** You're responsible for supplier mistakes

**Supplier Reliability:** Your business depends on their performance

## PCS Considerations

### Dropshipping During PCS

**Impact Level: Minimal**

- Business runs entirely online
- No physical inventory to move
- Pause ads temporarily if needed
- Customer service can continue anywhere

**Best Practices:**
- Set customer service hours that work across time zones
- Have email templates for common issues
- Pause heavy ad spending during chaotic move days
- Resume within 1-2 weeks of arrival

### FBA During PCS

**Impact Level: Moderate to Significant**

**Challenges:**
- Physical prep supplies need to move
- May have inventory at your location
- Shipments to Amazon need address updates
- Can't easily pause Amazon listings

**Solutions:**

**Use Prep Centers:**
- Third-party companies receive, prep, and ship to Amazon
- Cost: $1-3 per unit
- Eliminates home-based prep entirely
- PCS becomes nearly irrelevant

**Popular Prep Centers:**
- AMZ Prep Services
- MyPrepCenter
- FBAforward

**Inventory Management:**
- Don't overstock before PCS
- Time large shipments for after settlement
- Use Amazon's "vacation settings" if needed
- Consider 3PL for large operations

### OCONUS Considerations

**Dropshipping OCONUS:**
- Works seamlessly (business is 100% digital)
- Time zone differences can benefit customer service coverage
- Ensure payment processor works internationally

**FBA OCONUS:**
- Continue selling, but prep becomes harder
- Prep centers essential
- Can't easily do retail/online arbitrage
- Shipping products internationally to Amazon expensive

### Reality Check

Most people who try dropshipping or FBA don't reach significant profitability. Success requires:
- **6-12 months** of consistent effort
- Willingness to fail and iterate
- Marketing skills (dropshipping) or operations skills (FBA)
- Capital to survive learning period
- Treating it as a real business, not a side hustle hack

## Which Model Should You Choose?

### Choose Dropshipping If:

- You have limited startup capital (<$500)
- You're uncertain about long-term commitment
- PCS moves happen frequently
- You want to test e-commerce before investing heavily
- You're comfortable with marketing and ads
- You can handle customer service frustrations

### Choose FBA If:

- You have $3,000+ to invest
- You're at a stable duty station for 2+ years
- You want higher potential margins
- You prefer Amazon's built-in traffic
- You're comfortable with operations and logistics
- You can use prep centers or have prep space

### Consider Print-on-Demand If:

- You're creative/design-oriented
- You want custom, unique products
- You want dropshipping simplicity with better branding
- You're building around personal brand

### Consider Neither If:

- You need immediate income (service businesses faster)
- You're risk-averse with money
- You don't have 10+ hours/week to dedicate
- You're looking for passive income (e-commerce isn't passive initially)
