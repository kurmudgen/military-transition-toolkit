---# SEO Backlink Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive backlink acquisition strategy for building domain authority and driving referral traffic. Includes target link sources, outreach templates, and realistic execution plan for solo founders.

---

## Backlink Fundamentals

### Why Backlinks Matter

**SEO Impact:**
- Domain Authority (DA) - Higher DA = better rankings
- Page Authority (PA) - Specific page ranking power
- Referral Traffic - Direct visitors from linking sites
- Faster Indexing - Google discovers content faster
- Trust Signals - Quality backlinks = trustworthy site

**Quality vs. Quantity:**
- 1 link from VA.gov (DA 95) > 100 links from spam sites
- Relevant links (military/veteran sites) > irrelevant links
- Editorial links (earned) > paid/spammy links
- Dofollow links (pass authority) > Nofollow links

### Link Quality Metrics

**High-Value Links (Target These):**
- DA 50+ sites
- Relevant to veterans/military
- Editorial content (not sponsored)
- Dofollow links
- Contextual (in article body, not footer)

**Low-Value Links (Avoid):**
- Spam/PBN sites
- Unrelated niches
- Paid link schemes
- Footer/sidebar links only
- Link farms

---

## Backlink Quality Checks

### Before Pursuing a Link, Ask:

4. **Does the site look legitimate?** (Not spammy, real content)
5. **Will this link pass authority?** (Dofollow? Contextual?)

### Red Flags (Avoid These Sites):

❌ Spam score >30% (check with Moz, Ahrefs)
❌ Obvious PBN (Private Blog Network)
❌ Unrelated content (foreign language, totally different niche)
❌ No real traffic (check SimilarWeb estimates)
❌ Footer/sidebar links only (low value)
