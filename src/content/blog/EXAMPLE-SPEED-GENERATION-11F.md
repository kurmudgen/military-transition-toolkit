4. Move to next guide

---

## TOTAL TIME BREAKDOWN

- Research: 60-90 minutes
- Writing: 60 minutes
- Quality check: 10 minutes
- Save/admin: 5 minutes

**Total: 135-165 minutes (2.25-2.75 hours)**

---

## EFFICIENCY TIPS FOR THIS AFSC

1. **All pilot AFSCs share similar research:**
   - Airline career path details are identical for 11F, 11R, 12F, 12R, 18X
   - Corporate aviation path is the same
   - Company lists nearly identical
   - **Do 11F thoroughly, then copy-paste and adapt for other pilot AFSCs**

2. **Salary research reusable:**
   - Once you have airline salary data, it applies to all pilot AFSCs
   - Corporate aviation data reusable
   - Test pilot data reusable

3. **Batch pilot AFSCs:**
   - Complete all pilot guides (11F, 11R, 12F, 12R, 18X) in one session
   - Estimated time: 6 hours for 5 guides instead of 12 hours individual
   - 50% time savings through reuse

4. **Template sections:**
   - Interview questions about "why leaving military" are universal
   - Resume translation principles similar across pilots
   - Common mistakes similar (waiting too long to apply, etc.)

---

## NEXT AFSC SUGGESTION

After completing 11F, do **18X (RPA Pilot)** next because:
- 80% of research overlaps (airlines don't care fighter vs RPA)
- Same companies, same salaries, same certifications
- Only differences: RPA-specific experience description, slightly different skills section
- Can complete in 90 minutes instead of 150 minutes

Then do other pilot AFSCs in sequence: 11R, 12F, 12R

**Total time for all 5 pilot AFSCs: 7-8 hours (1.5 hours each after first)**

---

This walkthrough demonstrates the systematic, efficient approach. The first guide in a category takes longest. Subsequent similar AFSCs get progressively faster through research reuse and template adaptation.

**Now execute this process for all 124 remaining AFSCs!**
