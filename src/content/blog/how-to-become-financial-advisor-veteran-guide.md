   - Training programs available
   - Support staff
   - Better for starting out

2. **Independent practices** (small 5-20 person firms)

   - Less support
   - Require more independence

3. **Insurance companies** (offer financial planning + insurance products)
   - Sales-heavy culture
   - Commission-based
   - Strong training programs

**Interview:**
- They ask about sales ability, client relations, ambition

   - Ask for introductions
   - Cold prospecting (makes calls to strangers)

   - Friends, family, military buddies
   - Ask them to introduce you to others

   - Inbound inquiries from marketing
   - Usually limited

**Reality:** Most advisors spend 50% time on client acquisition first 2 years. Grueling work.

**Your advantage:** Military network is huge. Friends from service, fellow vets, military communities. You have natural referral base.

**Realistic timeline:**
- Month 1-3: 10-20 clients ($1-2M AUM)

**Reality:** Doesn't matter. Firms will train you.

**Solution:**
- Study for Series 7/65 (learns fundamentals)
- Firm provides compliance/product training
- After 6-12 months, you know enough to advise clients

### Challenge #2: "Cold Calling Sounds Terrifying"

**Reality:** It is. But it works. Most successful advisors cold-call early.

- As book grows, referrals increase (less cold-calling)
- After 3 years, 80%+ of new clients from referrals

**Reality:** You can learn. Most people think they're not salespeople until they have to be.

**Military advantage:** You've already done this. Leading people, explaining complex things, persuading—that's sales.

**Why it works:** You're not selling used cars. You're advising people on their financial future. People trust you. It's easier than it sounds.
