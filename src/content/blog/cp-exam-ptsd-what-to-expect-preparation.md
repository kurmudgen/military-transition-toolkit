# C&P Exam for PTSD: What to Expect and Complete Preparation Guide

The Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam is a critical step in VA disability claims evaluation. For PTSD claims, the C&P exam often determines your rating percentage, directly impacting monthly compensation. Understanding what to expect, how to prepare effectively, and how to present your symptoms honestly yet comprehensively can significantly influence your rating outcome. This complete guide prepares you for success in your PTSD C&P exam.

## Understanding the PTSD C&P Exam

The VA uses C&P exams to assess symptoms, functional impairment, and occupational capacity. For PTSD, the exam evaluates:
- Symptom severity and frequency
- Combat exposure or service-related trauma details
- Occupational and social impairment
- Daily functioning limitations
- Current treatment and medication
- Suicide/self-harm risk
- Relationship status and functioning

The examiner—typically a psychiatrist, psychologist, or nurse practitioner—conducts a comprehensive interview and mental status examination lasting 45-90 minutes.

## Key Information the VA Evaluates

### Combat Exposure and Trauma Details

Examiners verify service connection by asking detailed questions about traumatic events:
- Where were you stationed?
- What was your military occupational specialty?
- Describe the traumatic event(s) causing PTSD
- Were you in direct combat or support role?
- What was your unit's mission?
- Did you witness casualties or death?
- Were you injured in combat?

**Preparation Strategy**: Have your discharge papers available showing unit, location, and dates. Be specific about traumatic events without graphic oversharing. If unable to recall details, state that honestly—PTSD often impairs memory.

### Symptom Frequency and Severity

Examiners assess specific PTSD symptoms:
- Nightmares: Frequency (nightly, several times weekly, weekly, etc.)
- Flashbacks: How often do you experience them?
- Hypervigilance: Constant awareness of surroundings?
- Startle response: How exaggerated is your reaction?
- Avoidance: What specific triggers do you avoid?
- Intrusive thoughts: How often do combat memories intrude?
- Sleep disruption: How often do PTSD symptoms prevent sleep?
- Anger/irritability: Frequency and intensity

**Preparation Strategy**: Track symptoms for 2-3 weeks pre-exam in a journal. Note nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety episodes with frequency and impact. This documentation strengthens your testimony.

### Occupational Impairment

Examiners assess ability to maintain employment:
- Current employment status?
- If unemployed: Why can't you work?
- If employed: What accommodations do you need?
- Have you lost jobs due to PTSD?
- Concentration or decision-making difficulties affecting work?
- Difficulty with authority figures or supervision?
- Social interaction problems with coworkers?
- Attendance or punctuality issues?

**Preparation Strategy**: Document all employment changes. If unemployed, clearly explain PTSD preventing work. If employed, detail specific accommodations (remote work, reduced hours, etc.). Bring employer statement if available documenting PTSD impact.

### Social and Relationship Impairment

Examiners assess relationship functioning:
- Relationship status (married, divorced, single)?
- Any divorces or separations?
- Children, custody status?
- Social participation (do you avoid social situations)?
- Friendship/family relationships quality?
- Intimacy/sexual relationship status?
- Family conflict from PTSD?
- Isolation due to PTSD?

**Preparation Strategy**: Be honest about relationship impacts. If PTSD caused divorce or strained relationships, mention this. If isolated, explain why. This demonstrates functional impairment justifying higher ratings.

### Current Treatment

Examiners review all PTSD treatment:
- What medications are you taking?
- How long have you been on these medications?
- Have other medications been tried?
- Are you in therapy or counseling?
- How often do you see mental health providers?
- Hospital or inpatient psychiatric care?
- Emergency psychiatric visits?
- Response to treatments

**Preparation Strategy**: Bring updated medication list with dosages. Note all medications tried and why discontinued. Bring therapy/counseling frequency documentation. This shows appropriate treatment engagement.

### Safety Assessment

Examiners assess suicide and self-harm risk:
- Ever had suicidal thoughts?
- Ever attempted suicide?
- Current suicidal ideation?
- Plan or intent?
- Self-harm behaviors?
- Substance abuse as coping mechanism?

**Preparation Strategy**: Answer honestly. Current suicidal ideation doesn't disqualify disability rating—in fact, it may support higher ratings if present. However, if actively suicidal, the examiner may initiate crisis intervention. Previous suicide attempts are important historical information.

## What to Bring to Your Exam

**Essential Documents:**
- Appointment notice and insurance card
- Discharge papers (DD Form 214)
- Military identification if available
- Photo identification

**Supporting Documentation:**
- Medication list with dosages
- Recent psychiatric or mental health records
- Hospital records if admitted for psychiatric care
- Therapy or counseling documentation
- Employer statement (if available)
- Personal statement describing PTSD impact
- Journal of recent symptoms

**Optional but Helpful:**
- Letters from family describing PTSD impact
- Service member statements about combat exposure
- Any awards/commendations showing service status
- Proof of ongoing treatment (therapy scheduling, medication refills)

## C&P Exam Day Strategy

### Arrive Early

Arrive 10-15 minutes early. This shows commitment and allows time to calm pre-exam anxiety. Rushing increases stress-induced anxiety that may affect your presentation.

### Manage Anxiety

The exam itself may trigger anxiety. Strategies:
- Deep breathing before entering exam room
- Remind yourself that honest testimony helps your case
- You're not being judged—the exam evaluates your symptoms
- Previous successful exams/treatments indicate you can handle this

### Present Professionally

While your symptoms don't require an apology:
- Wear clean, appropriate clothing (not military uniform)
- Maintain reasonable eye contact (hypervigilant avoidance of eye contact is noted)
- Speak clearly enough to be understood
- Don't minimize symptoms or try to "perform better"

### Honest Symptom Description

**Effective symptom description:**
- Instead of: "I have nightmares sometimes"
- Say: "I have nightmares 4-5 times weekly where I wake gasping for breath, drenched in sweat, believing I'm back in combat. It takes 30+ minutes to calm down"

**Specificity matters:**
- Instead of: "Loud noises bother me"
- Say: "Fireworks or backfiring cars cause immediate heart racing, panic, and I must leave the situation. It takes hours to calm down"

**Frequency documentation:**
- Instead of: "I avoid crowds"
- Say: "I don't go to restaurants, movies, or public events. The crowd density triggers hypervigilance. I can't sit with my back exposed. I need exits visible at all times"

### Address Functional Impact

Clearly connect symptoms to functional limitations:
- "My nightmares prevent sleep, leaving me exhausted. I can't concentrate at work. I've missed work days and eventually lost jobs because of this"
- "Hypervigilance means I can't relax. My marriage suffered because I couldn't be intimate. My wife said she felt like she was married to a soldier in a warzone, not her husband"
- "Anger outbursts from PTSD damaged my relationship with my kids. My ex-wife used PTSD as reason for custody reduction"

### Don't Exaggerate, but Don't Minimize

The VA pays for disability, not perfect function. Being honest about difficulties is appropriate:
- **Honest**: "Some days are better than others. Bad days, I can't get out of bed. Good days, I can function at work"
- **Not**: "I'm completely incapacitated" or "I do fine, just occasional nightmares"

## Questions You'll Likely Be Asked

**Service History:**
- What was your military occupation?
- How long did you serve?
- Were you deployed? Where? When?
- What was your unit's mission?
- How many deployments?

**Trauma Details:**
- Describe the specific event(s) causing PTSD
- What happened to you?
- What did you witness?
- Were you injured?
- Were people killed?
- Did you feel your life was in danger?

**Current Symptoms:**
- How often do you have nightmares?
- Do you have flashbacks?
- Describe your typical day—how does PTSD affect it?
- Do you startle easily?
- What triggers your symptoms?
- What do you do to cope?

**Occupational Impact:**
- Are you currently working?
- Why not working (if unemployed)?
- Have you lost jobs?
- What accommodations do you need at work?
- Can you concentrate?
- Can you follow directions?
- Can you work around others?

**Relationship/Social:**
- Are you married?
- How does PTSD affect your relationship?
- Do you have friends?
- Do you participate in social activities?
- How do you spend your time?
- Do you isolate yourself?

**Treatment:**
- What medications are you taking?
- How long have you been on them?
- Do they help?
- Are you in therapy?
- How often?
- How has treatment helped?

**Safety:**
- Have you ever thought about hurting yourself?
- Have you attempted suicide?
- Do you have thoughts of harming others?
- Do you use alcohol or drugs?

## Mental Status Examination Component

The examiner will observe:
- Appearance: Grooming, hygiene, clothing appropriateness
- Behavior: Agitation, withdrawal, appropriate interaction
- Speech: Rate, volume, coherence
- Mood: How do you describe feeling?
- Affect: Does facial expression match mood?
- Thought Process: Organized, coherent?
- Concentration: Can you follow questions?
- Memory: Can you recall details?
- Judgment: Do decisions seem reasonable?
- Insight: Do you understand you have PTSD?

**Preparation Strategy**: Don't try to appear "normal." PTSD symptoms visible during exam (startle response to loud noise, hypervigilance to exits, difficulty maintaining eye contact) actually support your claim. However, being coherent and able to answer questions clearly demonstrates you're not completely incapacitated.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Arriving Unprepared
Forgetting documents or medication list weakens your credibility.

**Solution**: Prepare documentation packet the night before. Keep copies of all records.

### Mistake 2: Minimizing Symptoms to "Seem Functional"
Many veterans minimize because they don't want to appear "weak."

**Solution**: Remember, the exam determines disability rating. Honest symptom description leads to appropriate compensation.

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Story
If your current description contradicts previous statements or medical records, credibility suffers.

**Solution**: Review previous statements and medical records before exam. Ensure consistency.

### Mistake 4: No Functional Impact Description
Describing symptoms without explaining how they affect work/life is insufficient.

**Solution**: For each major symptom, explain: "This affects me by [occupational/social impact]"

### Mistake 5: Excessive Emotion or Detachment
Being either extremely emotional or completely emotionless during trauma discussion may seem inconsistent.

**Solution**: Natural emotional response to trauma discussion is appropriate. If you become very emotional, note it: "This is difficult to discuss, but..."

## Post-Exam Timeline

**What Happens Next:**
- Examiner completes report within 2-4 weeks
- VA reviews report with your submitted evidence
- VA makes rating decision (typically within 30-60 days after exam)
- You receive Rating Decision letter explaining rating and effective date
- First payment arrives 30-45 days after approval

**If Denied or Low Rating:**
- You have one year to file Notice of Disagreement
- Consider supplemental claim with additional evidence
- May request higher-level review
- Can appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals

## Rating Scale Context

Understanding what ratings mean helps you gauge expectations:
- 10%: Minimal occupational/social impairment
- 30%: Moderate occupational/social impairment, some difficulty functioning
- 50%: Moderately severe impairment, frequent dysfunction episodes
- 70%: Severe impairment with substantial occupational disability
- 100%: Total occupational disability, unable to work

Your C&P exam testimony about occupational and social impairment directly determines where you fall on this scale.
