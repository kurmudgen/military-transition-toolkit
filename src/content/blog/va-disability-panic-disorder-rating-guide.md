# VA Disability Rating for Panic Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Panic Disorder is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9412** with ratings from **0% to 100%** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. **Panic attack frequency is a key rating factor**—weekly attacks support 30%, more than weekly supports 50%. Many veterans receive **30-50%** for panic disorder. It can be claimed as direct service connection from military stressors or secondary to PTSD, TBI, or other conditions. The key to an accurate rating is documenting the **frequency of attacks** and their **impact on functioning**. Claims typically take 4-6 months.

## What Is Panic Disorder and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Panic Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having more attacks.

**Panic attacks include:**
- Pounding or racing heart
- Sweating
- Trembling or shaking
- Shortness of breath or feeling smothered
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Nausea or stomach distress
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Chills or hot flashes
- Numbness or tingling
- Feelings of unreality or detachment
- Fear of losing control or "going crazy"
- Fear of dying

**Panic Disorder criteria:**
- Recurrent unexpected panic attacks
- At least one attack followed by 1+ month of:
  - Persistent concern about additional attacks
  - Worry about implications (heart attack, going crazy)
  - Significant behavioral changes (avoiding situations)

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Combat stress and trauma
- High-stress operational environments
- Life-threatening situations
- First panic attack during service
- Medical emergencies during service

**Secondary service connection:**
- PTSD (panic attacks as symptom)
- Depression (commonly co-occurs)
- TBI (affects anxiety regulation)
- Chronic pain (stress response)
- Sleep disorders (sleep deprivation worsens anxiety)

## VA Rating Criteria

Panic Disorder is rated under **38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9412** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Diagnosed but minimal impairment |
| **10%** | Mild symptoms during stress OR controlled by medication |
| **30%** | Occasional decrease in work efficiency, panic attacks weekly or less often |
| **50%** | Reduced reliability and productivity, panic attacks more than once a week |
| **70%** | Deficiencies in most areas, near-continuous panic affecting ability to function |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment |

### Key Rating Markers

**Panic attack frequency is specifically mentioned in rating criteria:**
- **Weekly or less** = supports 30%
- **More than once a week** = supports 50%
- **Near-continuous panic** = supports 70%

**Track your panic attacks!** Keep a log with dates, times, duration, symptoms, and triggers.

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing panic symptoms
- Documentation of stressful service events
- Nexus opinion for secondary claims

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Mental health evaluation diagnosing panic disorder
- Treatment records
- Medication records

### Severity Evidence
- **Panic attack log** (critical)
- Treatment frequency
- Functional impairment documentation
- Avoidance behaviors

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will assess:**
1. Panic attack characteristics
2. Frequency of attacks
3. Avoidance behaviors
4. Functional impairment

**Key questions:**
- "How often do you have panic attacks?"
- "What symptoms do you experience?"
- "What situations do you avoid?"
- "How do attacks affect your work and relationships?"

**Be specific about frequency:** "I have panic attacks 3-4 times per week" is much stronger than "I have frequent panic attacks."

## Secondary Conditions to Claim

1. **Agoraphobia** - Fear of places where panic might occur
2. **Depression** - Commonly co-occurs
3. **GERD** - Stress affects digestive system
4. **Sleep Disorders** - Anxiety disrupts sleep
5. **Substance Use** - Self-medication

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I prove panic attack frequency?
Keep a panic attack log with dates, times, symptoms, and duration. This is powerful evidence.

### What if panic attacks started after service?
You can claim secondary to a service-connected condition (PTSD, TBI, etc.) if there's a medical connection.

### Are panic attacks the same as anxiety attacks?
Panic attacks are more intense and sudden. Anxiety attacks build more gradually. Both can be rated under anxiety disorder codes.
