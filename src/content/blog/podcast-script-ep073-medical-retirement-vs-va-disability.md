[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

Here's a scenario that confuses thousands of service members every year: You're going through a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB). The military rates your condition at 40% disabled and medically retires you with $1,800/month in retirement pay. Then the VA rates your exact same conditions at 80% disabled and awards you $2,100/month in VA disability compensation. So you get both checks, right? $3,900/month total? Not exactly. Unless you understand concurrent receipt rules, you might only get $2,100/month—with the VA payment offsetting your military retirement dollar-for-dollar. But if you have 20 years of service and a 50% or higher VA rating, you qualify for CRDP (Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay) and receive BOTH payments in full without offset.

Confused yet? You're not alone. The interaction between military medical retirement and VA disability is one of the most misunderstood topics in veteran benefits—and getting it wrong could cost you thousands of dollars per month.

This is Jacob, your host on the Veteran Transition Blueprint podcast. I'm a Navy E6 going through medical retirement right now, and today we're breaking down military medical retirement versus VA disability. We're covering how the two systems differ, how DoD and VA ratings compare, when you get one payment versus both, the concurrent receipt programs (CRDP and CRSC), and how to maximize your total benefits. By the end of this episode, you'll understand exactly what you're entitled to and how to navigate both systems.

Let's get into it.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Segment 1: Medical Separation vs. Medical Retirement - The Critical 30% Threshold**

Before we dive into VA disability, you need to understand the military's disability system and the difference between medical separation and medical retirement.

**Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) Process:**

If you have a medical condition that may prevent you from performing your duties, you enter the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES):

1. **Medical Evaluation Board (MEB)**: Military doctors evaluate whether your condition meets medical retention standards
2. **Physical Evaluation Board (PEB)**: If the MEB finds you unfit, the PEB determines your disability rating and disposition (separation or retirement)

**Two Possible Outcomes:**

**Outcome 1: Medical Separation (Less Than 30% DoD Rating)**

If the DoD rates your condition(s) at less than 30%:
- You receive a **one-time severance payment**
- You do NOT receive monthly military retirement pay
- You transition to veteran status and can file for VA disability

**Severance Pay Calculation (2025):**
```
Severance Pay = 2 × Monthly Base Pay × Years of Service
```

**Example:**
- E5 with 8 years of service
- Monthly base pay: $3,500
- DoD disability rating: 20%
- **Severance payment: 2 × $3,500 × 8 = $56,000 (one-time lump sum)**

**Important:** If you later receive VA disability compensation, the VA will deduct (recoup) this severance pay from your monthly VA payments until it's paid back—but only if you received the severance on or after specific dates (post-2018 changes allow for disability severance pay without VA recoupment in some cases).

---

**Outcome 2: Medical Retirement (30% or Higher DoD Rating OR 20+ Years of Service)**

If the DoD rates your condition(s) at 30% or higher, OR you have 20+ years of service (regardless of rating), you receive **medical retirement** with monthly retirement pay for life.

**Who Qualifies for Medical Retirement:**
- DoD disability rating of 30% or higher, OR
- 20 or more years of creditable service (regardless of DoD rating)

**Medical Retirement Pay Calculation:**

The military uses TWO formulas and pays whichever is higher:

**Formula 1: Disability-Based**
```
Retirement Pay = DoD Disability Percentage × Monthly Base Pay
```

**Formula 2: Longevity-Based** (if you have 20+ years)
```
Retirement Pay = (Years of Service × 2.5%) × Monthly Base Pay
```

**Example 1: E6 with 12 years, 50% DoD disability rating**
- Monthly base pay: $4,000
- Formula 1 (disability): 50% × $4,000 = $2,000/month
- Formula 2 (longevity): 12 × 2.5% = 30% × $4,000 = $1,200/month
- **Medical retirement pay: $2,000/month (Formula 1 is higher)**

**Example 2: E7 with 22 years, 40% DoD disability rating**
- Monthly base pay: $5,000
- Formula 1 (disability): 40% × $5,000 = $2,000/month
- Formula 2 (longevity): 22 × 2.5% = 55% × $5,000 = $2,750/month
- **Medical retirement pay: $2,750/month (Formula 2 is higher)**

---

**Segment 2: DoD Disability Ratings vs. VA Disability Ratings - Two Different Systems**

Here's where it gets confusing: the DoD and VA use completely different criteria to rate disabilities.

**DoD (Department of Defense) Disability Rating:**

- **Purpose**: Determines if you're FIT or UNFIT for continued military service
- **Criteria**: Only rates conditions that make you UNFIT for your Military Occupational Specialty (MOS)
- **Rating**: Permanent—once assigned, it doesn't change
- **Result**: Determines medical separation or retirement

**Example:** You're a paratrooper with severe knee damage from repeated jumps. DoD rates you 30% disabled because your knee prevents you from jumping and performing your duties.

---

**VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) Disability Rating:**

- **Purpose**: Compensates veterans for ALL service-connected disabilities and their impact on civilian employability and quality of life
- **Criteria**: Rates ALL service-connected conditions, not just those that made you unfit
- **Rating**: Can change over time (increase or decrease based on your condition)
- **Result**: Determines monthly VA disability compensation

**Example (Same paratrooper):** VA rates your knee at 30% AND also rates your chronic back pain (20%), tinnitus (10%), sleep apnea secondary to knee injury (50%), PTSD (50%). Total VA rating using combined ratings math: 80% or higher.

---

**Why the Ratings Differ:**

**DoD asks:** "Can this person continue serving in their military role?"

**VA asks:** "How do this veteran's service-connected conditions affect their ability to function in civilian life?"

**Common Scenario:**
- DoD rating: 30-40% (unfit for military duty)
- VA rating: 60-90% (multiple service-connected conditions affecting daily life)

This is why you can be medically retired by the military with a 30% DoD rating but receive 80% VA disability compensation—completely normal.

---

**Segment 3: The VA Waiver and Offset - Understanding What You Actually Get Paid**

Here's the default rule that frustrates many veterans: **You cannot receive full military retirement pay AND full VA disability compensation simultaneously UNLESS you qualify for concurrent receipt (CRDP or CRSC).**

**The Standard Offset (Without Concurrent Receipt):**

If you're a military retiree receiving VA disability compensation, the VA payment typically offsets your military retirement pay dollar-for-dollar.

**Example (Without Concurrent Receipt):**
- Military retirement pay: $2,000/month
- VA disability compensation: $2,300/month (80% rating)
- You receive: $2,300/month total (NOT $4,300)
- How it works: You "waive" $2,000 of your military retirement to receive $2,300 VA disability (net gain: $300/month)

**Why This Happens:**

Congress historically prohibited "double-dipping" where veterans received both military retirement (for years of service) and VA disability (for service-connected conditions) simultaneously. Veterans had to waive a dollar of retirement pay for each dollar of VA disability received.

**Tax Implications:**
- Military retirement pay: Taxable
- VA disability compensation: Tax-free

Even when offset, switching to VA disability is usually beneficial because VA compensation is tax-free.

---

**Segment 4: Concurrent Receipt Programs - How to Get BOTH Payments Without Offset**

Congress created two programs that allow certain retirees to receive both military retirement and VA disability without offset:

**CRDP: Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay**

**What It Is:** Allows eligible retirees to receive FULL military retirement pay AND full VA disability compensation with no offset.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Regular military retiree with 20+ years of service, OR
- Reserve retiree with 20+ qualifying years who has reached retirement age (typically 60), AND
- VA disability rating of 50% or higher

**How It Works:**
- You receive your full military retirement pay
- You receive your full VA disability compensation
- No offset—both payments in full

**Example with CRDP:**
- Military retirement pay (20 years): $2,500/month
- VA disability compensation (70% rating): $1,848/month
- **Total monthly income: $4,348** (both payments, no offset)

**Application:** CRDP is AUTOMATIC. If you meet the eligibility criteria (20+ years and 50%+ VA rating), DFAS automatically processes CRDP. You don't need to apply.

**Tax Status:** CRDP is taxed the same as regular retirement pay (the retirement portion is taxable, VA portion is tax-free).

**Phase-In Complete:** As of January 1, 2014, all eligible retirees receive full CRDP. The phase-in period ended, so if you qualify, you get 100% of both benefits.

---

**CRSC: Combat-Related Special Compensation**

**What It Is:** Tax-free special compensation for combat-related disabilities.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- 20+ years of service OR medically retired (Chapter 61) with less than 20 years, AND
- VA disability rating of 10% or higher, AND
- At least some portion of your VA rating is for combat-related disabilities

**Combat-Related Disabilities Include:**
- Disabilities caused by combat (gunshot wounds, shrapnel, IED injuries)
- Disabilities from training that simulates combat (live-fire exercises, parachute jumps)
- Disabilities from instrumentalities of war (exposure to chemical agents, hazardous materials used in combat)
- Disabilities from POW experiences or hostile fire

**How It Works:**
- You still have the VA offset on your retirement pay
- CRSC reimburses you (up to the amount of the offset) for your combat-related disabilities
- The CRSC payment is TAX-FREE (unlike CRDP)

**Example with CRSC:**
- Military retirement pay: $2,000/month (taxable)
- VA disability compensation: $2,300/month (80% rating, all combat-related)
- Offset: $2,000
- CRSC reimbursement: $2,000 (tax-free)
- **Effective total: $2,300 VA + $2,000 CRSC = $4,300/month**

**Application:** You MUST apply for CRSC through your military branch. It is NOT automatic like CRDP.

**Key Limitation:** CRSC only reimburses for the portion of your VA rating that is combat-related. If your 80% VA rating includes 50% for combat injuries and 30% for non-combat conditions, CRSC only covers the combat-related portion.

---

**CRDP vs. CRSC: Which One Should You Choose?**

You **cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC simultaneously**—you must choose one.

**Choose CRDP if:**
- You qualify (20+ years, 50%+ VA rating)
- You want automatic enrollment (no application needed)
- You don't care about tax status of the retirement portion

**Choose CRSC if:**
- You have significant combat-related disabilities
- You want tax-free compensation for those disabilities
- The tax savings outweigh any difference in payment amounts
- You're a Chapter 61 retiree with less than 20 years

**Open Season:** You can switch between CRDP and CRSC during an annual open season (check with DFAS for dates).

**How to Decide:**

Compare the after-tax value of each option:
1. Calculate your CRDP amount (full retirement + full VA)
2. Calculate your CRSC amount (retirement + VA + CRSC reimbursement)
3. Factor in taxes (CRSC is tax-free, CRDP retirement portion is taxable)
4. Choose whichever gives you more net income

---

**Segment 5: Chapter 61 Medical Retirement - Special Considerations for Service Members with Less Than 20 Years**

If you're medically retired with less than 20 years of service (Chapter 61 retirement), your situation is different:

**Chapter 61 Retiree Without 20 Years:**
- You receive medical retirement pay based on your DoD rating
- You do NOT automatically qualify for CRDP (requires 20+ years)
- You MAY qualify for CRSC if your disabilities are combat-related

**Example:**
- E5 with 12 years of service
- DoD rating: 50%
- VA rating: 70% (some combat-related)
- Monthly base pay: $3,500
- Medical retirement pay: 50% × $3,500 = $1,750/month
- VA disability: $1,848/month
- Standard offset: You receive $1,848 VA (waive $1,750 retirement)
- With CRSC: You can apply for CRSC to recoup some/all of the offset for combat-related disabilities

**Strategic Move:** Immediately apply for CRSC if you're a Chapter 61 retiree with combat-related conditions. You won't get CRDP without 20 years, but CRSC is available and tax-free.

---

**Segment 6: Strategic Actions - Maximizing Your Benefits Through Both Systems**

**Action 1: File Your VA Claim During the MEB Process**

While you're going through the MEB, you'll be simultaneously evaluated by the VA through the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES).

**Why This Matters:**
- You get your VA rating at the same time as your DoD rating
- VA compensation starts immediately upon retirement (no gap in income)
- You can compare both ratings and understand your total benefit picture

**What to Do:**
- Work with your PEBLO (Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officer) to ensure ALL service-connected conditions are documented
- Attend all VA Compensation & Pension (C&P) exams
- Submit any private medical records that support your claims

---

**Action 2: Claim ALL Service-Connected Conditions with the VA (Not Just What DoD Rated)**

The DoD only rates conditions that make you unfit. The VA rates ALL service-connected conditions.

**Example:**
- DoD rates: Knee condition (40%)
- VA should rate: Knee condition (40%), PLUS back pain (20%), PLUS hip pain (10%), PLUS depression secondary to chronic pain (30%), PLUS sleep apnea (50%)

**Total VA rating could be 80-90%** even though DoD only rated you for one condition at 40%.

**What to Do:**
- List every medical condition that started or worsened during service
- Get buddy statements from fellow service members who witnessed your symptoms
- Provide medical records showing treatment for all conditions

---

**Action 3: Push for a Higher DoD Rating (If You're on the Borderline)**

If your DoD rating is borderline (25-29%), fight to get to 30% to qualify for medical retirement instead of separation.

**Why It Matters:**
- 29% DoD rating = medical separation with one-time severance (no monthly retirement pay)
- 30% DoD rating = medical retirement with monthly retirement pay for life

**What to Do:**
- Request a formal review of your PEB results if you disagree
- Provide additional medical evidence
- Consider hiring a military disability attorney or advocate

---

**Action 4: Understand Your Concurrent Receipt Eligibility Before You Retire**

If you're approaching 20 years of service:
- Know that staying until 20 years qualifies you for CRDP (if your VA rating is 50%+)
- Leaving at 18 or 19 years means you WON'T qualify for CRDP (though CRSC may be available)

**Strategic Decision:** If you're close to 20 years and have significant service-connected disabilities, it may be worth staying until 20 to unlock CRDP eligibility.

---

**Action 5: Apply for CRSC If You Have Combat-Related Disabilities**

CRSC is NOT automatic—you must apply.

**How to Apply:**
- Visit your military branch's CRSC website:
  - Army: https://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/Benefit-Library/Federal-Benefits/Combat-Related-Special-Compensation-(CRSC)
  - Air Force: https://www.afpc.af.mil/Combat-Related-Special-Compensation/
  - Navy: https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-Sailor/Wounded-Ill-And-Injured/CRSC/
  - Marine Corps: https://www.manpower.usmc.mil/
- Complete the application and provide documentation linking your disabilities to combat
- Wait for decision (typically 45-90 days)

---

**Segment 7: Real-World Scenarios - What You'll Actually Receive**

Let's walk through real scenarios so you understand what you'll actually get paid:

**Scenario 1: E6 with 18 Years, 40% DoD Rating, 70% VA Rating (No CRDP Eligibility)**
- Monthly base pay: $4,500
- Medical retirement pay (disability formula): 40% × $4,500 = $1,800/month
- VA disability compensation (70%): $1,848/month
- **Without CRDP or CRSC:** You receive $1,848 VA (waive $1,800 retirement) = **$1,848/month**
- **With CRSC (if combat-related):** You receive $1,848 VA + up to $1,800 CRSC reimbursement = **up to $3,648/month**

---

**Scenario 2: E7 with 22 Years, 30% DoD Rating, 60% VA Rating (CRDP Eligible)**
- Monthly base pay: $5,500
- Military retirement pay (longevity formula): 22 × 2.5% = 55% × $5,500 = $3,025/month
- VA disability compensation (60%): $1,517/month
- **Without CRDP:** You receive $3,025 retirement (since retirement is higher than VA) = **$3,025/month**
- **With CRDP:** You receive $3,025 retirement + $1,517 VA = **$4,542/month**

---

**Scenario 3: O3 with 20 Years, 50% DoD Rating, 100% VA Rating (CRDP Eligible)**
- Monthly base pay: $8,000
- Military retirement pay (both formulas):
  - Disability: 50% × $8,000 = $4,000
  - Longevity: 20 × 2.5% = 50% × $8,000 = $4,000
- Military retirement: $4,000/month
- VA disability compensation (100%): $3,831/month
- **With CRDP:** You receive $4,000 retirement + $3,831 VA = **$7,831/month**
- **Annual income: $93,972**

---

[CONCLUSION]

Let's bring this home. Military medical retirement and VA disability are two separate systems with different purposes, different rating criteria, and different payment structures. The DoD rates your fitness for military duty; the VA rates your overall disability and its impact on civilian life. By default, you can't receive both military retirement and VA disability without offset—but if you qualify for CRDP (20+ years and 50%+ VA rating) or CRSC (combat-related disabilities), you can receive both payments without offset.

If you're going through the MEB process right now:
1. Claim ALL your service-connected conditions with the VA, not just what the DoD rates
2. Fight for a 30% or higher DoD rating if you're on the borderline (unlocks medical retirement instead of separation)
3. Understand whether you qualify for CRDP or CRSC and apply if needed
4. Work with your PEBLO to ensure a smooth IDES process

If you're already medically retired:
1. Check if you qualify for CRDP or CRSC and aren't currently receiving it
2. File for increases with the VA if your conditions have worsened
3. Consider switching between CRDP and CRSC during open season if one is more financially beneficial

The difference between understanding these systems and not understanding them can be thousands of dollars per month—tens or hundreds of thousands over your lifetime. Don't leave money on the table.

Resources for this episode, including CRDP and CRSC fact sheets, PEB resources, and medical retirement calculators, are available at militarytransitiontoolkit.com. Next episode, we're covering how to use VA healthcare effectively—enrollment, copays, and community care.

Until next time—this is Jacob. Understand your benefits. Maximize your payments.

**Description:**

Medical retirement and VA disability—two separate systems that confuse thousands of veterans every year. Can you get both? How do DoD and VA ratings differ? What's the difference between CRDP and CRSC? Join Jacob for a complete breakdown of military medical retirement vs. VA disability, including the critical 30% threshold for retirement vs. separation, how DoD and VA ratings compare, the VA waiver and offset rules, concurrent receipt programs (CRDP and CRSC), and strategies to maximize your benefits. Learn how to navigate both systems and avoid leaving thousands of dollars per month on the table.

**Key Points:**

- Medical separation (DoD rating <30%) = one-time severance pay, NO monthly retirement; Medical retirement (≥30% OR 20+ years) = monthly retirement pay for life
- DoD ratings are permanent and based on fitness for military duty; VA ratings can change over time and rate ALL service-connected conditions
- Common scenario: 30-40% DoD rating for one condition BUT 70-90% VA rating for multiple service-connected conditions
- Standard offset rule: Cannot receive both military retirement and VA disability without offset UNLESS you qualify for CRDP or CRSC
- CRDP (Concurrent Retirement Disability Pay): For 20+ year retirees with 50%+ VA rating = FULL retirement + FULL VA disability with no offset (AUTOMATIC, no application needed)
- CRSC (Combat-Related Special Compensation): For combat-related disabilities, TAX-FREE, available to Chapter 61 retirees with <20 years (MUST apply)
- Cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC simultaneously—must choose whichever is financially better
- Medical retirement pay calculation: Higher of (DoD disability % × base pay) OR (years × 2.5% × base pay)
- Real-world examples: E7 with 22 years and 60% VA rating gets $3,025 retirement + $1,517 VA = $4,542/month with CRDP (vs. only $3,025 without CRDP)
- O3 with 20 years, 100% VA rating gets $4,000 retirement + $3,831 VA = $7,831/month ($93,972/year) with CRDP
- Strategic actions: Claim ALL conditions with VA (not just what DoD rated), fight for 30%+ DoD rating to get retirement vs. separation, stay until 20 years if close (unlocks CRDP), apply for CRSC if combat-related
- CRSC application required through your military branch—not automatic
