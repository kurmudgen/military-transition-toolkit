## Common Mistakes

**1. Not Getting CompTIA Trifecta:** A+, Network+, Security+ are foundational. Get them via COOL for free. They open doors and add salary premium.

**2. Accepting Low-Ball Offers:** Help desk starts lower but don't accept $15/hour. With experience and clearance, target $45K minimum, $55K+ preferred.

**3. Staying in Help Desk Forever:** Help desk is entry point, not career. Plan progression: Help Desk (1-2 years) → Desktop Support (2-3 years) → Systems Admin or Specialist role. Get certifications, keep learning.

**4. Poor Customer Service Examples:** IT support is technical + customer service. Prepare stories showing you handled difficult users professionally. Customer service skills differentiate you.

**5. Not Building Technical Depth:** Don't just reset passwords. Learn Active Directory, networking, security. Build toward higher-level roles. Help desk alone caps at $60K-$70K.
