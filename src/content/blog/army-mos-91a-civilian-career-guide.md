## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest about civilian skills you don't have:

**Customer service and communication:** Working at a dealership means explaining repairs to customers who don't understand mechanical systems. You'll need to translate technical issues into plain English and provide cost estimates—very different from military maintenance.

**Computer-based diagnostic systems:** Civilian equipment uses manufacturer-specific diagnostic software (CAT ET, Komatsu KOMTRAX, etc.). You'll need to learn these systems—they're more advanced than military diagnostic tools but based on similar principles.

**Flat-rate or billable hours:** Some shops pay on flat-rate (you get paid based on job completion, not hours worked). This rewards efficiency but creates pressure. Understand the pay structure before accepting positions.

**Business operations:** If you go independent (mobile mechanic, small shop), you need to understand invoicing, insurance, tax withholding, and business licensing. Take small business courses or partner with someone who handles admin.

**Civilian workplace culture:** Military directness doesn't always work in civilian shops. You may encounter less motivated coworkers, different safety standards, and less structured environments. Adapt your communication style and lead by example.
