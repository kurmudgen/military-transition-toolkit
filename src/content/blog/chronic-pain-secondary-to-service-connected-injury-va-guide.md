# Chronic Pain Secondary to Service-Connected Injury: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** COMPLICATED - Read carefully
- **Key Issue:** Chronic pain must be a distinct condition, not just a symptom
- **When It Works:** If you have chronic pain syndrome/fibromyalgia as separate diagnosis
- **Alternative Strategy:** Ensure primary condition is rated appropriately for pain
- **Average rating if distinct diagnosis:** 10-40%
- **Success rate:** Variable depending on approach

**Important:** This is a nuanced claim because pain is often considered part of the original injury's rating. Understanding when chronic pain warrants a separate claim is crucial.

## Understanding the Challenge

### Pain as a Symptom vs. Condition

**Pain as Symptom (Already Rated):**
- Most musculoskeletal ratings include pain
- The VA rating criteria say "with pain" throughout
- Filing for "pain" separately is usually denied

**Pain as Separate Condition (Can Be Rated):**
- Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS)
- Fibromyalgia
- Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)
- Central sensitization syndrome

### When Can You Claim Separately?

**You CAN claim if:**
- You have a diagnosed chronic pain syndrome
- Pain has spread beyond the original injury site
- You have systemic pain symptoms
- A distinct chronic pain condition develops

**You CANNOT typically claim:**
- Pain at the injury site (already rated)
- Pain as a standalone symptom
- "Chronic pain" without specific diagnosis

## Types of Chronic Pain Conditions

### Fibromyalgia

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Widespread pain for 3+ months
- Pain on both sides of body
- Pain above and below waist
- Tender points (older criteria) or widespread pain index
- Fatigue, cognitive issues, sleep disturbance

**Can Be Secondary To:**
- Any chronic injury causing prolonged pain
- PTSD/mental health conditions
- Traumatic brain injury
- Sleep disorders

### Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)

**Characteristics:**
- Severe burning pain
- Usually in extremity
- Changes in skin color/temperature
- Swelling, sweating changes
- Spreads beyond original injury

**Often Secondary To:**
- Fractures
- Sprains/strains
- Surgery complications
- Nerve injuries

### Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS)

**Defined By:**
- Pain lasting beyond normal healing time
- Pain out of proportion to tissue damage
- Psychological component
- Functional impairment

## VA Rating Criteria

### Fibromyalgia (DC 5025)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Requires continuous medication for control |
| 20% | Episodic, with exacerbations precipitated by stress or overexertion but symptoms controlled by medication |
| 40% | Constant or nearly constant, refractory to therapy |

### CRPS/Other Pain Conditions

Rated analogously, often under:
- Neuralgia codes (DC 8710-8730)
- Musculoskeletal codes
- Or by analogy to fibromyalgia

## How Injuries Cause Chronic Pain Conditions

### Central Sensitization

**Mechanism:**
- Prolonged pain signals "wind up" nervous system
- Spinal cord neurons become hypersensitive
- Brain pain processing changes
- Normal stimuli become painful

**Documented In:**
- Long-standing musculoskeletal injuries
- Repeated trauma
- Post-surgical conditions
- Nerve injuries

### Spread of Pain

**Pattern:**
- Starts at injury site
- Spreads to adjacent areas
- May become widespread
- Original injury "triggers" systemic syndrome

## Evidence You Need

### For Chronic Pain Syndrome Secondary Claim

**Required:**
- Original service-connected injury documented
- Specific chronic pain diagnosis (CPS, fibromyalgia, CRPS)
- Documentation of pain spreading/changing character
- Treatment records
- Nexus letter explaining how injury led to chronic pain syndrome

### Medical Records Needed

**From Original Injury:**
- Service connection documentation
- Treatment history
- Pain progression notes

**For Chronic Pain Condition:**
- Pain specialist or rheumatologist evaluation
- Formal diagnosis meeting criteria
- Documentation distinguishing from original injury
- Functional impact assessment

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Must Address:**
- How original injury led to chronic pain syndrome
- Why this is distinct from the injury's expected pain
- Medical mechanisms (central sensitization, etc.)
- Literature supporting progression

**Example Language:**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for [lumbar degenerative disc disease] at [X]%. [Veteran] has developed chronic pain syndrome/fibromyalgia as a result of this service-connected condition.*

*Chronic Pain Syndrome is distinct from the pain expected with lumbar disc disease for the following reasons: (1) pain has spread to involve areas beyond the lumbar spine including [areas], (2) pain characteristics include allodynia and hyperalgesia consistent with central sensitization, and (3) associated symptoms include fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive difficulties characteristic of fibromyalgia.*

*It is my opinion that prolonged nociceptive input from the service-connected lumbar condition has resulted in central sensitization and development of fibromyalgia syndrome. This represents a distinct pathological entity that has developed secondary to, but exists independently from, the original spinal condition."*

## Alternative Strategies

### Strategy 1: Higher Rating for Primary Condition

If pain is severe, ensure your primary condition is rated appropriately:
- Request increase for original injury
- Document all pain impacts
- This avoids the "separate condition" challenge

### Strategy 2: Functional Loss Approach

Document how pain causes functional loss:
- Limited motion
- Difficulty with daily activities
- Impacts on employment

### Strategy 3: Fibromyalgia Secondary to Mental Health

If you have PTSD/depression:
- Fibromyalgia secondary to PTSD has strong research support
- May be easier pathway than injury → fibromyalgia

### Strategy 4: Document Everything

Even without separate chronic pain rating:
- Document pain in treatment records
- Support TDIU claims
- Supports future claims

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Evaluate Your Situation

Determine if you have:
- Diagnosed chronic pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, or CRPS
- Pain spreading beyond original injury
- Systemic symptoms (fatigue, sleep issues, cognitive problems)

### Step 2: Get Proper Diagnosis

See appropriate specialist:
- Rheumatologist (fibromyalgia)
- Pain specialist (CPS, CRPS)
- Neurologist (neuropathic pain)

### Step 3: Establish Connection

Document:
- Timeline from original injury to chronic pain syndrome
- How injury led to this development
- Distinguishing features

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get specialist opinion:
- Must explain why this is separate from original injury
- Must cite medical mechanisms
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Secondary Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Clear explanation of distinct condition
- Upload all evidence

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Claiming "pain" without diagnosis** - Will be denied as symptom

2. **Not distinguishing from original injury** - VA will say already rated

3. **No specialist evaluation** - Need formal chronic pain condition diagnosis

4. **Weak nexus** - Must explain mechanism of secondary development

5. **Ignoring easier alternatives** - Consider higher rating for primary instead

6. **Missing fibromyalgia diagnosis** - Often undiagnosed in veterans

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: CRPS Secondary to Ankle Fracture

**Background:** 40-year-old veteran, 10% ankle fracture residuals
- Developed severe burning pain, color changes in foot
- Pain specialist diagnosed CRPS Type I
- Pain now extends up leg

**Evidence:**
- CRPS diagnosis from pain specialist
- Documentation of spreading symptoms
- Nexus explaining injury → CRPS development

**Outcome:** 40% for CRPS (rated by analogy)
**Combined Rating:** 10% → 50%

### Case Study 2: Fibromyalgia Secondary to Back Injury

**Background:** 52-year-old veteran, 40% lumbar DDD
- Widespread pain developed over 10 years
- Chronic fatigue, sleep disturbance
- Rheumatologist diagnosed fibromyalgia

**Evidence:**
- Fibromyalgia meeting diagnostic criteria
- Documentation of widespread pain beyond back
- Strong nexus citing central sensitization

**Outcome:** 40% for fibromyalgia
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 64% (rounds to 60%)

### Case Study 3: Denial - Pain Without Distinct Diagnosis

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, 20% knee condition
- Claims "chronic pain" secondary to knee
- No distinct pain syndrome diagnosed
- Pain is at knee only

**Outcome:** Denied - "Pain contemplated in knee rating"
**Lesson:** Need distinct chronic pain diagnosis, not just pain

## When NOT to File This Claim

**Don't file if:**
- You only have pain at the injury site
- You don't have a distinct chronic pain diagnosis
- Your pain is typical for your injury
- You haven't been evaluated by pain/rheumatology specialist

**Instead:**
- Ensure original condition is rated appropriately
- Request increase if pain is worse
- Document for TDIU if unable to work

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Pain contemplated in [condition] rating"** - Most common
2. **"No diagnosed chronic pain condition"**
3. **"Insufficient nexus"**

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add chronic pain condition diagnosis (fibromyalgia, CRPS, etc.)
- Add specialist nexus
- Document distinct features from original injury

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I just claim chronic pain?**
A: No. You need a diagnosed chronic pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, or CRPS.

**Q: If my back hurts, isn't that already rated?**
A: Yes, pain at the injury site is included in the injury rating.

**Q: What's the difference between injury pain and chronic pain syndrome?**
A: Chronic pain syndrome involves widespread pain, central sensitization, and symptoms beyond just pain at the injury site.

**Q: Who diagnoses chronic pain syndrome?**
A: Pain specialists, rheumatologists, or neurologists.

**Q: Is fibromyalgia related to my injuries?**
A: Possibly. Prolonged pain from any injury can trigger fibromyalgia in susceptible individuals.

**Q: What if pain spread from my injury to other areas?**
A: This spreading pattern supports a chronic pain syndrome diagnosis. Get evaluated.

**Q: Is this claim worth pursuing?**
A: Only with a distinct diagnosis. Otherwise, focus on rating your primary condition appropriately.
