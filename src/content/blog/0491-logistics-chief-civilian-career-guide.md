## Bottom Line Up Front

As a Marine Corps 0491 Logistics/Mobility Chief (GySgt-MGySgt), you've coordinated enterprise-level logistics operations supporting MAGTF deployments, served on general officer staffs, interfaced with USTRANSCOM and service component commands, and executed strategic mobility planning. You've supervised multiple logistics functions—supply, maintenance, transportation, services—and managed complex operations at the MEF, MARFOR, and HQMC levels. That senior leadership experience translates directly into **logistics operations management, supply chain management, distribution center management, operations director, and senior program management**—all executive-track positions in civilian logistics. With 10-20 years of military logistics leadership, realistic salaries range from **$90,000-$130,000** for management roles, with senior positions hitting **$140,000-$180,000+** in supply chain director, operations director, or senior defense contractor leadership positions. You'll need a bachelor's degree and industry certifications, but your strategic logistics leadership is exactly what companies need at the director and VP level.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 0491 researching civilian careers faces a unique challenge: **You're overqualified for entry-level roles but lack civilian credentials for senior positions.**

You've got 10-20 years of experience managing multi-million dollar logistics operations, leading teams of 50-200+ personnel, coordinating strategic deployments, and advising general officers. That's director-level responsibility.

But civilian HR sees: "No bachelor's degree," "No civilian logistics management experience," "Military logistics doesn't translate."

That's complete garbage—but it's a reality you need to navigate strategically.

Here's what civilian companies don't understand about what you actually did as a 0491:

You didn't just "do military logistics." You:
- Coordinated all combat logistics functions (supply, maintenance, transportation, services) for MAGTF-level operations
- Planned and executed strategic deployments of thousands of personnel and millions of pounds of equipment
- Managed multi-million dollar logistics operations and budgets
- Served as principal logistics advisor to commanders at the MEF, MARFOR, or HQMC level
- Interfaced with Joint and Service component commands (USTRANSCOM, SDDC, MSC, AMC) on strategic mobility requirements
- Led teams of 50-200+ logistics professionals across multiple functional areas
- Analyzed logistics operations, identified inefficiencies, and implemented process improvements
- Coordinated with civilian agencies, contractors, and host nation partners
- Managed logistics systems, databases, and automated information systems
- Briefed senior leaders (O-6 through flag officers) on complex logistics operations

That's **strategic operations management, supply chain leadership, multi-function coordination, enterprise logistics, program management, and executive advisory**. Every major company with complex supply chains needs exactly that leadership—you just need to bridge the civilian credential gap and translate your experience into language they understand.

## Best civilian career paths for 0491

As a senior enlisted logistics leader, you're targeting management and director-level positions, not coordinator roles. Here are the fields where 0491s successfully transition.

### Logistics Operations Manager / Logistics Manager

**Civilian job titles:**
- Logistics Operations Manager
- Logistics Manager
- Transportation and Logistics Manager
- Distribution Operations Manager
- Supply Chain Operations Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Logistics Manager:** $85,000-$115,000
- **Logistics Operations Manager:** $95,000-$130,000
- **Senior Logistics Manager:** $120,000-$150,000
- **Regional Logistics Manager:** $130,000-$165,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Managing multi-function logistics operations
- Leading teams of logistics professionals
- Coordinating transportation, warehousing, and distribution
- Budget management and cost control
- Process improvement and efficiency initiatives
- Cross-functional coordination with operations, finance, and sales
- Strategic planning and execution

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree in Supply Chain, Logistics, Business, or related field** (REQUIRED for most positions—use your GI Bill immediately if you don't have one)
- **CPIM (Certified in Production and Inventory Management)** – APICS/ASCM. Median salary: $104,000. Cost: $1,000-$2,000.
- **CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional)** – APICS/ASCM. Salary boost: 18-25%. Cost: $1,200-$2,500.
- **10+ years of logistics management experience** (you have it)

**Reality check:**
This is the most direct transition for 0491s. Logistics managers oversee the entire logistics function for a company, division, or region—coordinating transportation, warehousing, inventory, and distribution operations.

You'll manage teams of 15-50 logistics professionals (coordinators, supervisors, specialists), oversee budgets of $5M-$50M+, coordinate with internal stakeholders and external partners, and report to directors or VPs.

The challenge: Most positions require a bachelor's degree. If you don't have one, that's your first priority. Use your GI Bill. Many online programs (Arizona State, Penn State, Colorado State) offer accelerated bachelor's completion programs for veterans—you can finish in 12-18 months with your military logistics training counting as credits.

With a degree and CPIM/CSCP certifications, your 10-20 years of military logistics leadership makes you highly competitive for $95K-$130K positions. Within 3-5 years of civilian experience, you can move into senior manager or director roles ($130K-$165K+).

Major employers include manufacturers, retailers (Walmart, Target, Amazon), 3PLs (XPO, C.H. Robinson, DHL), transportation companies, and distribution-heavy industries.

**Best for:** 0491s who want direct application of their logistics leadership, are willing to invest in a bachelor's degree if needed, and want management-track positions with clear advancement to director level.

### Supply Chain Manager / Supply Chain Director

**Civilian job titles:**
- Supply Chain Manager
- Supply Chain Operations Manager
- Supply Chain Director
- Director of Logistics and Supply Chain
- VP of Supply Chain Operations

**Salary ranges:**
- **Supply Chain Manager:** $89,000-$125,000
- **Senior Supply Chain Manager:** $115,000-$145,000
- **Supply Chain Director:** $145,000-$184,000
- **VP of Supply Chain:** $175,000-$250,000+

**What translates directly:**
- End-to-end supply chain coordination
- Strategic planning and execution
- Multi-stakeholder coordination (suppliers, transportation, warehousing, customers)
- Process optimization and efficiency
- Budget and financial management
- Team leadership and development
- Technology and systems implementation

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (REQUIRED; Master's in Supply Chain or MBA increasingly preferred for director level)
- **CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional)** – APICS/ASCM. Essential credential. Cost: $1,200-$2,500.
- **CPIM** – Complementary certification. Cost: $1,000-$2,000.
- **SCPro** – CSCMP certification, tiered program. Particularly valuable for senior roles. Cost: varies by level.
- **15+ years of experience** (you have it)

**Reality check:**
Supply chain managers and directors own the entire supply chain—from supplier management through production planning, inventory management, logistics, and distribution. It's broader than pure logistics and more strategic.

Your 0491 experience coordinating across all logistics functions (supply, maintenance, transportation, services) and interfacing with external commands (TRANSCOM, SDDC, MSC, AMC) is directly applicable. You've operated at enterprise and strategic levels—exactly what supply chain directors do.

The barrier: Most companies require a bachelor's degree for supply chain manager roles, and many prefer a master's (MBA or MS in Supply Chain) for director positions. If you don't have a bachelor's, that's Priority #1. Once you have it, consider pursuing a master's part-time while working (many employers offer tuition assistance).

With a bachelor's, CSCP certification, and your military experience, you can land supply chain manager roles ($89K-$125K). With proven performance, you can advance to senior manager ($115K-$145K) within 3-5 years and director ($145K-$184K) within 7-10 years. MBA or master's accelerates this timeline.

Industries hiring: Manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, electronics, consumer goods), retail, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, technology.

**Best for:** 0491s who want to move into strategic supply chain leadership at the director/executive level, are willing to invest in education (bachelor's + potentially master's), and have strong business acumen.

### Distribution Center Manager / Operations Manager

**Civilian job titles:**
- Distribution Center Manager
- Warehouse Operations Manager
- Fulfillment Center Manager
- Operations Manager
- Multi-Site Operations Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Distribution Center Manager:** $85,000-$113,000
- **Senior DC Manager (large facility):** $110,000-$140,000
- **Multi-Site Operations Manager:** $130,000-$160,000
- **Regional Operations Director:** $150,000-$185,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Managing large-scale operations with 100-500+ personnel
- Budget responsibility ($10M-$100M+ operations)
- Safety, quality, and productivity management
- Team leadership and development
- Process improvement and operational excellence
- Technology implementation and systems management
- Cross-functional coordination

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required for most DC manager roles)
- **CPIM or CSCP** – Valuable for advancement beyond single-site management
- **Lean Six Sigma Green Belt or Black Belt** – Process improvement credentials increasingly expected
- **10+ years of operations/leadership experience** (you have it)

**Reality check:**
Distribution center managers run large facilities—think Amazon fulfillment centers, Walmart distribution centers, 3PL warehouses. You're responsible for safety, productivity, quality, budget, staffing, and operational metrics for facilities processing millions in inventory monthly.

Your 0491 experience managing complex operations, leading large teams, and coordinating across multiple functions translates well. The work is more tactical than supply chain director roles but still senior leadership.

Entry-level DC manager positions (smaller facilities, 50-100 employees) pay $85K-$100K. Large facilities (200-500+ employees) pay $110K-$140K. Multi-site managers overseeing 3-5 distribution centers earn $130K-$160K. Regional directors overseeing 10-20 sites earn $150K-$185K+.

The career path is clear: DC Manager → Senior DC Manager → Multi-Site Manager → Regional Director → VP of Operations.

Major employers: Amazon, Walmart, Target, FedEx, UPS, 3PL companies (XPO, DHL Supply Chain), manufacturers with large distribution networks.

**Best for:** 0491s who excel at tactical operations management, enjoy fast-paced environments, and want clear advancement to regional and VP-level operations roles.

### Senior Logistics Analyst / Logistics Program Manager

**Civilian job titles:**
- Senior Logistics Analyst
- Logistics Program Manager
- Supply Chain Program Manager
- Operations Improvement Manager
- Strategic Logistics Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Senior Logistics Analyst:** $93,000-$123,000
- **Logistics Program Manager:** $100,000-$135,000
- **Senior Program Manager:** $125,000-$160,000
- **Principal Program Manager:** $150,000-$185,000+

**What translates directly:**

- Process improvement initiatives
- Data analysis and decision support
- Stakeholder management
- Budget and resource management

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required)

- **CPIM or CSCP** – Supply chain credentials
- **Master's degree or MBA** (preferred for senior program management)

**Reality check:**
Program manager and senior analyst roles are strategic positions supporting supply chain and logistics operations. You'll lead improvement initiatives, manage complex projects, analyze operations, and drive change across the organization.

These roles suit 0491s who prefer strategic planning and analysis over day-to-day operational management. You'll work with directors and VPs, lead cross-functional teams, and manage projects ranging from warehouse network optimization to technology implementations to process redesigns.

Aerospace, defense, technology, consulting firms, and large manufacturers hire for these roles. Pay is strong ($93K-$160K+), and the work is intellectually challenging.

The PMP certification is essential—it's the industry standard for program management. Combined with your military logistics experience, it opens doors to program management roles across industries.

**Best for:** 0491s who are analytically minded, prefer strategic planning over operational execution, and want project/program management careers.

### Defense Contractor (Senior Logistics Management)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Senior Logistics Manager (contractor)
- Program Manager – Logistics
- Operations Manager – Defense Programs
- Strategic Mobility Manager
- Logistics Director (contractor)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Senior Logistics Manager (CONUS):** $110,000-$145,000
- **Program Manager – Logistics:** $130,000-$165,000
- **Operations Manager (OCONUS):** $140,000-$180,000+
- **Logistics Director:** $160,000-$200,000+

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're supporting military logistics in a senior civilian capacity.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Secret or Top Secret clearance** (you have it—maintain it!)
- **Bachelor's degree** (required by most major contractors)
- **DAWIA certifications** (LOG-2 or LOG-3 for DoD program management positions)
- **PMP** (program management positions)
- **CPIM/CSCP** (valuable but not always required)

**Reality check:**
Defense contracting is the most natural fit for 0491s. Your military logistics experience, clearance, and understanding of DoD operations make you highly competitive for senior contractor positions.

Major contractors (Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, L3Harris, KBR, Amentum, DynCorp, PAE, and hundreds of mid-size firms) support military logistics operations worldwide—from installation logistics support to strategic mobility to expeditionary logistics.

Your 0491 background positions you for senior manager and program manager roles, not entry-level. With 10-20 years of military logistics leadership and an active clearance, you can land positions paying $110K-$165K+ depending on location, clearance level, and program complexity.

OCONUS positions (Kuwait, Qatar, Djibouti, Afghanistan historically) pay premium rates ($140K-$200K+) due to hardship, danger pay, and operational tempo. CONUS positions at major installations or program offices pay $110K-$145K.

Senior roles managing large programs or serving as logistics directors on major contracts pay $160K-$200K+.

Work can involve irregular hours, supporting high-tempo operations, and potential deployments. But compensation is strong, you're working with people who understand military culture, and you continue supporting the mission.

**Best for:** 0491s with active clearances who want to continue supporting military operations, are willing to work OCONUS if needed, and want top-tier compensation.

### Federal Government (Senior Logistics Management)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Logistics Management Specialist (GS-346)
- Transportation Assistant (GS-2102)
- Program Manager – Logistics
- Supervisory Logistics Management Specialist
- Division Chief – Logistics

**Salary ranges:**
- **GS-12 (mid-level specialist):** $75,000-$98,000
- **GS-13 (senior specialist):** $89,000-$116,000
- **GS-14 (supervisory/program manager):** $105,000-$137,000
- **GS-15 (division chief/senior manager):** $124,000-$161,000
- **SES (Senior Executive Service):** $135,000-$200,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Logistics operations planning and execution
- Program management and coordination
- Budget and resource management
- Policy development and implementation
- Multi-agency coordination
- Team leadership and supervision

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required for GS-12+)
- **DAWIA certifications** (if DoD civilian—LOG-2 or LOG-3 for senior positions)
- **Master's degree** (preferred for GS-14/15 and SES)
- **Veteran preference** (5 or 10 points—significant advantage)

**Reality check:**
Federal civilian positions offer job security, defined pay progression, excellent benefits, pension, and work-life balance. For senior 0491s, you're targeting GS-13 through GS-15 (or SES) positions, not entry-level.

Your military logistics leadership experience can qualify you for direct hire at GS-12 or GS-13 with a bachelor's degree. Veteran preference (5 or 10 points) gives you significant hiring advantage over civilian applicants.

Federal agencies hiring senior logistics professionals:
- **DoD** – Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines (SDDC, DLA, installation logistics, program offices)
- **DHS** – Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, FEMA
- **VA** – Veterans Health Administration logistics
- **GSA** – General Services Administration
- **DOT** – Department of Transportation

Career progression: GS-12 → GS-13 (1-2 years) → GS-14 (2-3 years) → GS-15 (3-5 years) → SES (competitive). You can reach GS-14 ($105K-$137K) within 4-6 years and GS-15 ($124K-$161K) within 8-10 years.

Pay is lower than defense contracting or private sector director roles, but job security, pension, work-life balance, and mission focus are significant benefits.

**Best for:** 0491s who want federal job security, pension, work-life balance, and mission-focused work over maximum compensation.

### Operations Director / VP of Operations

**Civilian job titles:**
- Operations Director
- Director of Logistics Operations
- VP of Operations
- Chief Operations Officer (COO)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Operations Director:** $137,000-$184,000
- **VP of Operations:** $175,000-$250,000+
- **SVP of Operations:** $225,000-$350,000+
- **COO:** $300,000-$500,000+ (plus equity in many cases)

**What translates directly:**
- Enterprise-level operations management
- Strategic planning and execution
- P&L (profit and loss) responsibility
- Executive leadership and team building
- Cross-functional coordination (operations, finance, sales, HR)
- Process transformation and change management
- Board and investor relations (senior roles)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required)
- **Master's degree (MBA or MS in Supply Chain)** (strongly preferred/required for most director and VP roles)
- **Executive leadership programs** (e.g., Harvard Business School Executive Education)
- **15-25 years of progressive operations leadership** (you have it)

**Reality check:**
Director and VP-level roles are the pinnacle of operations leadership—you're responsible for the entire operations function including logistics, supply chain, manufacturing, quality, and facilities.

These positions are not entry-level for transitioning military—you'll typically need to prove yourself in civilian logistics/operations management roles first. The typical path: Logistics Manager (3-5 years civilian) → Senior Logistics Manager or DC Manager (3-5 years) → Operations Director (5-8 years) → VP of Operations.

However, some 0491s with bachelor's or master's degrees, strong certifications (CSCP, PMP), and proven track records land senior manager or director roles within 2-3 years of transition. Your military leadership experience counts, but you need to demonstrate business results in civilian environments.

Salaries at director and VP levels are significant ($175K-$250K+ for VP roles), often including bonuses, stock options, and comprehensive executive benefits packages.

**Best for:** Highly ambitious 0491s with bachelor's degrees (or willing to earn one), interested in pursuing master's degrees (MBA), and committed to long-term executive leadership careers in operations.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "0491 Logistics/Mobility Chief" on your resume. Civilians don't understand it. Here's how to translate your senior leadership:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Coordinated logistics operations for MAGTF deployments | Led enterprise logistics operations supporting 5,000+ personnel deployments; managed $50M+ supply chain operations |
| Served as logistics advisor to MEF/MARFOR commanders | Principal logistics advisor to executive leadership; provided strategic guidance on supply chain operations and risk mitigation |
| Managed unit logistics operations and budget | Managed annual logistics operations budget of $15M+; achieved 98% execution rate while reducing costs 12% |

| Implemented process improvements in logistics operations | Led operational excellence initiatives reducing order processing time 30% and improving inventory accuracy to 99.5% |
| Briefed senior leaders on logistics status and capabilities | Presented complex logistics analyses and recommendations to executive leadership influencing strategic decisions |

Use **executive language**: Led, Directed, Managed, Executed, Advised, Interfaced, Implemented, Achieved.

Use **business metrics**: "Managed $15M budget," "Led team of 75 professionals," "Reduced costs 15%," "Improved throughput 25%," "Achieved 99% on-time delivery."

Focus on **strategic impact**: Don't list tactical tasks. Emphasize strategic planning, executive advisory, enterprise operations, and business results.

## Certifications that actually matter (for senior roles)

As a senior professional targeting management and director positions, you need executive-level credentials:

### Critical (get these immediately):

**Bachelor's degree in Supply Chain, Logistics, Business, or related field** - NON-NEGOTIABLE for management roles. If you don't have one, this is Priority #1. Use your GI Bill. Fastest options: Arizona State University Online, Penn State World Campus, Colorado State University Global—all offer accelerated programs for veterans. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 12-24 months for completion degree. Value: Required for 90%+ of management positions.

**CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional)** - APICS/ASCM certification. Industry gold standard for supply chain professionals. Shows comprehensive knowledge of end-to-end supply chain. Cost: $1,200-$2,500. Study time: 3-6 months. Value: 18-25% salary increase; essential for senior supply chain roles.

**CPIM (Certified in Production and Inventory Management)** - APICS/ASCM certification. Complementary to CSCP. Cost: $1,000-$2,000. Value: Median salary $104,000; valuable for logistics management roles.

### High priority (get these within 1-2 years):

**Master's degree (MBA or MS in Supply Chain Management)** - Increasingly required for director-level positions. Many 0491s earn master's while working (part-time, online). Cost: $10K-$40K (some GI Bill benefits may remain; employer tuition assistance). Time: 18-36 months part-time. Value: Required/strongly preferred for director and VP roles ($140K-$200K+ positions).

**PMP (Project Management Professional)** - PMI certification. Essential for program management roles. Cost: $500-$3,000. Prerequisites: 3 years PM experience (you have it). Value: Standard credential for program managers; required by many defense contractors.

**SCPro Certification** - CSCMP (Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals) tiered certification program. Levels 1-3 demonstrate increasing supply chain mastery. Cost: varies by level. Value: Recognized credential for supply chain professionals; good alternative/complement to CSCP.

### Medium priority (if it fits your path):

**Lean Six Sigma Black Belt** - Process improvement and operational excellence credential. Cost: $1,500-$4,000. Value: Essential for operations management roles focused on continuous improvement.

**DAWIA LOG-2 or LOG-3 certifications** - If targeting DoD civilian or defense contractor positions. Required for senior logistics positions in DoD. Cost: $0 (training via DAU). Time: 6-12 months. Value: Required for senior DoD logistics management.

## The degree question: Do you really need it?

**Short answer: Yes.**

**Long answer:** 90% of management and director positions require a bachelor's degree. Many director and VP roles prefer or require a master's (MBA or MS).

Can you find exceptions? Yes. Some 0491s land management roles without degrees based purely on experience. But you're competing against civilian candidates with degrees AND 10-15 years experience. The degree levels the playing field.

**If you don't have a bachelor's, here's your action plan:**

1. **Use your GI Bill immediately.** Don't delay. You're leaving money and opportunity on the table.

2. **Choose an accredited online program** designed for working adults: Arizona State University Online, Penn State World Campus, Colorado State University Global, UMUC, or similar.

3. **Leverage military credit.** Your military logistics training counts for 30-60 credits. You can complete a bachelor's in 12-24 months.

4. **Work while studying.** Take a logistics coordinator or analyst role ($55K-$75K) while finishing your degree, then leverage the degree + experience + certifications to jump to management ($95K-$130K+).

5. **Consider a master's next.** Many employers offer tuition assistance. Earn your MBA part-time while working in a management role. MBA opens doors to director and VP positions.

**Bottom line:** The degree requirement is real. Face it head-on, knock it out quickly, and it opens doors worth $100K+ in additional lifetime earnings.

## Action plan: Your first 180 days out

As a senior professional, your transition requires more strategic planning:

### Months 1-2: Credential assessment and planning
- **Assess your degree status.** Do you have a bachelor's? If not, enroll immediately using GI Bill.
- If you have a bachelor's, consider master's degree programs (MBA or MS in Supply Chain). Research programs.
- Update resume for senior management positions (use translation table above)
- Set up executive-level LinkedIn profile highlighting strategic logistics leadership
- Join professional associations: CSCMP, APICS/ASCM, PMI
- Get 10 copies of DD-214
- Verify clearance status (if applicable)

### Months 3-4: Certifications and networking
- Register for CSCP or CPIM (begin studying while job hunting)
- If targeting defense: Register for DAWIA training; consider PMP
- Network aggressively: LinkedIn connections with supply chain executives, veteran logistics professionals, recruiters specializing in supply chain
- Attend industry conferences (if possible): CSCMP Annual Conference, APICS events, logistics trade shows
- Research target companies: Who's hiring senior logistics leaders? What industries align with your background?

### Months 5-6: Applications and interviews
- Apply to 10-15 senior positions per week (quality over quantity—tailor each application)
- Target roles: Logistics Manager, Supply Chain Manager, Distribution Center Manager, Senior Logistics Analyst, Program Manager
- Work with executive recruiters specializing in supply chain and operations
- Practice executive interviews: Focus on strategic thinking, business results, P&L impact, leadership examples
- Prepare for behavioral questions: STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Be patient—senior hiring processes take 2-6 months from application to offer

### Months 7+: Bridging strategy (if needed)
- If you haven't landed a management role by Month 6-7, consider "bridging" strategy:
  - Take a coordinator or analyst role ($55K-$75K) to get civilian experience while finishing degree/certifications
  - Leverage that experience + credentials to jump to management ($95K-$130K) within 12-24 months
- Continue networking and applying while in bridging role
- Use bridging role to learn civilian logistics software, business operations, and company culture

## Bottom line for 0491s

You're not an entry-level logistics professional—you're a senior operations leader with 10-20 years of strategic logistics experience.

But civilian transition requires bridging the credential gap. A bachelor's degree (and ideally master's for director roles) plus industry certifications (CSCP, CPIM, PMP) legitimize your experience in civilian HR systems.

With the right credentials, your military logistics leadership translates directly into management and director positions paying $90K-$180K+. You've already proven you can lead large operations, manage complex supply chains, coordinate across organizations, and advise senior executives. Now you need to translate that into civilian language and credentials.

First civilian role: $90K-$130K is realistic for management positions. Within 5-7 years: $130K-$165K for senior management. Within 10-12 years: $165K-$200K+ for director and VP positions.

Don't sell yourself short by taking coordinator roles (unless bridging strategically). You're a senior leader. Target management and director positions. Invest in the credentials required. And recognize that your military logistics leadership is worth six figures in the civilian market.

You've coordinated enterprise logistics operations supporting national defense. Companies will pay you well to do the same for their supply chains.

Go get what you're worth.
