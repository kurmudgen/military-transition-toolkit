# Depression Secondary to PTSD: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - This is one of the most commonly approved secondary conditions
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 30-50%
- **Key evidence needed:** PTSD diagnosis, depression diagnosis, nexus letter, treatment records
- **Success rate:** High (approximately 70-80% with proper documentation)

Depression secondary to PTSD is one of the strongest secondary claims veterans can file. The medical connection between PTSD and depression is well-established in psychiatric literature, making this a highly favorable claim when properly documented.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

A secondary service-connected condition is a disability that was caused or aggravated by an already service-connected condition. Under 38 CFR § 3.310, the VA recognizes that primary service-connected conditions often lead to additional medical problems.

For depression secondary to PTSD:
- Your PTSD must already be service-connected
- Your depression must be diagnosed by a medical professional
- A medical professional must establish that your PTSD caused or worsened your depression

**Important:** Secondary conditions are rated separately from your primary condition, which can significantly increase your combined VA rating and monthly compensation.

## How Depression Relates to PTSD

### Medical Connection

PTSD and depression share overlapping neurobiological pathways and frequently co-occur. The connection happens through several mechanisms:

**Neurochemical Changes:** PTSD causes dysregulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and cortisol - the same neurotransmitters involved in depression. Chronic stress from PTSD depletes these chemicals over time, leading to depressive symptoms.

**HPA Axis Dysfunction:** The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis becomes chronically activated in PTSD, leading to elevated cortisol levels. This sustained stress response damages brain regions responsible for mood regulation, particularly the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

**Avoidance and Isolation:** PTSD symptoms like avoidance and emotional numbing lead to social isolation, reduced activities, and loss of pleasure - all direct pathways to depression.

**Sleep Disruption:** PTSD-related nightmares and hypervigilance cause chronic sleep deprivation, which is a major risk factor for developing depression.

### Common Progression

**Months 1-6 after PTSD onset:** Veterans typically experience initial PTSD symptoms - flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance. Depression may begin with feelings of hopelessness about recovery.

**Months 6-18:** As PTSD symptoms persist, social withdrawal increases. Veterans often stop activities they once enjoyed. Depressive symptoms intensify - low mood, fatigue, concentration problems.

**Months 18-36:** Full-blown major depressive disorder often develops. Veterans may experience suicidal ideation, significant weight changes, and inability to function in work or relationships.

**Beyond 36 months:** Without treatment, both conditions become chronic and mutually reinforcing. Each condition worsens the other in a destructive cycle.

### Prevalence

The co-occurrence of PTSD and depression is remarkably high:

- **52% of veterans** with PTSD also meet criteria for major depressive disorder
- **Up to 80% of combat veterans** with PTSD report significant depressive symptoms
- Veterans with PTSD are **3-5 times more likely** to develop depression than those without PTSD
- The combination of PTSD and depression increases suicide risk **10-fold** compared to either condition alone

## VA Rating Criteria for Depression

Depression is rated under the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities under Diagnostic Code 9434 (Major Depressive Disorder). The same General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders applies:

| Rating | Symptoms | Monthly Compensation (2025) |
|--------|----------|----------------------------|
| 0% | Diagnosis confirmed, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with occupational/social functioning or require continuous medication | $0.00 |
| 10% | Mild symptoms controlled by continuous medication; occupational/social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms | $171.23 |
| 30% | Occasional decrease in work efficiency with intermittent inability to perform tasks; depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss | $524.31 |
| 50% | Reduced reliability and productivity; flattened affect, difficulty understanding complex commands, impaired judgment, disturbances in motivation and mood, difficulty maintaining relationships | $1,075.16 |
| 70% | Deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood); suicidal ideation, near-continuous depression, impaired impulse control, difficulty adapting to stress, inability to maintain relationships | $1,716.28 |
| 100% | Total occupational and social impairment; gross impairment in thought processes, persistent danger of hurting self or others, inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation, severe memory loss | $3,737.85 |

**Important Note:** The VA uses the "Pyramiding" rule (38 CFR § 4.14), which prohibits rating the same symptoms twice. If your depression symptoms overlap with your PTSD symptoms, the VA may combine them into a single mental health rating rather than awarding separate ratings. A skilled examiner can distinguish between the conditions.

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition (PTSD)
- Service connection decision letter showing PTSD is service-connected
- Current PTSD rating percentage
- Complete treatment history for PTSD
- C&P exam results from PTSD claim
- Medication history for PTSD

#### For Your Secondary Condition (Depression)
- Formal diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder from a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other qualified mental health professional
- Treatment records (minimum 6 months preferred, ideally 12+ months)
- Medication history (antidepressants prescribed and duration)
- Therapy records documenting depressive symptoms
- Any hospitalizations for depression
- PHQ-9 or Beck Depression Inventory scores over time

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

The nexus letter is the single most important piece of evidence for your secondary claim. It must establish the causal connection between your service-connected PTSD and your depression.

**Required Elements:**

1. **Doctor's credentials** - Must be a qualified medical professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, or physician)
2. **Review statement** - Explicit statement that they reviewed your complete medical records
3. **Magic language** - "At least as likely as not" (50% or greater probability) statement
4. **Medical reasoning** - Detailed explanation of how PTSD caused or aggravated depression
5. **Supporting literature** - Citations to medical studies showing the PTSD-depression connection

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's name]'s complete medical records, including service treatment records, VA treatment records, and private medical records. [Veteran] is currently service-connected for PTSD at [X]%.*

*It is my professional medical opinion that [Veteran]'s currently diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder is at least as likely as not (50% probability or greater) caused by his/her service-connected PTSD.*

*The medical reasoning supporting this opinion is as follows: PTSD and depression share common neurobiological pathways involving serotonin dysregulation and HPA axis dysfunction. Medical literature establishes that 52% of individuals with PTSD develop comorbid major depression (Rytwinski et al., 2013). [Veteran]'s medical records document the onset of depressive symptoms approximately [X] months following PTSD diagnosis, consistent with the typical progression of secondary depression. The veteran's depression is characterized by [specific symptoms] which emerged after and are directly related to the functional impairments caused by PTSD, including social isolation, chronic sleep disruption, and diminished engagement in previously enjoyed activities.*

*Additionally, [Veteran]'s PTSD medications, including [medication names], have known depressogenic side effects that have contributed to the severity of the depressive disorder.*

*Based on my clinical expertise and review of the medical evidence, the veteran's depression would not exist but for the service-connected PTSD."*

### Supporting Evidence

**Personal Statement (VA Form 21-4138)**
Write a detailed statement describing:
- When you first noticed depressive symptoms
- How your PTSD symptoms led to depression
- Specific examples of how depression affects your daily life
- Impact on work, relationships, and activities

**Buddy Statements**
Ask fellow veterans, friends, or coworkers to write statements about:
- Changes in your mood and behavior they've observed
- Specific incidents demonstrating depressive symptoms

**Spouse/Family Statements**
Family members can provide powerful testimony about:
- Changes in your personality since PTSD developed
- Daily struggles with depression they witness
- Impact on family relationships and home life
- Sleep disturbances and nightmares they observe

**Employment Records**
- Performance reviews showing declining work performance
- Disciplinary records related to attendance or concentration issues
- Termination records citing mental health-related issues
- Requests for accommodation

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Verify PTSD Service Connection (Before Starting)

### Step 2: Get Current Depression Diagnosis (Weeks 1-4)
- Schedule appointment with VA mental health or private psychiatrist/psychologist
- Request formal evaluation for depression
- Complete depression screening tools (PHQ-9, Beck Depression Inventory)
- Get official diagnosis documented in medical records
- Begin treatment immediately (shows condition severity)

### Step 3: Obtain Nexus Letter (Weeks 5-8)
- Find qualified medical professional experienced with VA nexus letters
- Provide complete copies of:
  - Service treatment records
  - VA treatment records for both PTSD and depression
  - PTSD rating decision
  - Medication history

- Typical cost: $500-$1,500 for nexus letter

### Step 4: Gather Supporting Evidence (Weeks 9-10)
- Write detailed personal statement
- Request buddy statements from 2-3 people
- Obtain spouse/family statements
- Compile all treatment records
- Document daily impact (consider keeping symptom journal)

### Step 5: File Intent to File (Week 11)
- Submit Intent to File on VA.gov
- This establishes your effective date for backpay purposes
- You have one year to submit complete claim

### Step 6: File Claim (Week 11-12)
- File on VA.gov or through VSO
- Submit VA Form 21-526EZ
- Select "secondary" as claim type
- Identify PTSD as the primary condition
- Upload all evidence including nexus letter

- Exam will likely be with a psychologist or psychiatrist
- Be completely honest about symptoms - describe your worst days
- Don't minimize symptoms or try to appear "strong"
- Bring copies of your evidence to the exam
- The examiner will provide a DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire) opinion

### Step 8: Wait for Decision (Weeks 25-36)
- Average processing time: 4-6 months
- Check status on VA.gov
- Respond promptly to any VA requests for additional information

### Step 9: Receive Decision
- If approved: Backpay calculated from Intent to File date
- If denied: Review denial reasons and file Supplemental Claim with additional evidence

**Total timeline:** 6-9 months typical

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not having PTSD service-connected first** - Your primary condition must be service-connected before you can claim a secondary condition

2. **Filing without a nexus letter** - The VA rarely grants secondary claims without a clear medical nexus opinion

3. **Generic or weak nexus letters** - Letters that don't specifically explain the medical connection are often insufficient

4. **Inconsistent treatment records** - Gaps in treatment make the VA question condition severity

5. **Minimizing symptoms at C&P exam** - Many veterans downplay symptoms due to military culture; this hurts your claim

6. **Not describing your worst days** - The VA rates based on frequency and severity of your worst symptoms, not your best days

7. **Overlapping symptom descriptions** - Not distinguishing depression symptoms from PTSD symptoms can lead to combined rating rather than separate secondary rating

8. **Missing the Intent to File** - Not filing ITF first can cost you months of backpay

9. **Insufficient personal statements** - Vague statements without specific examples are less persuasive

10. **Not requesting medical records before filing** - Ensure all treatment is documented in records the VA will review

## Medical Research Supporting Connection

The PTSD-depression connection is among the most well-documented in psychiatric literature:

**Key Studies:**

- **Rytwinski et al. (2013)** - Meta-analysis found 52% comorbidity rate between PTSD and depression among military populations

- **Flory & Yehuda (2015)** - Demonstrated shared neurobiological mechanisms including HPA axis dysfunction and serotonergic dysregulation

- **Campbell et al. (2007)** - Found that PTSD symptoms predict later depression, establishing temporal causation

- **Kessler et al. (2005)** - National Comorbidity Survey Replication showed PTSD has higher comorbidity with depression than any other anxiety disorder

- **Ginzburg et al. (2010)** - Longitudinal study demonstrated that PTSD severity predicts depression severity over time

**VA's Own Recognition:**
The VA's own medical literature and training materials acknowledge the strong relationship between PTSD and depression, making this a well-accepted secondary connection.

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Approved - Army Infantry Veteran

**Background:** 32-year-old male, Iraq veteran, 70% for PTSD
**Timeline:** Filed secondary claim 3 years after PTSD rating

**Evidence Submitted:**
- Nexus letter from private psychiatrist
- 18 months of VA mental health treatment records
- Personal statement describing depression onset
- Wife's statement about personality changes
- Prescription records showing antidepressant medications

**Outcome:** Approved at 30% for depression secondary to PTSD
**Combined Rating:** Increased from 70% to 80%
**Monthly Increase:** $715.97 additional per month
**Backpay:** $7,159.70 (10 months from Intent to File)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Strong nexus letter with specific medical reasoning
- Consistent treatment records showing depression diagnosis
- Compelling personal and spouse statements
- Clear documentation distinguishing depression symptoms from PTSD symptoms

### Case Study 2: Initially Denied, Later Approved - Marine Corps Veteran

**Background:** 28-year-old female, Afghanistan veteran, 50% for PTSD
**Initial Outcome:** Denied - VA determined symptoms were part of PTSD rating

**Denial Reasoning:** C&P examiner found depression symptoms were "accounted for in PTSD rating" and did not constitute separate disability

**Appeal Strategy:**
1. Obtained new nexus letter from independent psychiatrist
2. Letter specifically addressed how depression symptoms were distinct from PTSD
3. Included detailed symptom comparison chart
4. Added medical literature citations
5. Filed Supplemental Claim with new evidence

**Second Outcome:** Approved at 50% for depression secondary to PTSD
**Combined Rating:** Increased from 50% to 70%
**Monthly Increase:** $641.12 additional per month

**Key Lesson:** When depression symptoms overlap with PTSD, you need a nexus letter that specifically explains which symptoms are attributable to depression versus PTSD and why they warrant separate ratings.

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

The VA uses "VA math" - not simple addition - to calculate combined ratings. Here's how adding depression secondary to PTSD affects your overall rating:

**Example 1: PTSD 70% + Depression 30%**
- Start with highest rating: 70% disabled, 30% "healthy"
- Apply next rating to remaining healthy percentage: 30% of 30% = 9%
- Combined: 70% + 9% = 79% → Rounds to 80%
- Monthly compensation increases from $1,716.28 to $1,995.01

**Example 2: PTSD 50% + Depression 50%**
- Start with 50% disabled, 50% "healthy"
- Apply 50% to remaining: 50% of 50% = 25%
- Combined: 50% + 25% = 75% → Rounds to 80%
- Monthly compensation increases from $1,075.16 to $1,995.01

**Example 3: Multiple Conditions**
- PTSD: 70%
- Depression: 30%
- Tinnitus: 10%
- Back condition: 20%
- Combined calculation: 70% → 79% → 81% → 85% → Rounds to 90%
- Monthly compensation: $2,241.91

**Special Consideration:** If you already have another mental health condition rated, adding depression may not increase your rating significantly due to pyramiding rules. However, having multiple documented mental health conditions can support a higher single mental health rating.

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Depression symptoms are contemplated in PTSD rating"** - VA found overlapping symptoms
2. **"No nexus established"** - Insufficient medical evidence linking conditions
3. **"Condition existed prior to PTSD"** - VA claims depression was pre-existing
4. **"Symptoms not severe enough for compensable rating"** - Meets diagnosis but not rating criteria
5. **"Insufficient evidence of current disability"** - Gaps in treatment records

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim (Most Common)**
- Add new and relevant evidence
- Obtain stronger nexus letter
- Add additional treatment records
- Include new personal/buddy statements
- Timeline: 4-6 months for decision

**Higher-Level Review**
- Same evidence, different reviewer
- Alleges error in original decision
- No new evidence allowed
- Timeline: 4-6 months for decision

**Board Appeal**
- Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals
- Can add new evidence
- Can request hearing
- Timeline: 12-24+ months for decision

### Strengthening Your Claim

1. **Get a stronger nexus letter** - Find a psychiatrist experienced with VA claims who can write a detailed, specific opinion

2. **Distinguish your symptoms** - Work with your mental health provider to document which symptoms are depression-specific versus PTSD-related

3. **Increase treatment frequency** - More treatment records demonstrate severity and provide more documentation

4. **Request a new C&P exam** - If the examiner's opinion was flawed, a new exam with better evidence can yield different results

5. **Consider an Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)** - A detailed IMO from a specialist can overcome a negative C&P exam opinion

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I claim depression secondary to PTSD if my depression existed before PTSD?**
A: Possibly. If your PTSD aggravated (worsened) pre-existing depression, you can claim it as aggravated by your service-connected condition. You would need medical evidence showing the worsening.

**Q: Do I need a separate diagnosis of depression, or is it included in PTSD?**
A: You need a separate, formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, etc.) to claim it as secondary. General depressive symptoms may be considered part of PTSD.

**Q: What if my depression started before I was rated for PTSD?**
A: The key is whether your PTSD caused or worsened the depression. If medical evidence establishes that PTSD (the condition, not the rating) caused your depression, you can still file a secondary claim.

**Q: Can I get 100% combined rating with PTSD and depression?**
A: Yes, it's possible. For example, 70% PTSD + 70% depression + other conditions can reach 100% combined.

**Q: How long after PTSD diagnosis can I claim secondary depression?**
A: There's no time limit. However, shorter timeframes between PTSD and depression diagnoses strengthen the causal connection.

**Q: Do I need to see a psychiatrist, or can my VA primary care provider diagnose depression?**
A: While any qualified medical professional can diagnose depression, a diagnosis from a psychiatrist or psychologist carries more weight with the VA.

**Q: What if the C&P examiner says my depression is part of my PTSD?**
A: This is common and frustrating. Your nexus letter should specifically address why depression is a separate condition. You can file a Supplemental Claim with additional evidence.

**Q: Can I claim depression secondary to PTSD medications?**
A: Yes! Many PTSD medications have depressogenic side effects. Your nexus letter can address both the direct PTSD-depression connection AND medication-induced depression.

**Q: Will claiming secondary depression affect my PTSD rating?**
A: Generally no. Your PTSD rating should remain unchanged. However, during re-evaluation, the VA may adjust any rating.

**Q: What's the average processing time for secondary mental health claims?**
A: Currently 4-8 months, though this varies by VA Regional Office.

**Q: Can I work while receiving VA disability for depression?**
A: Yes. VA disability compensation is not based on employment status unless you're claiming unemployability (TDIU).

**Q: Is depression secondary to PTSD permanent?**
A: Ratings under 100% are typically subject to review. However, after 20 years at the same rating or if you're over 55, ratings become protected.

**Q: What if I'm already rated 100% for PTSD?**
A: You can still claim secondary conditions. While it won't increase your monthly compensation (unless you qualify for Special Monthly Compensation), it protects your overall rating and may qualify you for additional benefits.

**Q: Can I claim multiple secondary conditions to PTSD?**
A: Absolutely. Veterans commonly claim depression, anxiety, insomnia, sleep apnea, and other conditions secondary to PTSD.

**Q: Do I need an attorney to file a secondary claim?**
A: No, but complex claims benefit from professional help. VSOs provide free assistance. Attorneys and claims agents can help with appeals.

**Q: How much does a nexus letter typically cost?**
A: Private nexus letters range from $500-$2,500 depending on complexity and provider qualifications.

**Q: Can I use VA mental health treatment records for my claim?**
A: Yes, and you should. VA records are automatically available to VA claims processors.

**Q: What if I've never sought treatment for depression?**
A: Start treatment immediately. While you can file without treatment records, claims are much stronger with documented treatment history.

**Q: How do I prove my depression is different from my PTSD?**
A: Your mental health provider and nexus letter writer should document distinct symptoms. Depression-specific symptoms include: persistent sadness, anhedonia (loss of pleasure), significant weight/appetite changes, psychomotor retardation, and excessive guilt.

**Q: Can I get Individual Unemployability (TDIU) based on PTSD and depression combined?**
A: Yes. If your combined mental health conditions prevent substantial gainful employment, you may qualify for TDIU at the 100% compensation rate.

**Q: Will the VA schedule a C&P exam for secondary depression?**
A: Usually yes. The VA typically requires a C&P exam to evaluate secondary mental health claims.

**Q: What happens if my secondary depression claim is denied?**
A: You have multiple appeal options: Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or Board Appeal. You have one year from the decision date to appeal.

**Q: Can secondary depression rating be combined with anxiety rating?**
A: The VA typically issues one rating for all mental health conditions under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. However, having multiple diagnosed conditions can support a higher rating.
