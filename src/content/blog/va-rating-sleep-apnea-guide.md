# VA Rating for Sleep Apnea: Complete Compensation Guide (2025)

Sleep apnea is one of the highest-value VA disability claims you can file. The ratings—0%, 30%, 50%, or 100%—can mean the difference between $0 and $3,900+ per month in tax-free compensation.

Here's the reality: if you use a CPAP machine, you should be rated at 50% minimum. That's $1,110.55/month for a single veteran with no dependents in 2025. Yet thousands of veterans are either undiagnosed or under-rated because they don't understand how the VA evaluates sleep apnea.

This guide covers everything you need to maximize your sleep apnea claim.

## Sleep Apnea VA Rating Criteria

The VA rates sleep apnea under Diagnostic Code 6847. Your rating depends entirely on what treatment you require—not how severe your AHI score is.

### Rating Breakdown

| Rating | Monthly Payment (2025) | Criteria |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| **0%** | $0 | Documented sleep apnea, asymptomatic |
| **30%** | $524.31 | Persistent daytime hypersomnolence (excessive sleepiness) |
| **50%** | $1,110.55 | Requires CPAP or other breathing assistance device |
| **100%** | $3,906.04 | Chronic respiratory failure with CO2 retention, cor pulmonale, OR requires tracheostomy |

### What This Means in Practice

**0% Rating**: You have a documented diagnosis but no symptoms requiring treatment. This is rare—most diagnosed veterans need some form of treatment.

**30% Rating**: You experience excessive daytime sleepiness but don't use a CPAP. This is uncommon because most sleep apnea diagnoses result in CPAP prescription.

**50% Rating**: This is the most common rating. If your doctor prescribed a CPAP, BiPAP, or APAP machine, you qualify for 50%. Period. You don't need to prove you use it perfectly—the prescription is what matters.

**100% Rating**: Reserved for severe cases involving respiratory failure, right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale), or surgical tracheostomy. Very rare for sleep apnea alone.

## The CPAP Requirement Explained

The 50% rating hinges on one thing: do you require a breathing assistance device?

**What qualifies:**
- CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)
- BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)
- APAP (Automatic Positive Airway Pressure)
- ASV (Adaptive Servo-Ventilation)

**What doesn't qualify for 50%:**
- Oral appliances (dental devices)
- Positional therapy
- Weight loss treatment alone

**Important**: If you were prescribed a CPAP but can't tolerate it, you may still qualify for 50% based on the prescription. Document your attempts to use it and reasons for intolerance.

## Proving Service Connection

Here's where most sleep apnea claims fail. The VA won't give you a rating without evidence connecting your sleep apnea to military service.

### Direct Service Connection

This requires proof that your sleep apnea began during or was caused by military service:

- In-service sleep study showing diagnosis (rare)
- Service treatment records documenting symptoms:
  - Complaints of fatigue or daytime sleepiness
  - Witnessed apneas noted by medical staff
  - Chronic snoring complaints
- Buddy statements from bunkmates describing loud snoring, gasping, or witnessed breathing stops

**Reality check**: Most service members weren't tested for sleep apnea during service. Sleep studies weren't routine. If you don't have in-service documentation, focus on secondary connection.

### Secondary Service Connection (Most Common)

Secondary connection means your sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by another service-connected condition. This is how most veterans win sleep apnea claims.

**Strongest secondary connections:**

1. **PTSD → Sleep Apnea**
   - Multiple peer-reviewed studies show PTSD significantly increases sleep apnea risk
   - Mechanism: increased sympathetic nervous system activity, sleep fragmentation, upper airway changes
   - If you're service-connected for PTSD, this is your strongest argument

2. **Weight Gain from Service-Connected Conditions → Sleep Apnea**
   - Can't exercise due to back, knee, or ankle injuries
   - Weight-causing medications for depression, anxiety, or pain
   - Direct correlation between obesity and obstructive sleep apnea

3. **Sinusitis/Rhinitis → Sleep Apnea**
   - Nasal obstruction contributes to airway collapse
   - Common among veterans with burn pit exposure

4. **TBI → Sleep Apnea**
   - Traumatic brain injury affects sleep regulation
   - Strong medical literature supporting connection

5. **Hypertension → Sleep Apnea** (bidirectional)
   - These conditions commonly occur together
   - Can argue either direction depending on which was diagnosed first

### The Nexus Letter

For secondary claims, you need a nexus opinion—a medical statement connecting your conditions.

**What makes a strong nexus letter:**
- Written by a qualified medical professional (MD, DO, NP, PA)
- Reviews your complete medical history
- Cites peer-reviewed medical literature
- Explains the physiological mechanism
- Uses the magic words: "at least as likely as not"

**Where to get one:**
- VA C&P examiner (free, but you can't control the outcome)
- Your private physician ($100-300)
- Medical opinion services ($500-1,500)
- Independent Medical Examiners ($1,000-3,000)

If your claim is denied, investing in a quality nexus letter for appeal often makes the difference.

## Getting Your Sleep Study

You need a documented diagnosis before filing your claim.

### Types of Sleep Studies

**Polysomnography (PSG)** - In-lab overnight study
- Most comprehensive
- Monitors brain waves, oxygen, heart rate, breathing, movement
- Gold standard but harder to schedule

**Home Sleep Test (HST)** - At-home device
- Monitors breathing and oxygen
- Convenient and widely available
- VA accepts these for rating purposes

### Key Numbers from Your Sleep Study

**AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index)** - Number of breathing interruptions per hour:
- 5-14: Mild sleep apnea
- 15-29: Moderate sleep apnea
- 30+: Severe sleep apnea

**Important**: The VA doesn't rate based on AHI severity. A mild case requiring CPAP gets the same 50% as a severe case. What matters is the treatment prescribed.

### How to Get Tested

1. **VA Healthcare**: Schedule through your VA primary care. Request a sleep study referral.
2. **Private Insurance**: See a sleep specialist or pulmonologist.
3. **Community Care**: If VA wait times are long, request community care referral.

Get tested before you file. Having the diagnosis and CPAP prescription in hand strengthens your claim.

## C&P Exam Preparation

The Compensation & Pension exam can make or break your claim. Here's how to prepare.

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about symptom history and onset
3. Verify your sleep study results
4. Confirm CPAP prescription and usage
5. Assess current symptoms
6. **Provide a nexus opinion** (critical for secondary claims)

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- When did your sleep problems start?
- When were you diagnosed?
- Do you use a CPAP machine?
- How often do you use it?
- What symptoms do you experience?
- (For secondary) What service-connected condition do you believe caused your sleep apnea?

### How to Respond

**Be specific about timeline**: "I started experiencing fatigue and my wife noticed I stopped breathing during sleep in 2018, about two years after I was service-connected for PTSD."

**Describe your worst days**: "Even with CPAP, I still experience excessive daytime fatigue. I struggle to stay awake during meetings and have to pull over while driving sometimes."

**Connect the dots for secondary claims**: "My doctor explained that PTSD increases the risk of sleep apnea through stress hormones affecting the airway. I've included the medical literature supporting this."

### What to Bring

- Copy of your sleep study with AHI results
- CPAP prescription
- CPAP compliance data (if favorable)
- List of current symptoms
- Buddy statements
- Medical literature for secondary claims
- Your own notes on symptom history

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Saying "I feel fine"** - Describe your worst symptoms honestly
2. **Not knowing your sleep study results** - Know your AHI score
3. **Downplaying CPAP usage** - If you use it, say so
4. **Vague timeline** - Be specific about when symptoms started
5. **Not explaining secondary connection** - Don't assume the examiner will figure it out

## Secondary Conditions to Claim WITH Sleep Apnea

If your sleep apnea is service-connected, these conditions may be secondary TO it:

### Hypertension (10-60%)
- Sleep apnea causes repeated oxygen drops that stress the cardiovascular system
- Strong medical literature supporting this connection
- Very common secondary claim

### Heart Conditions (Various ratings)
- Atrial fibrillation
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart failure
- All linked to untreated sleep apnea

### Type 2 Diabetes (10-100%)
- Sleep apnea contributes to insulin resistance
- Especially strong if you developed diabetes after sleep apnea diagnosis

### Erectile Dysfunction (0% + SMC-K)
- Sleep apnea commonly causes ED
- ED itself is rated 0% but qualifies for Special Monthly Compensation K ($131.64/month extra)

### GERD (10-60%)
- Air pressure changes affect the esophagus
- Very common in CPAP users

### Cognitive Disorder (0-100%)
- Chronic sleep deprivation affects memory and concentration
- Can be rated under TBI or mental health diagnostic codes

### Depression/Anxiety (0-100%)
- Living with chronic fatigue affects mental health
- Can be secondary to sleep apnea (or vice versa)

## Filing Your Claim

### Step 1: Gather Evidence
- Current sleep study showing diagnosis
- CPAP prescription
- Service treatment records (if applicable)
- Post-service medical records
- Buddy statements
- Nexus letter (for secondary claims)

### Step 2: Choose Your Claim Type

**Fully Developed Claim (FDC)**: You have all evidence ready. Faster processing (3-4 months average).

**Standard Claim**: VA helps gather evidence. Slower processing (6-8 months average).

For sleep apnea, FDC is usually better if you have your documentation ready.

### Step 3: File Through VA.gov

1. Log into VA.gov
2. Navigate to "File a disability claim"
3. Select "sleep apnea" as the condition
4. If secondary, select the primary condition it's connected to
5. Upload all supporting evidence
6. Submit and track your claim

### Step 4: Attend C&P Exam
VA will schedule an exam. Don't miss it—missed exams often result in denial.

## If Your Claim Is Denied

Don't give up. Sleep apnea denials are common but highly appealable.

### Appeal Options

**Supplemental Claim** (Best for new evidence)
- Add nexus letter from private physician
- Submit buddy statements you didn't have before
- Provide medical literature supporting your theory

**Higher-Level Review** (Best for errors)
- Request senior reviewer examine the decision
- Appropriate when evidence was ignored or misweighed
- No new evidence allowed

**Board of Veterans Appeals** (Best for complex cases)
- Longer wait but thorough review
- Can request hearing with judge
- Can submit new evidence with certain lanes

### Common Denial Reasons and Responses

**"No nexus to service"**
→ Get Independent Medical Opinion specifically addressing connection

**"Sleep apnea not diagnosed until years after service"**
→ Argue sleep apnea existed but was undiagnosed; provide buddy statements about snoring during service

**"Attributed to weight gain after service"**
→ If weight gain is from service-connected condition, document that chain of causation

**"Negative C&P opinion"**
→ Submit private positive nexus opinion contradicting VA examiner

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a sleep study from during service?
No. Most veterans weren't tested during service. You can establish connection through secondary claims or symptom documentation.

### Does my AHI score affect my rating?
No. A mild case (AHI 5-14) with CPAP gets the same 50% as a severe case (AHI 30+) with CPAP. Only treatment requirements matter.

### What if I can't tolerate CPAP?
You may still qualify for 50% based on the prescription. Document why you can't use it.

### Can I claim sleep apnea secondary to PTSD?
Yes. This is one of the strongest secondary connections. Multiple studies support the link.

### How long does a sleep apnea claim take?
Average is 4-6 months for initial claims. Can be faster with Fully Developed Claims.

### What if I was diagnosed years after service?
Focus on secondary connection. Many veterans develop sleep apnea from service-connected conditions years later.
