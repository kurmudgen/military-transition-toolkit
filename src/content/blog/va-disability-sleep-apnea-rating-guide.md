# VA Disability Rating for Sleep Apnea: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Sleep apnea is one of the most valuable VA disability claims, with ratings of **0%, 30%, 50%, or 100%** under Diagnostic Code 6847. The most common rating is **50%** for veterans who require a CPAP machine. If you use a CPAP (or BIPAP), you should receive at least 50%. The key challenge is proving **service connection**—that your sleep apnea is related to military service either directly or secondary to another condition like PTSD, weight gain from service-connected disabilities, or in-service exposures. Claims typically take 4-8 months due to nexus complexity.

## What Is Sleep Apnea and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The most common type, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), occurs when throat muscles relax and block the airway. This causes oxygen desaturation, fragmented sleep, and numerous health consequences.

**Symptoms include:**
- Loud snoring
- Episodes of stopped breathing during sleep (witnessed by others)
- Gasping or choking during sleep
- Waking with dry mouth
- Morning headache
- Insomnia
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Irritability

**Common military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Symptoms began during service (documented snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness)
- In-service sleep study showing sleep apnea
- Environmental exposures (burn pits, chemicals) affecting airways

**Secondary service connection (most common path):**
- **PTSD**: Research shows strong correlation between PTSD and sleep apnea
- **Weight gain**: From inability to exercise due to service-connected orthopedic conditions
- **Rhinitis/sinusitis**: Nasal obstruction contributing to apnea
- **Obesity medications**: Weight gain from psychiatric medications for service-connected conditions
- **TBI**: Brain injury affecting sleep regulation

**Aggravation by service:**
- Pre-existing sleep apnea worsened by service conditions
- Weight gain during service
- Stress and sleep deprivation

## VA Rating Criteria for Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is rated under **38 CFR § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847**.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Asymptomatic but with documented sleep disorder breathing |
| **30%** | Persistent daytime hypersomnolence (excessive sleepiness) |
| **50%** | Requires use of breathing assistance device such as CPAP (continuous airway pressure) machine |
| **100%** | Chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure), OR requires tracheostomy |

### What Each Rating Really Means

**0%**: You have documented sleep apnea but no symptoms requiring treatment. Rare—most people diagnosed need treatment.

**30%**: You have excessive daytime sleepiness but don't use a CPAP. This is uncommon since most diagnosed veterans are prescribed CPAP.

**50%**: You use a CPAP or BIPAP machine. **This is the most common rating.** If you have a CPAP prescription and use it, you should receive 50%.

**100%**: Reserved for severe cases with respiratory failure or tracheostomy. Rare for sleep apnea alone.

### Important Rating Notes

- If you're prescribed a CPAP but can't tolerate it, you may still get 50% if the prescription exists
- CPAP alternatives (oral appliances, positional therapy) may not qualify for 50%
- Home sleep tests (HST) are acceptable; you don't need a full in-lab polysomnography
- The severity of your AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) doesn't affect the rating—only the treatment required matters

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

This is where most sleep apnea claims fail. You need strong evidence connecting sleep apnea to service.

**For direct service connection:**
- In-service sleep study or diagnosis (rare)
- Service treatment records showing:
  - Complaints of fatigue, daytime sleepiness
  - Witnessed apnea events documented
  - Snoring complaints
  - Sleep disturbance issues
- Buddy statements from bunkmates about snoring
- Statements from spouse/partner about snoring during service

**For secondary service connection (strongest path):**
- Documentation of already service-connected condition (PTSD, depression, orthopedic)
- Medical literature supporting the connection
- Nexus opinion from qualified medical provider explaining:
  - How the primary condition causes or contributes to sleep apnea
  - The physiological mechanism

**Common secondary connections:**
1. **PTSD → Sleep Apnea**: Studies show PTSD significantly increases sleep apnea risk
2. **Orthopedic conditions → Weight gain → Sleep Apnea**: Can't exercise, gained weight, developed apnea
3. **Medications → Weight gain → Sleep Apnea**: Psychiatric meds cause weight gain
4. **Rhinitis → Sleep Apnea**: Nasal obstruction contributes to apnea
5. **TBI → Sleep Apnea**: Brain injury affects sleep regulation

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **Sleep study** (polysomnography or home sleep test) showing:
   - AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) of 5 or higher confirms diagnosis
   - Documented oxygen desaturations
   - Sleep architecture abnormalities

2. **CPAP prescription** and records showing:
   - Date prescribed
   - Compliance data (if available)
   - Settings

3. **Treatment records** showing ongoing care for sleep apnea

### Nexus Evidence (Critical)

For secondary claims, you need a nexus opinion—a medical statement that your sleep apnea is "at least as likely as not" related to your service-connected condition.

**Options for nexus opinions:**
1. **C&P examiner opinion** (requested by VA)
2. **Private physician opinion** (pay out of pocket)
3. **Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)** (specialized providers)

**A strong nexus opinion includes:**
- Review of your medical history
- Citation of medical literature
- Clear statement of the connection
- Explanation of the physiological mechanism
- "At least as likely as not" language

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The sleep apnea C&P exam will determine service connection and severity.

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about sleep apnea history and symptoms
3. Verify sleep study results
4. Confirm CPAP use
5. Assess current symptoms
6. **Provide a nexus opinion** (critical part)

**Questions you'll be asked:**
- "When did your sleep problems start?"
- "When were you diagnosed with sleep apnea?"
- "Do you use a CPAP machine?"
- "How often do you use it?"
- "What symptoms do you have?"

**For secondary claims:**
- "What service-connected condition do you believe caused your sleep apnea?"
- "How do you think they're connected?"

**What to tell them:**

1. **Establish timeline**: "I started having symptoms [during service/shortly after]"
2. **Confirm CPAP use**: "I use my CPAP every night"
3. **Describe symptoms**: Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, witnessed apneas
4. **For secondary claims**: Clearly explain your theory of connection
5. **Provide documentation**: Bring sleep study results, CPAP prescription

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Not knowing your sleep study results**: Know your AHI score
- **Not using your CPAP**: The examiner may check compliance records
- **Weak secondary connection argument**: Research the medical literature
- **No buddy statements about snoring during service**: These are powerful for direct claims
- **Vague onset timeline**: Be specific about when symptoms started

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Sleep Apnea

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "No nexus to military service"
**Why it happens:** Most common denial—examiner doesn't find service connection
**How to avoid:**
- Get private nexus opinion before filing
- Research secondary connection thoroughly
- Provide medical literature supporting connection

### 2. "Sleep apnea not diagnosed until years after service"
**Why it happens:** Delayed diagnosis seen as disconnect from service
**How to avoid:**
- Establish secondary connection (most veterans weren't tested during service)
- Get buddy statements about snoring during service
- Argue that sleep apnea existed but was undiagnosed

### 3. "Sleep apnea due to weight gain after service"
**Why it happens:** Examiner attributes to post-service lifestyle
**How to avoid:**
- If weight gain is from service-connected condition, document it
- Show weight trajectory: when and why you gained weight
- Get nexus opinion addressing weight gain mechanism

### 4. "Insufficient evidence of in-service symptoms"
**Why it happens:** No documentation of sleep issues during service
**How to avoid:**
- Buddy statements from bunkmates/roommates about snoring
- Statements about fatigue, sleepiness during service
- Focus on secondary connection instead

### 5. "Negative nexus opinion at C&P exam"
**Why it happens:** VA examiner opines against connection
**How to avoid:**
- Submit private positive nexus opinion first
- Be prepared to appeal with IMO

## How to Write a Strong Personal Statement

---

**Personal Statement for Sleep Apnea Claim**

I, [Full Name], am submitting this statement in support of my claim for service connection for sleep apnea.

**Military Service:**
I served in the [Branch] from [dates] with MOS/Rating [XXX].

**[CHOOSE ONE OR BOTH SECTIONS BELOW]**

**For Direct Service Connection:**
During my service, I experienced symptoms consistent with sleep apnea, including:
- Extreme fatigue and daytime sleepiness
- Loud snoring (my roommates/bunkmates complained)
- Waking up gasping or choking
- Never feeling rested despite sleeping

[If you have buddy statements:]
My bunkmates and fellow service members witnessed my snoring and breathing problems during sleep. [Name(s)] can attest to this in their statements.

I was not tested for sleep apnea during service because [sleep studies weren't readily available/I didn't know it was a medical condition/etc.]. However, I was experiencing symptoms throughout my service from [approximate date].

**For Secondary Service Connection:**
My sleep apnea is secondary to my service-connected [condition]. Here is how they are connected:

[Example for PTSD:]
My service-connected PTSD has caused significant sleep disturbance since [date]. Medical research shows that PTSD increases the risk of developing sleep apnea through mechanisms including increased sympathetic nervous system activity, upper airway changes, and sleep fragmentation. My PTSD symptoms [describe how they affect sleep].

[Example for weight gain from orthopedic conditions:]
Since being service-connected for [knee/back/etc.], I have been unable to exercise due to pain and limitations. As a result, I gained approximately [X] pounds. This weight gain directly contributed to my developing sleep apnea, which is strongly correlated with obesity.

**Current Condition:**
I was diagnosed with sleep apnea on [date] via [sleep study type]. My AHI was [number], indicating [mild/moderate/severe] sleep apnea.

I was prescribed a CPAP machine on [date] and use it [every night/as prescribed]. Without the CPAP, I experience [describe symptoms: excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, witnessed apneas, morning headaches, etc.].

**Impact on Daily Life:**
My sleep apnea affects my life in the following ways:
- Daytime functioning: [describe fatigue, sleepiness, difficulty concentrating]
- Work impact: [describe any job-related issues]
- Travel: [difficulty traveling with CPAP, explaining equipment]
- Quality of life: [how it affects your day-to-day]

I certify that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

[Signature]
[Date]

## Buddy Statement Tips for Sleep Apnea

**For fellow service members (critical for direct claims):**
- Describe snoring, gasping, or breathing problems you witnessed
- Note daytime fatigue or sleepiness you observed
- State the timeframe (during service)
- Be specific about where you lived together (barracks, tent, ship)

**For spouse/family:**
- Describe snoring history (going back as far as possible)
- Witnessed breathing stops during sleep
- Daytime sleepiness and fatigue
- Changes since CPAP use

**Example for fellow service member:**
"I served with [Veteran's Name] in [Unit] from [dates]. We shared [barracks/berthing/tent/etc.]. I personally witnessed [Veteran's Name] snoring extremely loudly every night. On multiple occasions, I noticed they would stop breathing during sleep and then gasp or choke. They frequently complained of being tired despite sleeping a full night. Other members of our [unit/section/etc.] also complained about the snoring. This was a consistent pattern throughout our time together during [timeframe]."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** Errors in weighing evidence or clear procedural mistakes
**When to use:** If positive evidence was ignored

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Adding nexus evidence
**What to submit:**
- Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) with positive nexus
- Additional buddy statements
- Medical literature supporting secondary connection
- New sleep study if previous one was inadequate

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex nexus disputes
**When to use:** When nexus is the central issue and you have strong supporting evidence

**Sleep apnea-specific appeal tips:**
- IMOs are often necessary and worth the investment ($1,000-3,000)
- Focus on the physiological mechanism connecting conditions
- Cite peer-reviewed medical literature
- Challenge negative nexus opinions that don't consider all evidence
- If claiming secondary, ensure examiner properly evaluated the connection

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a diagnosis from during service?
No. Most veterans weren't tested for sleep apnea during service because sleep studies weren't routinely done. You can establish service connection through secondary connection or by documenting in-service symptoms.

### What AHI score do I need?
An AHI of 5+ confirms obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis. However, the severity (mild/moderate/severe) doesn't affect VA rating—only treatment requirements matter.

### What if I can't tolerate CPAP?
If you were prescribed CPAP but can't tolerate it, you may still qualify for 50% based on the prescription. Document your attempts to use it and the reasons you couldn't.

### Can I claim sleep apnea secondary to PTSD?
Yes. Multiple studies show a strong correlation between PTSD and sleep apnea. This is one of the strongest secondary claim arguments.

### What if I was diagnosed with sleep apnea years after service?
Many veterans develop sleep apnea later or aren't diagnosed until later. Focus on secondary connection or documenting in-service symptoms (via buddy statements).

### Does weight gain affect my claim?
If your weight gain resulted from a service-connected condition (can't exercise due to orthopedic issues, medication side effects), this supports secondary connection. If weight gain is unrelated to service, it may complicate your claim.

### Can I get TDIU based on sleep apnea?
Potentially. If your sleep apnea (with its fatigue and cognitive effects) prevents you from maintaining substantially gainful employment, you may qualify for TDIU.
