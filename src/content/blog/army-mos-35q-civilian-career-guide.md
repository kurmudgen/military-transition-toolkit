## Bottom Line Up Front

**Note: MOS 35Q was discontinued in 2020 and transitioned to 17C (Cyber Operations Specialist). However, former 35Qs who separated before the transition still have extremely valuable skills.**

Former Army 35Q Cryptologic Network Warfare Specialists—your offensive cyber operations training and clearance make you one of the most sought-after professionals in cybersecurity. Your **cyber network exploitation, offensive cyber operations, network attack techniques, defensive cyber operations, vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, malware analysis, and experience operating in classified cyber environments** make you extremely valuable to government agencies and private sector cybersecurity companies. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$100,000-$140,000** with NSA, USCYBERCOM, or top-tier cybersecurity firms, scaling to **$140,000-$180,000** with mid-career positions, and **$180,000-$250,000+** for senior offensive security roles or cybersecurity leadership. Your TS/SCI clearance plus offensive cyber experience is worth **$30,000-$50,000** in salary premium.

As a 35Q, you didn't just "do cybersecurity." You conducted offensive cyber operations against adversary networks. You identified vulnerabilities in enemy systems and exploited them. You developed custom tools and exploits. You conducted cyber reconnaissance and network mapping. You operated in classified environments conducting Computer Network Operations (CNO). You defended friendly networks while attacking adversary systems. That's offensive security, penetration testing, exploit development, and cyber warfare—the rarest and most valuable cybersecurity skills.

The critical advantage: 35Q/17C training is the military equivalent of elite offensive security certifications and years of hands-on hacking experience. Companies pay $150K-$250K+ for penetration testers and red team operators with your skills. NSA and USCYBERCOM desperately need offensive cyber operators. You've conducted real-world cyber operations—that's worth a fortune in the civilian cybersecurity market.

## What Does a 35Q Cryptologic Network Warfare Specialist Do?

As a 35Q, you conducted Computer Network Operations (CNO) including network attack, exploitation, and defense. You identified vulnerabilities in target networks through reconnaissance and analysis. You developed and employed custom tools, scripts, and exploits to gain access to adversary networks. You conducted network mapping, vulnerability assessment, and target analysis. You extracted intelligence from compromised systems while maintaining operational security. You defended friendly networks from cyber attacks while conducting offensive operations against adversary systems.

Your responsibilities included planning and executing offensive cyber operations, conducting cyber reconnaissance and target development, analyzing network traffic and system logs, developing custom exploitation tools, maintaining access to compromised networks, producing intelligence from cyber operations, collaborating with signals intelligence and other disciplines, and maintaining strict operational security. You worked in highly classified environments with cutting-edge offensive cyber tools and techniques.

This role required deep technical knowledge of networking protocols, operating systems (Windows, Linux, Unix), programming and scripting (Python, PowerShell, bash), exploitation techniques, malware analysis, penetration testing methodologies, critical thinking and creative problem-solving, and TS/SCI clearance with access to the most sensitive cyber operations.
