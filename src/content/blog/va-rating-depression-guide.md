# VA Rating for Depression: How to Get the Rating You Deserve (2025)

Depression affects millions of veterans, yet many don't realize they can receive VA disability compensation for it. If your depression is connected to your military service—whether directly or through another service-connected condition—you may be entitled to monthly compensation ranging from $175.51 to $3,906.04.

This guide breaks down exactly how to get the depression rating you deserve.

## How the VA Rates Depression

Depression is rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (38 CFR § 4.130). The VA doesn't care about your specific diagnosis (Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, etc.)—they care about how your symptoms affect your ability to function.

### Depression Rating Schedule

| Rating | Monthly Pay (2025) | Key Indicators |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **0%** | $0 | Diagnosed but symptoms don't require continuous medication or affect functioning |
| **10%** | $175.51 | Mild symptoms with slight occupational impairment during stress |
| **30%** | $524.31 | Occupational impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency |
| **50%** | $1,110.55 | Reduced reliability; difficulty maintaining work and social relationships |
| **70%** | $1,716.28 | Deficiencies in most areas; severe occupational and social impairment |
| **100%** | $3,906.04 | Total occupational and social impairment |

### What Each Rating Looks Like in Real Life

**10% Rating** - "Mild Depression"
- You feel down sometimes but can still function
- Work performance drops slightly during stressful periods
- You can maintain relationships, though with effort
- Symptoms controlled by medication

**30% Rating** - "Moderate Depression"
- Episodes where you can't perform as well at work
- Chronic sleep problems
- Mild memory issues
- Depressed mood affecting motivation
- Weekly panic attacks or anxiety episodes
- You manage daily life but it's harder than it should be

**50% Rating** - "Moderate-Severe Depression"
- You're unreliable at work due to symptoms
- Flat emotional responses
- Trouble understanding complex instructions
- Short-term memory problems
- Impaired judgment
- Significant difficulty making and keeping friends
- Panic attacks more than once a week
- You can work but struggle to maintain employment

**70% Rating** - "Severe Depression"
- Problems in most areas of life
- Suicidal thoughts (even without plans)
- Can't adapt to stressful situations
- Near-constant depression affecting all functioning
- Periods of violence or unprovoked irritability
- Difficulty with personal hygiene
- Can't maintain relationships
- May have periods where you can't work

**100% Rating** - "Total Impairment"
- Can't work at all due to depression
- Can't maintain personal hygiene
- Disoriented (confusion about time/place)
- Memory loss (forgetting family names, your own occupation)
- Danger to yourself
- Complete social isolation
- Persistent delusions or hallucinations

## Proving Service Connection

You need to prove your depression is connected to military service. There are several ways to do this.

### Direct Service Connection

Your depression began during or was caused by military service.

**Evidence needed:**
1. **Current diagnosis** of depression from qualified provider
2. **In-service evidence** of depression symptoms or treatment:
   - Mental health visits during service
   - Prescription for antidepressants while serving
   - Documentation of stressors (combat, MST, loss of fellow service members)
   - Performance issues related to mental health
3. **Nexus opinion** connecting current depression to in-service events

**What if your records don't show depression?**
Many service members didn't seek mental health treatment due to stigma. Use:
- Buddy statements describing mood changes during service
- Personal statement explaining why you didn't seek treatment
- Documentation of in-service stressors
- Evidence of personality/behavior changes noted by others

### Secondary Service Connection

Your depression was caused or worsened by another service-connected condition. **This is the most common successful path for depression claims.**

**Common secondary connections:**

**Chronic Pain → Depression**
- Back pain, knee injuries, migraines that cause chronic suffering
- Studies show 30-50% of chronic pain patients develop depression
- The mechanism is straightforward: constant pain leads to depression

**PTSD → Depression**
- Depression is extremely common alongside PTSD
- Many veterans have both diagnosed
- VA should rate all mental health symptoms together

**Sleep Apnea → Depression**
- Chronic sleep deprivation causes depression
- Well-documented medical connection

**TBI → Depression**
- Brain injuries frequently cause depression
- Neurological changes affect mood regulation

**Tinnitus → Depression**
- Constant ringing leads to frustration, sleep problems, and depression
- Often underestimated connection

**Erectile Dysfunction → Depression**
- ED significantly impacts mental health and relationships
- Often overlooked secondary claim

**Any Chronic Illness → Depression**
- Cancer, diabetes, heart disease
- Living with chronic illness commonly causes depression

### Filing Secondary Claims

If you're already service-connected for a condition that's causing depression:

1. File depression as "secondary to [your condition]"
2. Get nexus letter explaining the connection
3. Provide medical literature supporting the link
4. Document how the primary condition affects your mood

## The Importance of Buddy Statements

For depression claims, buddy statements can make or break your case. The VA examiner may spend 30-60 minutes with you—your spouse has lived with you for years.

### Who Should Write Statements

- **Spouse/partner** - Sees your daily struggles
- **Adult children** - Can describe changes they've witnessed
- **Close friends** - Known you before and after service
- **Coworkers** - Can speak to occupational impairment
- **Fellow veterans** - Served with you and witnessed changes

### What Buddy Statements Should Include

**Changes since service:**
"Before his deployment, [veteran] was outgoing and positive. Since returning, he barely leaves the house, has lost interest in hobbies he loved, and struggles to engage with our children."

**Specific examples:**
"Last month, he didn't get out of bed for three days. He called in sick to work because he couldn't face going in."

**Impact on relationships:**
"Our marriage has suffered significantly. He's emotionally distant and we no longer do activities together that we used to enjoy."

**Comparison to before:**
"When I met him in 2010, he was full of energy and always planning our next adventure. Now he just sits in the dark and watches TV."

## C&P Exam Preparation

The mental health C&P exam determines your rating. Prepare thoroughly.

### What Happens During the Exam

The examiner will:
1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about your history and symptoms
3. Assess your current mental state
4. Determine severity of impairment
5. Provide opinion on service connection

### Questions You'll Be Asked

**History questions:**
- When did your depression start?
- What treatment have you received?
- Have you been hospitalized?
- What medications do you take?

**Symptom questions:**
- How often do you feel depressed?
- Have you had suicidal thoughts?
- How is your sleep?
- What's your energy level like?
- Do you have trouble concentrating?
- Have you lost interest in activities?
- How is your appetite?

**Functioning questions:**
- How does depression affect your work?
- Can you maintain relationships?
- Do you have friends?
- What does a typical day look like?
- Do you take care of your hygiene?
- Can you handle finances and chores?

### How to Respond

**Be honest about your worst days.** The examiner needs to understand your impairment level. If you have days where you can't get out of bed, say so.

**Give specific examples.** Instead of "I feel sad," say "Last week I cried three times and couldn't go to work Tuesday because I couldn't face people."

**Don't put on a brave face.** This isn't a job interview. You don't get points for seeming okay.

**Describe the full picture.** If you've had suicidal thoughts, disclose them. If you've been violent, mention it. The examiner needs all information.

**Explain the connection to service.** For secondary claims: "My chronic back pain keeps me from doing anything I enjoy, and that's made me depressed."

### What to Bring

- List of all mental health providers
- Current medications and dosages
- Written notes on your symptoms and their frequency
- Specific examples of recent bad days/episodes
- Any hospitalizations or crisis events
- Buddy statements (if not already submitted)

## Increasing Your Depression Rating

If you're rated for depression but your condition has worsened, file for an increase.

### Signs You Should File for Increase

- Symptoms have gotten worse since last rating
- You've been hospitalized
- Medication changes or increased dosages
- Lost a job due to depression
- Relationships have ended
- New symptoms have developed
- You've had suicidal ideation

### How to File

1. File VA Form 21-526EZ for increase
2. Submit recent medical evidence (within 12 months)
3. Provide new buddy statements describing worsening
4. Write personal statement explaining changes
5. Attend new C&P exam

## Common Mistakes That Hurt Your Claim

### 1. No Current Treatment
If you're not receiving treatment for depression, the VA may question the severity. Get consistent mental health care before filing.

### 2. Minimizing Symptoms at C&P Exam
Veterans often downplay struggles. The examiner only knows what you tell them—describe your actual impairment.

### 3. No Buddy Statements
Your word alone is less powerful than multiple corroborating statements. Get 2-3 statements minimum.

### 4. Weak Nexus for Secondary Claims
If filing secondary, you need clear medical opinion explaining the connection. Don't assume the VA will figure it out.

### 5. Inconsistent Records
If you tell the examiner you can't work but records show you're working full-time, there's a credibility problem. Be honest and consistent.

### 6. Not Appealing Denials
Depression claims are often denied initially. Don't give up—submit supplemental evidence and try again.

## Secondary Conditions FROM Depression

If you're service-connected for depression, these may be secondary TO it:

**Sleep disorders** - Depression commonly causes insomnia
**Weight changes** - Depression affects appetite and metabolism
**Substance abuse** - Self-medicating depression
**Erectile dysfunction** - Depression and antidepressants both cause ED
**Cognitive disorder** - Severe depression affects memory and concentration
**Hypertension** - Chronic stress contributes to high blood pressure

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I be rated for depression and PTSD?
No. The VA only provides one mental health rating. Your rating will cover all mental health symptoms.

### What if I wasn't diagnosed with depression until after service?
You can still claim if you can connect it to service through secondary connection or show symptoms existed in service but weren't diagnosed.

### Do I need to be in treatment to claim depression?
Having current treatment strengthens your claim, but it's not absolutely required. However, lack of treatment may result in lower rating.

### How long does a depression claim take?
4-8 months typically. Mental health claims sometimes take longer.

### What's the average rating for depression?
Most veterans receive 30-50%. Higher ratings require significant documentation of severe impairment.

### Can depression by itself get me to 100%?
Yes, if your symptoms are severe enough to cause total occupational and social impairment. This typically requires hospitalization history and clear inability to work.
