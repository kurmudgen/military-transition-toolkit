# VA Disability Rating for Military Sexual Trauma (MST): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Military Sexual Trauma (MST) itself is not rated—rather, the **mental and physical conditions resulting from MST** are rated. PTSD from MST is most commonly rated under **Diagnostic Code 9411** at **30-100%**. The VA has **special evidence rules for MST claims** recognizing that sexual assault/harassment often goes unreported. You do NOT need to prove the assault happened—the VA uses "markers" and circumstantial evidence. If you experienced MST and have resulting conditions, you deserve benefits regardless of whether you reported the assault during service. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Military Sexual Trauma?

Military Sexual Trauma (MST) is the VA's term for sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment that occurred during military service. It includes:

**Sexual assault:**
- Rape
- Sexual battery
- Unwanted sexual contact
- Forced sexual acts

**Sexual harassment:**
- Repeated unwelcome sexual advances
- Threatening sexual comments
- Sexual coercion
- Hostile work environment based on gender/sexuality

**Important:** MST can happen to anyone of any gender. Both men and women experience MST, and VA provides services and benefits for all survivors.

## Conditions Rated from MST

MST causes various conditions that are rated under their respective diagnostic codes:

### PTSD (Most Common) - DC 9411
Rating: 0-100% using General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders

### Major Depressive Disorder - DC 9434
Rating: 0-100%

### Anxiety Disorders - DC 9400
Rating: 0-100%

### Eating Disorders - DC 9520-9521
Rating: 0-100%

### Other Mental Health Conditions
Various diagnostic codes, 0-100%

### Physical Conditions from MST
- Chronic pain conditions
- Gynecological/urological problems
- Sexually transmitted infections
- Injuries from assault

## VA Rating Criteria

Conditions from MST are rated using the same criteria as those conditions from other causes. For PTSD and mental health conditions, ratings are:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Diagnosed but minimal impairment |
| **10%** | Mild symptoms during significant stress OR controlled by medication |
| **30%** | Occasional decrease in work efficiency, symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, sleep impairment |
| **50%** | Reduced reliability and productivity, difficulty with relationships |
| **70%** | Deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood) |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment |

## Special Evidence Rules for MST Claims

**The VA recognizes that MST often goes unreported.** Under 38 CFR § 3.304(f)(5), the VA uses relaxed evidence standards for MST claims.

### You Do NOT Need:
- A military police report
- Court-martial records
- Official investigation documentation
- Witnesses to the assault
- Service treatment records mentioning assault

### Evidence the VA Accepts ("Markers"):

**Behavioral changes after the incident:**
- Request for transfer to another unit
- Sudden request to change MOS or duty station
- Unexplained leave requests
- Changes in performance evaluations (decline)
- Increased absences or tardiness
- Disciplinary problems that didn't exist before
- Substance abuse beginning after incident

**Medical/psychological markers:**
- STI testing
- Pregnancy testing
- Mental health visits (even for unrelated complaints)
- Physical symptoms (gynecological, gastrointestinal)
- Emergency room visits
- Counseling (chaplain, MFLC)

**Personal markers:**
- Relationship problems or divorce
- Changes in behavior noted in letters/journals
- Academic/training performance changes
- Discharge type changes
- Separation from service

### Types of Evidence to Submit

1. **Personal statement** describing the MST and resulting symptoms
2. **Buddy statements** from:
   - Fellow service members who noticed behavior changes
   - Family/friends who noticed changes
   - Anyone who was told about the assault
3. **Service records showing markers**
4. **Medical records** showing treatment for related conditions
5. **Post-service treatment records**

## C&P Exam for MST-Related Conditions

The VA will schedule a C&P exam for your claimed condition (usually PTSD).

**Important provisions:**
- You may request an examiner of a specific gender
- You may bring a support person
- The examiner should be trained in MST-related claims

**What the examiner will do:**
1. Ask about the MST stressor event
2. Assess current symptoms
3. Evaluate functional impairment
4. Provide nexus opinion

**What to expect:**
- You will need to discuss the assault to some degree
- Focus on how it has affected you
- Be honest about symptoms and impairment
- You don't have to provide graphic details

**Tips for the exam:**
- It's okay to be emotional
- Take breaks if needed
- Focus on how the event affected your life
- Describe all resulting symptoms
- Don't minimize your impairment

## Frequently Asked Questions

No. The VA uses a "markers" standard. Circumstantial evidence and behavioral changes can establish that MST occurred.

### Can men file MST claims?
Absolutely. MST affects all genders. The VA provides MST services for all veterans regardless of gender.

### What if I was drinking when the assault occurred?
This does not affect your claim. Consent cannot be given while intoxicated.

### What if the perpetrator was a superior officer?
This is unfortunately common and doesn't affect your claim eligibility.

### Can I get MST-related care without filing a claim?
Yes. Any veteran can receive free mental and physical health care related to MST, regardless of discharge type or claim status.

### What if I can't talk about what happened?
