# California Veterans: Healthcare Facilities, Education Benefits & Job Resources

California is home to 1.6-1.8 million veterans - more than any other state in America. That's roughly 8-9% of the nation's entire veteran population living in one state.

With that population comes extensive infrastructure: world-class VA medical centers, elite universities with veteran programs, and major defense contractors actively recruiting military talent. But California's high cost of living and housing crisis create real challenges for veterans trying to build civilian lives here.

This guide provides actual addresses, phone numbers, and actionable information for California veterans navigating healthcare, education, and employment.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Healthcare**: California has 9 VA medical centers, 50+ community-based clinics, and 8 state veterans homes - more VA infrastructure than most countries' entire healthcare systems

**Education**: CalVet College Fee Waiver for dependents of disabled veterans, 148 schools with in-state tuition for GI Bill users, strong Yellow Ribbon participation

**Employment**: State hiring preference, massive defense contractor presence (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing), but fierce competition for jobs

**Veteran Population Hotspots**: Los Angeles County (310,000+), San Diego County (235,000+), Riverside County (165,000+), Orange County (120,000+)

**Biggest challenge**: 1 in 3 homeless veterans in America lives in California - housing affordability is the critical issue
