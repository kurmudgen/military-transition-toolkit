# Delaware Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Delaware may be the second-smallest state in America, but it punches above its weight for veterans in one critical way: **zero sales tax**. Combined with some of the lowest property tax rates in the nation and growing military retirement tax relief, Delaware offers a unique value proposition for veterans—especially those willing to live in a small state with big neighbors.

Here's what you need to know about Delaware's veteran tax benefits, property tax exemptions, and whether "The First State" makes financial sense for your retirement.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Delaware offers veterans in 2025:

- **Sales tax**: ZERO - Delaware is one of only five states with no sales tax
- **Property tax**: Full exemption for 100% disabled veterans; $5,000 assessed value deduction for 10%+ disabled
- **School tax credit**: 100% of non-vocational school district property tax for 100% P&T disabled veterans
- **Military retirement pay**: $12,500 exempt (age 60+), $2,000 exempt (under 60) - **legislation pending to increase to $25,000 for all ages**
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Property tax rate**: 0.43-0.55% average (one of the lowest in America)

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $3,000-$6,000+ depending on property value and location.

**The Delaware advantage**: No sales tax means every purchase saves you 6-10% compared to neighboring states. Property taxes are a fraction of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Maryland. For veterans who want Mid-Atlantic location without Mid-Atlantic costs, Delaware delivers.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Current Law and Pending Changes

Delaware currently offers a limited military retirement exemption, but that's changing.

**Current law (2025)**:
- **Age 60 and older**: Exclude up to $12,500 of military retirement pay
- **Under age 60**: Exclude up to $2,000 of military retirement pay
- This is part of Delaware's general pension exclusion

**The math (current law)**: At Delaware's top tax rate of 6.6%, exempting $12,500 saves approximately $825/year for retirees over 60.

### Pending Legislation - Significant Improvements Coming

Multiple bills are working through Delaware's legislature to dramatically improve military retirement tax treatment:

**Senate Bill 188** (most favorable):
- **100% exemption** for military retirement pay starting tax year 2025
- No age restrictions
- No income limits
- Would make Delaware fully competitive with tax-free states

**Alternative phased approach**:
- Increases exemption from $12,500 to $25,000 over 3 years
- Removes age requirement (same $25,000 for all ages)
- Full phase-in by tax year 2026

**Status**: Bipartisan support, pending final legislative action.

**What this means**: If you're planning a move to Delaware in 2025-2026, monitor these bills. Passage of full exemption would save military retirees $1,200-$2,400+ annually depending on retirement pay amount.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation remains exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $171/month for a 10% rating or $3,946/month for 100% with dependents (2025 rates), you won't pay taxes on it.

### State Income Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Delaware operates on a graduated income tax system with moderate rates:

- 0% on taxable income up to $2,000
- 2.2% on income from $2,001 to $5,000
- 3.9% on income from $5,001 to $10,000
- 4.8% on income from $10,001 to $20,000
- 5.2% on income from $20,001 to $25,000
- 5.55% on income from $25,001 to $60,000
- 6.6% on income over $60,000

Most military retirees fall into the 5.2-6.6% brackets—significantly lower than neighboring states.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Top Income Tax Rate | Sales Tax | Property Tax (avg) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Delaware** | $12,500 exempt (pending increase) | 6.6% | 0% | 0.43-0.55% |
| Pennsylvania | Full exemption | 3.07% flat | 6-8% | 1.36% |
| New Jersey | Partial (based on income) | 10.75% | 6.625% | 2.26% |
| Maryland | Up to $5,000 (phase-out) | 5.75% | 6% | 1.09% |
| Virginia | Subtraction for 55+ | 5.75% | 5.3% | 0.80% |

**Delaware's sweet spot**: While Pennsylvania has full military retirement exemption, Delaware crushes it on property taxes and sales tax. Compared to New Jersey, Delaware saves veterans thousands annually on property taxes alone.

## Property Tax Exemptions for Veterans

### 100% Disabled Veterans - Full Exemption

If you're rated 100% Permanent and Total (P&T) by the VA, you qualify for Delaware's full property tax exemption.

**What you get**:
- **Exemption equal to full assessed value** of your primary residence
- Eliminates county property taxes entirely
- Available to 100% P&T disabled veterans or those receiving 100% due to individual unemployability (TDIU)
- Also available to veterans with quadriplegia or specific mobility impairments

**Eligibility**:
- 100% service-connected permanent and total disability
- OR 100% disability compensation due to individual unemployability
- Must have lived in Delaware for past 3 years
- Property must be your primary residence

#### Real-World Examples

**New Castle County (Wilmington area, 0.76% rate)**
- Home value: $350,000
- Assessed value: $350,000
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $2,660
- **Annual tax with 100% exemption**: $0
- **Annual savings: $2,660**

**Kent County (Dover area, 0.40% rate)**
- Home value: $300,000
- Assessed value: $300,000
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $1,200
- **Annual tax with 100% exemption**: $0
- **Annual savings: $1,200**

**Sussex County (beach areas, 0.33% rate)**
- Home value: $450,000
- Assessed value: $450,000
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $1,485
- **Annual tax with 100% exemption**: $0
- **Annual savings: $1,485**

### Partial Disability Ratings (10%-90%)

Veterans with disability ratings between 10% and 90% receive a more modest benefit:

**What you get**:
- **$5,000 deduction** from assessed property value
- Available for veterans with 10% or higher VA disability rating
- Applies to primary residence only

#### Examples for Partial Disability

**Wilmington home ($350,000, 0.76% rate)**
- Assessed value: $350,000
- Less $5,000 deduction: $345,000
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $2,660
- **Annual tax with $5,000 deduction**: $2,622
- **Annual savings: $38**

**Dover home ($300,000, 0.40% rate)**
- Assessed value: $300,000
- Less $5,000 deduction: $295,000
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $1,200
- **Annual tax with $5,000 deduction**: $1,180
- **Annual savings: $20**

**Reality check**: The $5,000 deduction provides minimal savings for partial disability ratings. Delaware's major property tax benefit targets 100% disabled veterans.

### Disabled Veterans School Property Tax Credit

This is Delaware's newest and most significant benefit for disabled veterans, enacted in 2021.

**What you get**:
- **100% credit against non-vocational school district property tax**
- Applies to primary residence only
- Separate from the county property tax exemption (you can get both!)

**Eligibility**:
- 100% disability compensation due to service-connected permanent and total disability
- OR 100% disability rating based on individual unemployability
- Must have held legal domicile in Delaware for past 3 years
- Must pay property tax bill in full by end of each tax year to qualify for following year's credit

**Coverage**: All 16 Delaware non-vocational school districts participate

**Application deadline**: April 30th for upcoming tax year

#### How School Taxes Work in Delaware

In Delaware, property taxes are split between county, school district, and sometimes municipality:
- **County property tax**: Funds county government
- **School district tax**: Funds local schools (this is usually the larger portion)
- **Municipal tax**: Some cities add additional tax

**Example breakdown** (typical New Castle County home):
- County property tax: ~30% of total bill
- School district tax: ~60% of total bill
- Municipal tax: ~10% of total bill

#### Real-World School Tax Credit Examples

**Wilmington home ($350,000)**
- Total annual property tax: $2,660
- School district portion (60%): ~$1,596
- **School tax credit**: $1,596
- Combined with county exemption: Total savings $2,660 (100% P&T gets both benefits)

**Dover home ($300,000)**
- Total annual property tax: $1,200
- School district portion (60%): ~$720
- **School tax credit**: $720
- Combined with county exemption: Total savings $1,200 (100% P&T gets both benefits)

**Newark home ($390,000)**
- Total annual property tax: $2,964
- School district portion (60%): ~$1,778
- **School tax credit**: $1,778
- Combined with county exemption: Total savings $2,964 (100% P&T gets both benefits)

### Un-Remarried Surviving Spouses

Un-remarried surviving spouses of qualifying veterans may also claim the full property tax exemption and school tax credit if they meet eligibility criteria.

## The Zero Sales Tax Advantage

Delaware is one of only five states (along with Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon) with **no state or local sales tax**.

**What this means in practice**:

### Annual Savings vs. Neighboring States

**Family of four, typical annual spending**:
- Groceries: $12,000 (not taxed in most states, but Delaware still saves on prepared foods)
- Clothing/household goods: $5,000
- Electronics/appliances: $2,000
- Restaurants/entertainment: $6,000
- Vehicle purchase: $30,000 (one-time)
- **Total taxable purchases**: ~$55,000

**Sales tax comparison**:
- **Delaware**: $0
- Pennsylvania (6% average): $3,300
- New Jersey (6.625% average): $3,644
- Maryland (6% average): $3,300

**Annual savings**: $3,300-$3,644 per year vs. neighbors

**Major purchase savings**:
- $30,000 vehicle in Delaware: $30,000
- Same vehicle in New Jersey: $31,988 (6.625% tax)
- **Savings**: $1,988

### Shopping Destination

Delaware's no-sales-tax status makes it a shopping destination:
- **Christiana Mall** (Newark): One of America's largest malls, packed on weekends with Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland shoppers
- **Tanger Outlets** (Rehoboth Beach): Tax-free outlet shopping
- **Delaware retail corridor** (I-95): Major retailers cluster near borders

**Veteran benefit**: You save money just by living here, and every major purchase (vehicle, appliances, furniture, electronics) nets you 6-10% vs. neighboring states.

## Vehicle Registration Benefits

Delaware doesn't offer specific disabled veteran vehicle registration exemptions like some states, but registration fees are relatively modest:

- **Standard registration**: $40-60 annually (based on vehicle weight)
- **Disabled veteran license plates**: Available but don't reduce fees
- **Purple Heart plates**: Available
- **No vehicle property tax** (unlike Virginia or other states)

**Reality**: Delaware isn't competitive on vehicle registration benefits, but at least there's no annual vehicle property tax.

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the total 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran in Delaware.

### Scenario: E-7 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $32,000
- VA disability: $47,352 (100% with dependents, 2025 rate)
- Total: $79,352

**Home**: $350,000 (above Delaware median of $300,000)

### Delaware Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax exemption (100%) | $2,660 | $53,200 |
| School tax credit (100%) | Included above | Included above |
| Military retirement tax exemption (current) | $825 | $16,500 |
| Sales tax savings vs. neighbors | $3,300 | $66,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$6,785** | **$135,700** |

**If full military retirement exemption passes**:
- Additional annual savings: $1,287
- Additional 20-year savings: $25,740
- **New total**: $161,440 over 20 years

**Note**: This assumes:
- 0.76% New Castle County property tax rate
- Current military retirement exemption (conservative estimate)
- Sales tax comparison to 6% average neighboring state
- No increase in exemption amounts or home value (conservative)

### Cost of Living Reality Check

Delaware's cost of living is approximately **7-8% above the national average**, driven primarily by housing costs in northern Delaware (Wilmington area). However:

**Delaware advantages**:
- 0% sales tax (saves 6-10% on all purchases)
- Very low property taxes (0.43-0.55% vs. 1%+ in most states)
- Lower than New Jersey, Maryland urban areas
- No vehicle property tax
- Moderate income tax rates

**Delaware challenges**:
- Higher housing costs than Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina
- Small state limits geographic options
- Limited defense contractor presence

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the military retirement exemption be increased to $25,000 or 100%?

Multiple bills are pending with bipartisan support. Senate Bill 188 proposes 100% exemption starting tax year 2025. An alternative approach phases in $25,000 exemption over 3 years. Both have strong veteran community backing, but passage isn't guaranteed. Contact your state legislators to express support.

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?

No for the county property tax exemption (one-time application). **Yes for the school tax credit** (annual application by April 30th with income verification).

### Can I get both the county property tax exemption AND the school tax credit?

Yes! If you're 100% P&T disabled, you qualify for both:
- County property tax exemption (eliminates county portion)
- School tax credit (eliminates school district portion)
- Together, these eliminate your entire property tax bill

### What if I'm rated 70% disabled?

You'd receive the $5,000 assessed value deduction (saves $20-38/year depending on location and tax rate). Delaware's major benefits target 100% disabled veterans. The partial disability deduction provides minimal savings.

### I'm 100% P&T but don't have 3 years Delaware residency yet. Can I apply?

Not immediately. You must establish legal domicile in Delaware for 3 years before qualifying for the 100% disabled veteran property tax exemption and school tax credit. Apply as soon as you hit the 3-year mark.

### Does the property tax exemption reduce my home's market value?

No. It only reduces or eliminates property taxes. Your home's actual market value and your equity remain unchanged.

### Can I use the exemption on a second home or rental property?

No. Both the property tax exemption and school tax credit apply only to your primary residence.

### What counts as "100% disabled" for these benefits?

Either of these qualifies:
- 100% Permanent & Total (P&T) rating
- 100% schedular rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU)

### What if my county denies my exemption application?

You have the right to appeal:
1. Request written explanation from county assessment office
2. Contact Delaware Office of Veterans Services: (302) 739-2792 or (800) 344-9900
3. File formal appeal with county if necessary

### Are there property tax benefits for seniors (non-veterans)?

Yes. Delaware offers seniors (65+) a property tax credit of up to $500 against school property taxes. However, you cannot claim both the senior credit and the disabled veteran school tax credit—choose whichever provides greater benefit. For 100% disabled veterans, the disabled veteran credit is almost always more valuable.

### Does Delaware tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, at normal income tax rates (up to 6.6%). However, Delaware's pension exclusion allows retirees age 60+ to exclude up to $12,500 of pension/retirement income—this can apply to TSP, 401(k), IRA, or military retirement (you choose which income source to apply it to for maximum benefit).

### I'm stationed in Delaware but claim residency in another state. Can I get these benefits?

No. These are Delaware resident benefits only. If you maintain legal residency in another state (as many active-duty members do), you won't qualify. However, if Delaware offers better tax treatment, you might consider establishing Delaware residency before separation.

### How does Delaware compare to Florida or Texas for military retirees?

**Florida/Texas advantages**:
- No state income tax at all (vs. Delaware's 6.6% top rate)
- Generally lower housing costs (except South Florida/Austin)
- Larger states with more geographic variety

**Delaware advantages**:
- No sales tax (saves thousands annually)
- Much lower property taxes than Texas (Texas averages 1.6% vs. Delaware's 0.43-0.55%)
- Mid-Atlantic location (3 hours to NYC, DC, Philadelphia)
- Beach access
- Small state means short commutes

**Bottom line**: Florida/Texas save more on income tax; Delaware saves more on sales tax and property taxes. If you have significant military retirement income, Florida/Texas may save more. If you're 100% disabled and don't have much taxable income, Delaware's property tax benefits shine.

### Can I claim the disabled veteran exemption if I own property jointly with my spouse?

Yes, as long as it's your primary residence and you meet eligibility requirements.

### What happens to the exemption if I die? Can my spouse keep it?

Un-remarried surviving spouses may continue to claim the exemption if they meet specific criteria. Contact your county assessment office for details on surviving spouse benefits.

## Cost of Living Considerations

Before moving to Delaware for veteran benefits, understand the cost reality.

### Housing Costs (Median Home Prices, 2025)

- **Wilmington**: $295,000-$327,000
- **Newark**: $365,000-$390,000 (University of Delaware area, higher prices)
- **Dover**: $262,000-$335,000
- **Middletown**: $407,000-$520,000 (fastest growing area)
- **Lewes**: ~$400,000-$600,000 (beach town)
- **Rehoboth Beach**: $1,000,000+ (beach resort, very expensive)
- **Georgetown**: $280,000-$320,000 (Sussex County seat, more affordable)

**State median**: ~$300,000-$350,000

### Overall Cost of Living

Delaware's cost of living is 0-8% higher than national average (sources vary):
- **Housing**: 7% lower than national average (but higher than many veteran-friendly states)
- **Utilities**: 3.5% below national average
- **Transportation**: Above national average
- **Groceries**: Near national average
- **Healthcare**: Near national average

### Geographic Cost Variations

**Expensive Delaware**:
- Northern New Castle County (Wilmington suburbs): Highest costs, closest to Philadelphia
- Newark: University town pricing
- Beach communities: Resort pricing, especially Rehoboth Beach

**Affordable Delaware**:
- Dover and Kent County: State capital, moderate costs
- Georgetown and western Sussex County: Most affordable
- Milford, Smyrna, Seaford: Small towns, lower costs

**Sweet spot for veterans**: Dover area and western Sussex County offer best combination of affordability, VA access, and Delaware tax benefits.

### Tax Burden Beyond Income Tax

- **Sales tax**: 0% (huge win)
- **Property tax**: 0.43-0.55% effective (very low)
- **Gas tax**: $0.23 per gallon (below national average)
- **Vehicle registration**: $40-60 annually (moderate)

### Where Delaware Veteran Benefits Make the Most Sense

**Delaware works well if**:
- You're 100% disabled (full property tax exemption + school tax credit = massive savings)
- You want Mid-Atlantic location (access to NYC, Philadelphia, DC, Baltimore)
- You make frequent major purchases (no sales tax saves thousands)
- You prefer small state, short commutes, beach access
- You work in Philadelphia or Baltimore (Delaware residence = lower taxes)

**Consider other states if**:
- You have substantial military retirement income and aren't disabled (Florida/Texas save more on income tax)
- You need strong military community (Delaware is small; go to Virginia or North Carolina)
- You want defense contractor jobs (limited in Delaware; go to DC area, Virginia)
- You need geographic space (Delaware is tiny—96 miles north to south)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Zero sales tax is Delaware's secret weapon** - Saves $3,000-$4,000 annually vs. neighboring states, every year, for life

2. **100% disabled veterans get exceptional property tax benefits** - Full exemption + school tax credit can eliminate $2,000-$5,000+ annual property taxes

3. **Military retirement tax relief is improving** - Current $12,500 exemption likely expanding to $25,000 or full exemption soon

4. **Delaware property taxes are remarkably low** - At 0.43-0.55%, you pay a fraction of New Jersey (2.26%), Pennsylvania (1.36%), or Texas (1.6%)

5. **Small state means limited options** - Delaware has only 3 counties and limited geographic diversity; it's not for everyone

6. **Perfect for disabled veterans who want Mid-Atlantic location** - Combine full property tax exemption, no sales tax, and proximity to major metros

7. **Dover area offers best value** - State capital, VA clinic, moderate housing costs, Dover AFB employment

8. **Monitor pending legislation** - Full military retirement exemption would make Delaware dramatically more competitive

9. **Three-year residency requirement** - Plan ahead; you can't claim major benefits immediately upon moving
