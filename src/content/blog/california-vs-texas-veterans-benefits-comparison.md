## Final Verdict

### Choose Texas if:

### Choose California if:
- You're in high-paying tech industry
- You want year-round mild weather
- You need world-class healthcare facilities
- You value Prop 13 property tax protection
- You prefer beach/outdoor lifestyle

**The Numbers:** Texas is objectively cheaper for most veterans. A military retiree saves approximately $13,000-$15,000 annually by choosing Texas, totaling $130,000+ over 10 years. However, California may be worth the premium for those in high-paying tech roles or with specific healthcare needs.

For most veterans on fixed military retirement income, **Texas represents the superior financial choice**. For high-earning tech professionals, California's salary premium may offset higher living costs.
