# Military TSP: How Much to Contribute and Which Funds to Choose (2025 Guide)

The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is one of the best retirement investment options in existence. Low fees, solid fund options, and tax advantages that civilian 401(k)s can only dream about.

But most junior troops don't contribute anything. And those who do often pick the wrong funds or contribute way too little.

Here's the problem: TSP is confusing if you're not into finance. The government doesn't explain it well during in-processing, and most first-term service members are more worried about surviving their first duty station than planning for retirement 40 years away.

I get it. But here's the reality: if you're 22 years old and you start contributing just $200/month to TSP right now, you'll have about $500,000 by age 60. If you wait until you're 32 to start, you'll only have about $250,000. That's a $250,000 difference for a 10-year delay.

This guide breaks down exactly how much to contribute, which funds to choose, Roth vs Traditional, and how to avoid the mistakes most service members make.

## TSP Basics: What It Actually Is

TSP is the military's version of a civilian 401(k). It's a retirement savings account where you contribute a portion of your paycheck, and that money gets invested in funds you choose.

**Key features:**
- **Pre-tax or Roth contributions** (you choose)
- **Investment options:** 5 individual funds + lifecycle funds
- **Low fees:** TSP fees are about 0.06% - civilian 401(k)s average 1% or more
- **Contribution limits:** $23,000 in 2025 ($30,500 if you're 50+)
- **Employer matching (BRS only):** Up to 5% if you're under Blended Retirement System

**Who manages it:** Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB)

**How to access it:** tsp.gov and the TSP mobile app

## BRS vs Legacy High-3: Which System Are You Under?

This matters because **BRS members get matching contributions, Legacy members do not**.

### Blended Retirement System (BRS)
- Enrolled if you joined after January 1, 2018
- OR if you joined before 2018 but opted into BRS during the opt-in period (2018)
- **Automatic 1% contribution from DOD** (even if you contribute $0)
- **Matching up to 5%** of your base pay

### Legacy High-3 System
- Enrolled if you joined before 2018 and didn't opt into BRS
- **No automatic contribution**
- **No matching contributions**
- **Only your voluntary contributions grow**

**How to check which system you're under:**
- Log in to myPay (mypay.dfas.mil)
- Check your LES (Leave and Earnings Statement)
- Look for "TSP" line items - if you see automatic 1% contributions you didn't set up, you're BRS

## How Much Should You Contribute?

The answer depends on your retirement system, age, and financial situation. Here are the recommendations:

### If You're Under BRS (Joined After 2018)

**Minimum Recommendation: 5%**

Contribute at least 5% to get the full DOD match. Here's how matching works:

- You contribute 0%: DOD contributes 1%
- You contribute 1%: DOD contributes 1% + matches 1% = 2% total
- You contribute 2%: DOD contributes 1% + matches 2% = 3% total
- You contribute 3%: DOD contributes 1% + matches 3.5% = 4.5% total
- You contribute 4%: DOD contributes 1% + matches 4% = 5% total
- **You contribute 5%: DOD contributes 1% + matches 5% = 6% total**
- You contribute 6%+: DOD still only contributes 6% total (capped at 5% match)

If you contribute 5%, you're getting an instant 20% return (6% from DOD on your 5% contribution). **Free money. Don't leave it on the table.**

**Ideal Recommendation: 10-15%**

If you can afford it, contribute 10-15% of your base pay. This sets you up for a solid retirement even if you don't serve 20 years.

**Aggressive Recommendation: 20%+**

If you're debt-free, living in the barracks, and have no dependents, max out your TSP contributions. The 2025 limit is $23,000/year (~$1,900/month). This is the fastest way to build wealth.

### If You're Under Legacy High-3 (Joined Before 2018)

**Minimum Recommendation: 5%**

Even without matching, 5% is a solid baseline. This gives you something growing beyond your pension.

**Ideal Recommendation: 10-15%**

Most financial advisors recommend 10-15% for retirement savings. Since you're not getting matching, you need to contribute more yourself.

**Aggressive Recommendation: Max it out**

If you're planning to serve 20+ years and get a pension, you might not need to max TSP. But if you're unsure about staying 20, contribute aggressively now.

### By Age and Rank

Here's a rough guide based on where you are in your career:

**E1-E4, Age 18-25:**
- Minimum: 5% (to get BRS match if applicable)
- Ideal: 10% if you can afford it
- **Why:** Compound interest over 40 years is insane. $100/month now = $100K+ at retirement.

**E5-E6, Age 25-35:**
- Minimum: 5-10%
- Ideal: 15%
- **Why:** You're earning more, likely past the "broke junior enlisted" phase. Time to get serious.

**E7+/Officers, Age 35+:**
- Minimum: 10%
- Ideal: 15-20%
- **Why:** You're in peak earning years. Max out retirement contributions now.

**Close to retirement (within 5-10 years):**
- Max it out if possible
- **Why:** Catch-up contributions (age 50+) allow $30,500/year. Use your higher pay to stockpile.

## Roth TSP vs Traditional TSP: Which Should You Choose?

TSP offers two contribution types:

### Traditional TSP (Pre-Tax)
- Contributions reduce your taxable income NOW
- Money grows tax-free
- You pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement

**Example:**
- Base pay: $3,000/month
- Contribute 10% Traditional TSP: $300/month
- Taxable income: $2,700/month (you saved taxes on $300)
- Taxes paid now: Lower
- Taxes paid in retirement: You'll pay income tax on withdrawals

### Roth TSP (After-Tax)
- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars (you already paid taxes)
- Money grows tax-free
- You pay ZERO taxes when you withdraw in retirement

**Example:**
- Base pay: $3,000/month
- Contribute 10% Roth TSP: $300/month
- Taxable income: $3,000/month (no tax reduction now)
- Taxes paid now: Normal
- Taxes paid in retirement: $0 (completely tax-free withdrawals)

### Which Should You Choose?

**Choose Roth TSP if:**
- You're junior enlisted (E1-E5) - your tax bracket is low now, will likely be higher in retirement
- You're young (under 35) - decades of tax-free growth
- You want tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- You expect your income to be higher in retirement (pension + TSP + Social Security + civilian job)

**Choose Traditional TSP if:**
- You're senior enlisted or officer - your tax bracket is high now
- You're close to retirement - less time for tax-free growth to matter
- You expect your income to be lower in retirement (no pension, or single income)

**For most military members: Choose Roth TSP.**

Here's why: most service members are in a low tax bracket during service (E1-E6 base pay is relatively low compared to civilian equivalents). In retirement, you'll likely have pension + TSP withdrawals + Social Security, which could put you in a higher bracket.

Paying taxes on contributions now (Roth) when you're in a low bracket = smart.
Paying taxes on withdrawals later (Traditional) when you're in a higher bracket = not smart.

**Pro tip:** You can split contributions. Do 75% Roth, 25% Traditional to diversify your tax exposure.

## TSP Funds: What to Actually Invest In

TSP offers 5 individual funds and several Lifecycle funds. Let's break down each option.

### The 5 Individual Funds

**G Fund (Government Securities)**
- Invests in special U.S. Treasury securities
- **Return:** Low (~2-3% per year)
- **Risk:** Zero risk to principal
- **Best for:** Money you need in the next 1-5 years, or extreme risk-averse investors

**Verdict:** Too conservative for long-term retirement. You're losing to inflation.

**F Fund (Fixed Income - Bonds)**
- Invests in U.S. bond market index
- **Return:** Moderate (~3-5% per year historically)
- **Risk:** Low to moderate (bonds can lose value when interest rates rise)
- **Best for:** Conservative investors or those near retirement

**Verdict:** Better than G Fund, but still too conservative for young investors.

**C Fund (Common Stocks - S&P 500)**
- Invests in S&P 500 (500 largest U.S. companies)
- **Return:** ~10% per year historically
- **Risk:** Moderate to high (stock market volatility)
- **Best for:** Long-term investors with 10+ years until retirement

**Verdict:** This is the backbone of most TSP portfolios. Solid choice.

**S Fund (Small Cap Stocks)**
- Invests in small and mid-sized U.S. companies
- **Return:** ~11% per year historically (higher than C Fund)
- **Risk:** Higher volatility than C Fund
- **Best for:** Aggressive investors seeking higher growth

**Verdict:** Great for diversification. Higher risk, higher reward.

**I Fund (International Stocks)**
- Invests in international developed markets (Europe, Asia, etc.)
- **Return:** ~6-8% per year historically
- **Risk:** Moderate to high (currency risk + stock volatility)
- **Best for:** Diversification outside the U.S.

**Verdict:** Good for diversification, but has underperformed U.S. stocks recently.

### Simple 3-Fund Portfolio (Most Popular)

If you don't want to overthink it, use this allocation:

**For investors under 40:**
- 60% C Fund (S&P 500)
- 20% S Fund (Small cap)
- 20% I Fund (International)
- 0% F Fund
- 0% G Fund

**For investors 40-50:**
- 50% C Fund
- 20% S Fund
- 20% I Fund
- 10% F Fund

**For investors 50+:**
- 40% C Fund
- 15% S Fund
- 15% I Fund
- 20% F Fund
- 10% G Fund

**Logic:** Younger investors can handle more stock volatility. Older investors need more stability as they approach retirement.

### Lifecycle Funds (L Funds) - Set-It-and-Forget-It Option

If you don't want to manage your own allocation, Lifecycle funds do it for you.

**How they work:**
- Pick a fund based on your expected retirement year
- The fund automatically shifts from aggressive (stocks) to conservative (bonds) as you age
- Rebalances automatically

**Available L Funds (2025):**
- **L 2070:** For those retiring around 2070 (born ~2005)
- **L 2065:** Retiring around 2065
- **L 2060:** Retiring around 2060
- **L 2055:** Retiring around 2055
- **L 2050:** Retiring around 2050
- **L 2045:** Retiring around 2045
- **L 2040:** Retiring around 2040
- **L 2035:** Retiring around 2035
- **L 2030:** Retiring around 2030
- **L Income:** Already retired, want stable income

**Allocation example (L 2065 fund):**
- 99% stocks (C, S, I Funds)
- 1% bonds (G, F Funds)

As you get closer to 2065, the fund automatically shifts to more bonds, less stocks.

**Pros:**
- Set it and forget it
- Automatic rebalancing
- Professionally managed allocation

**Cons:**
- Slightly higher fees (still cheap compared to civilian funds)
- Less control over allocation
- May be too conservative for some investors

**Verdict:** If you don't want to think about investing, pick the L Fund closest to your retirement year and call it done.

## Common TSP Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Mistake #1: Not contributing anything**
Even if you contribute just 5%, you're getting free money from BRS matching (if applicable) and decades of compound growth. Start now.

**Mistake #2: Leaving everything in the G Fund**
The G Fund is basically a savings account. You're losing to inflation. If you're under 50, you should be mostly in stock funds (C, S, I).

**Mistake #3: Not contributing enough to get the match**
If you're BRS and contributing less than 5%, you're literally refusing free money. Contribute at least 5%.

**Mistake #4: Stopping contributions during deployments**
Many service members stop TSP during deployments to increase take-home pay. Bad move. Deployment pay + CZTE = perfect time to max out TSP.

**Mistake #5: Cashing out when you separate**
If you leave the military before 20 years, DO NOT cash out your TSP. Leave it invested or roll it into a civilian 401(k) or IRA. Cashing out triggers taxes and penalties.

**Mistake #6: Not increasing contributions as you get promoted**
When you make E5, E6, E7, or commission - increase your TSP percentage. You won't miss the money, and future you will thank you.

**Mistake #7: Panicking during market downturns**
When the stock market crashes (and it will), DO NOT move everything to the G Fund. Ride it out. Stocks always recover over the long term.

## How to Set Up and Manage Your TSP

### Initial Setup

**Step 1: Log in to myPay**
- Go to mypay.dfas.mil
- Use your CAC or login credentials

**Step 2: Set your contribution percentage**
- Navigate to TSP section
- Choose percentage of base pay to contribute
- Select Roth or Traditional (or split between both)
- Submit election

**Step 3: Choose your fund allocation**
- Log in to tsp.gov
- Go to "Contribution Allocation"
- Select funds and percentages (must total 100%)
- If you want Lifecycle funds, put 100% in your chosen L Fund

**Changes take effect:** Usually 1-2 pay periods

### Rebalancing Your Portfolio

Over time, your fund allocation will drift as some funds grow faster than others.

**Example:**
- You set 60% C Fund, 40% S Fund
- After 5 years, C Fund grew more
- Now your allocation is 65% C Fund, 35% S Fund

**To rebalance:**
- Log in to tsp.gov
- Use "Interfund Transfer" to shift money between funds
- Bring allocation back to your target percentages

**How often:** Once or twice per year is plenty

### Increasing Your Contributions

**Annual raises:** Every time you get a raise or promotion, increase your TSP contribution percentage by 1-2%.

**Example:**
- E4 contributing 5%
- Get promoted to E5 with 10% pay raise
- Increase TSP to 7%
- You still take home more money, but you're saving more for retirement

**Automatic increases:** TSP doesn't have auto-escalation, so set a calendar reminder to increase annually.

## Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) and TSP

If you deploy to a combat zone, your pay is tax-exempt under CZTE. This creates a unique TSP opportunity.

**CZTE + Roth TSP = Tax-Free Forever**

If you contribute to Roth TSP while receiving CZTE pay:
- Your contributions are tax-free (CZTE)
- Your withdrawals are tax-free (Roth)
- **You never pay taxes on that money, ever**

**Strategy during deployment:**
- Max out TSP contributions if possible
- Use Roth TSP exclusively
- This is one of the best tax advantages in existence

**2025 TSP limit:** $23,000
**Deployment length:** 6-9 months
**If you max out:** That's $23,000 that will NEVER be taxed

## TSP in Retirement: When Can You Withdraw?

**Earliest withdrawal age:** 59.5 (without penalties)
**Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** Age 73 (you must start withdrawing by this age)

**Withdrawal options:**
- Monthly payments (like a paycheck)
- Lump sum
- Annuity (guaranteed income for life)
- Leave it in TSP and withdraw as needed

**Penalty for early withdrawal:** 10% penalty + taxes if you withdraw before 59.5 (exceptions exist)

**Exception for military:** If you separate from service in the year you turn 55 or later, you can withdraw penalty-free (but still pay taxes on Traditional TSP).

## Rolling TSP to an IRA

If you separate before retirement age, you have options:

**Option 1: Leave it in TSP**
- Low fees
- Keep it growing
- Can still withdraw at 59.5

**Option 2: Roll to civilian 401(k)**
- If your new employer has a 401(k), you can roll TSP into it
- Check fees - civilian 401(k) fees are usually much higher than TSP

**Option 3: Roll to IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- More investment options than TSP
- Choose your own brokerage (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab)
- May have higher fees depending on investments

**Recommendation:** If you separate before 59.5, leave your money in TSP. The fees are unbeatable. When you're closer to retirement, decide if you want to move it.

## Real Scenarios: What TSP Could Be Worth

Let's look at real projections based on different contribution levels.

### Scenario 1: E4, Age 22, Contributes 5% for 20 Years

- Base pay: $2,500/month
- Contribution: $125/month (5%)
- BRS match: $150/month (6% total = $275/month invested)
- Time: 20 years
- Average return: 8%

**TSP balance at age 42:** ~$160,000

If left to grow another 18 years until age 60:
**TSP balance at age 60:** ~$640,000

### Scenario 2: E6, Age 28, Contributes 15% for 12 Years

- Base pay: $3,500/month
- Contribution: $525/month (15%)
- BRS match: $210/month (6% total = $735/month invested)
- Time: 12 years
- Average return: 8%

**TSP balance at age 40:** ~$165,000

If left to grow another 20 years until age 60:
**TSP balance at age 60:** ~$770,000

### Scenario 3: Officer, Age 25, Maxes Out TSP for 10 Years

- Max contribution: $23,000/year (~$1,917/month)
- BRS match: ~$300/month
- Total: $2,217/month
- Time: 10 years
- Average return: 8%

**TSP balance at age 35:** ~$405,000

If left to grow another 25 years until age 60:
**TSP balance at age 60:** ~$2.8 million

**Key takeaway:** The earlier you start and the more you contribute, the more dramatic the results.

## Action Steps: What to Do Right Now

**Step 1: Check your current contribution percentage**
- Log in to myPay
- See what you're currently contributing
- If it's less than 5%, increase it immediately

**Step 2: Choose Roth or Traditional**
- For most military members: Choose Roth
- If you're senior enlisted or officer: Consider splitting 75% Roth, 25% Traditional

**Step 3: Pick your funds**
- If you don't want to manage it: Choose a Lifecycle (L) Fund based on your retirement year
- If you want control: Use a 3-fund portfolio (60% C, 20% S, 20% I if you're young)

**Step 4: Set up auto-increases**
- Set a calendar reminder to increase contributions by 1% every year
- Or increase by 2% every time you get promoted

**Step 5: Don't touch it**
- Let it grow for decades
- Don't panic during market crashes
- Don't cash out when you separate

## The Bottom Line on TSP

TSP is one of the best financial benefits the military offers. Low fees, solid fund options, and tax advantages most civilian employees don't get.

**Minimum action:** Contribute 5% to get the BRS match (if applicable)

**Better action:** Contribute 10-15% in Roth TSP, invest in C/S/I Funds or an L Fund

**Best action:** Max it out ($23,000/year), especially during deployments with CZTE

The difference between starting now and starting later is literally hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Don't be the person who retires and wishes they'd started contributing at 22 instead of 32.
