# Licensure Portability for Military Spouses by State: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Professional license portability has improved dramatically for military spouses, but the landscape remains complex. As of 2024, **48+ states** have laws expediting licensure for military spouses, and several **interstate compacts** now allow multi-state practice. Nursing (40+ states), psychology (41+ states), and teaching (40+ states via compact) have made the biggest gains. This guide covers the current state of licensure portability, profession by profession, and strategies for managing your credentials through PCS moves.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

State-by-state licensing has historically devastated military spouse careers:
- Average relicensure time: 3-6 months
- Fees: $100-$1,000 per application
- Lost income during wait period
- May require additional exams or coursework
- Some states don't recognize out-of-state experience

**The Good News:** Legislative changes since 2019 have dramatically improved portability. The key is understanding which laws and compacts apply to your profession and destination state.

## Interstate Compacts by Profession

### Nursing: Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC)

**Member States (2024):** 41 states including AZ, CO, FL, GA, KY, MD, NC, OH, PA, TX, VA, and most others

**Notable Non-Members:** CA, HI, IL, MA, MI, MN, NV, NY, OR, WA, AK

**How It Works:**
- Declare primary state of residence (must be compact state)
- Receive multistate license
- Practice in all compact states without additional license
- If you PCS to another compact state, practice immediately while establishing new residency

**Impact for Military Spouses:**
- PCS to compact state = practice immediately
- PCS to non-compact state = must apply for that state's license

## Profession-Specific Strategies

### Nursing

**Best Strategy:**
1. Establish primary residence in Compact state
2. Obtain multistate license
3. Practice in any compact state
4. When PCSing to non-compact state, apply early using military spouse provisions

**Reality Check:**
- Most duty stations are in compact states
- California, New York major exceptions
- OCONUS: US license often works on bases

### Teaching

**Best Strategy:**
1. Check Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact status
2. Contact destination state DOE 90 days before PCS
3. Request military spouse expedited processing
4. Get temporary license if full processing takes too long

**Reality Check:**
- Compact significantly improving portability
- Some states still have unique requirements (Praxis, coursework)
- Consider DODEA teaching for ultimate portability

### Counseling/Therapy

**Best Strategy:**
1. Wait for Counseling Compact implementation (2024-2025)
2. Meanwhile, work for multi-state group practices that handle licensing
3. Use military spouse expedited provisions in each state
4. Consider telehealth platforms that credential across states

**Reality Check:**
- PSYPACT helps psychologists now
- LPC/LMHC compact coming soon
- Temporary practice provisions vary by state

### Real Estate

**Best Strategy:**
1. Research reciprocity between states
2. Apply early using military spouse provisions
3. Many states require only exam (no new education)
4. Maintain license in original state while building new

**Reality Check:**
- No national compact for real estate
- Relicensing at each PCS still common
- Many states have partial reciprocity

### Law

**Best Strategy:**
1. Some states have UBE reciprocity
2. Check if destination state has military spouse attorney provisions
3. Consider in-house or federal roles that minimize state bar requirements

**Reality Check:**
- State bar requirements still strict
- Military spouse provisions helping but limited
- Federal practice avoids state bar issues

- Maintaining CEU requirements isn't burdensome

### License Maintenance Strategies

**Keep Track:**

- Online CEUs work for most licenses
- Complete early in renewal cycle

**Cost Management:**

## Success Stories

**Amanda, Navy Spouse - Nurse**
"Before the compact, I relicensed in every state—Virginia, Florida, California, Hawaii. California took 6 months. Now I have a compact license through Texas. When we PCS to Georgia next year, I can work on day one. The compact changed everything."

**Marcus, Army Spouse - Physical Therapist**
"The PT Compact saves me. I've practiced in four states in six years. Without the compact, I'd have spent thousands on relicensing and months waiting. Now it's just paperwork."

**Priya, Air Force Spouse - Teacher**
"Teaching licensure was a nightmare until the Teacher Mobility Compact. I used to face months of paperwork and sometimes new exams. Now states recognize my license. It's not perfect everywhere, but it's dramatically better than five years ago."
