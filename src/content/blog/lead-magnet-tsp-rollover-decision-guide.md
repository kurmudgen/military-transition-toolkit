When you leave military service, one of the most important financial decisions you'll face is what to do with your Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Should you leave it where it is? Roll it to an IRA? Move it to your new employer's 401(k)? Or cash it out (spoiler: almost never do this)?

## INTRODUCTION

### Why This Decision Matters

Your TSP likely represents one of your largest financial assets after military service. The average service member leaves with $50,000-$150,000+ in their TSP. How you manage this money over the next 20-40 years can mean the difference between:

**Good Decision:** $50K grows to $500K-$800K by retirement
**Poor Decision:** $50K grows to only $200K-$300K (or worse, disappears entirely)

**That's a $300K-$500K difference** based on one decision.

### The Challenge

During your final weeks of service, you're overwhelmed with out-processing, job searching, moving, and transition stress. The TSP decision often gets pushed aside or made hastily.

The TSP doesn't require immediate action, which is both good and bad:
- **Good:** You don't have to decide immediately
- **Bad:** Many veterans delay the decision and miss opportunities

### How to Use This Workbook

1. **Read Chapter 1** to understand the basics of your TSP and all options
2. **Review Chapters 2-5** to understand the pros/cons of each option
3. **Use Chapter 7's Decision Framework** to determine your best choice
4. **Follow Chapter 8** for step-by-step implementation

Take your time with this decision. It's too important to rush.

## CHAPTER 1: Understanding Your TSP & Your Options

### What Is the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?

The TSP is a retirement savings plan for federal employees and military members, similar to a 401(k) in the private sector.

**Key Facts:**
- **Contribution limits (2025):** $23,500 per year ($31,000 if age 50+)
- **Investment options:** 5 core funds (G, F, C, S, I) + Lifecycle (L) Funds
- **Fees:** Incredibly low (0.055% or less)
- **Tax treatment:** Traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) options
- **Employer match:** Up to 5% for FERS employees (not applicable to most military)

### What Happens to Your TSP When You Separate?

**Important:** Your TSP does NOT disappear when you leave service.

**Automatic Actions:**
✅ Your account remains open
✅ Money stays invested in your chosen funds
✅ Continues to grow (or shrink) based on market performance
✅ Fees stay the same (very low)

**What Stops:**
❌ You can no longer make contributions (unless you get a federal civilian job)
❌ You can no longer receive matching (military didn't get matching anyway)

**What You CAN Do:**
✓ Leave it alone indefinitely (if balance > $200)
✓ Roll it over to an IRA
✓ Roll it over to new employer's 401(k)
✓ Withdraw it (with penalties and taxes if under 59½)

---

### Your 4 Main Options

#### **OPTION 1: Leave Money in TSP**

**What It Means:**
Do nothing. Your money stays in the TSP under the same terms.

**Best For:**
- Veterans happy with TSP investment options
- Those wanting the lowest possible fees
- Anyone who might return to federal service
- Those without better alternatives

**Considerations:**
- Can't contribute anymore (unless you get federal job)
- Limited investment options (only 5 core funds + L funds)
- Withdrawal rules may be less flexible than IRA

---

#### **OPTION 2: Roll Over to IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**

**What It Means:**
Transfer your TSP money into an IRA you open with a brokerage (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, etc.)

**Best For:**
- Veterans wanting more investment options
- Those who value flexibility
- People wanting to consolidate retirement accounts
- Anyone planning sophisticated retirement strategies (Roth conversions, etc.)

**Considerations:**
- Fees may be higher than TSP (though can be very low at good brokerages)
- More investment options = more responsibility/complexity
- No going back to TSP once rolled over

---

#### **OPTION 3: Roll Over to New Employer's 401(k)**

**What It Means:**
Transfer your TSP into your new civilian employer's 401(k) plan

**Best For:**
- Those wanting all retirement money in one place
- Employees with excellent 401(k) plans
- People who prefer simplicity over flexibility

**Considerations:**
- New 401(k) must accept rollovers (not all do)
- Fees often higher than TSP or IRA
- Investment options limited to what employer offers
- Generally NOT recommended unless employer 401(k) is exceptional

---

#### **OPTION 4: Cash Out (Lump-Sum Withdrawal)**

**What It Means:**
Withdraw all your TSP money as cash

**Best For:**
- Extreme financial emergencies (medical debt, foreclosure prevention)
- Literally almost no other situations

**Why It's Usually a TERRIBLE Idea:**
- **Income taxes:** Entire amount taxed as ordinary income
- **Early withdrawal penalty:** 10% penalty if under age 59½
- **Lost growth:** Missing out on decades of compound growth
- **Retirement jeopardy:** Starting over from zero

**Example of How Bad This Is:**

**Scenario:** $50,000 TSP balance, age 35, cash out

**Immediate Costs:**
- Federal income tax (22% bracket): -$11,000
- State income tax (5% avg): -$2,500
- Early withdrawal penalty (10%): -$5,000
- **Cash you receive:** $31,500

**Lost Future Value:**
- $50K left in TSP for 30 years at 7% growth = **$380,000**
- You gave up **$348,500** to get $31,500 now

**This is financial suicide.** Don't do it unless facing foreclosure or similar emergency.

---

### Key Factors in Your Decision

**1. Fees**
- TSP: ~0.05% (incredibly low)
- IRA (at Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab): 0.03%-0.20%
- Typical employer 401(k): 0.50%-1.50%

**Even 1% difference costs huge money over time**

**Example:** $100K over 30 years
- At 0.05% fee + 7% growth = $728,000
- At 1.05% fee + 6% growth = $551,000
- **Difference: $177,000 lost to fees**

**2. Investment Options**
- TSP: 5 funds + Lifecycle funds (limited but solid)
- IRA: Thousands of investment options (stocks, bonds, ETFs, REITs, etc.)
- 401(k): Varies (usually 10-50 fund options)

**3. Flexibility**
- IRA: Most flexible (withdrawals, conversions, estate planning)
- TSP: Some restrictions (can't do in-service Roth conversions)
- 401(k): Least flexible (locked into employer's rules)

**4. Future Plans**
- Returning to federal service? **Keep TSP**
- Want sophisticated retirement strategies? **IRA**
- Want simplicity? **Could be TSP or IRA depending on preference**

---

### ✓ ACTION ITEMS: Understanding Your Situation

□ Log into your TSP account (tsp.gov)
□ Note your current balance
□ Review your current fund allocation
□ Determine if you have Traditional TSP, Roth TSP, or both
□ List your priorities (low fees vs. flexibility vs. simplicity)
□ Consider whether you might return to federal service

---

## CHAPTER 2: Option 1 - Leave Money in TSP

### Why This Is Often the Best Choice

For many veterans, leaving money in the TSP is actually the optimal decision. Here's why:

### ✅ ADVANTAGES OF LEAVING MONEY IN TSP

#### **1. Lowest Fees in the Industry**

TSP expense ratio: **0.055%** (as of 2024)

This is lower than:
- 99% of mutual funds
- Most index funds
- Many employer 401(k)s

**Fee Impact Over 30 Years:**

| Account Balance | TSP (0.055%) | Avg 401(k) (0.80%) | Difference |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| $50,000 | $174 | $2,519 | **$2,345** |
| $100,000 | $348 | $5,038 | **$4,690** |
| $200,000 | $696 | $10,075 | **$9,379** |

Lower fees = more money stays in YOUR account growing.

#### **2. Excellent Investment Options**

While TSP offers "only" 5 core funds, they're world-class:

**G Fund (Government Securities)**
- Unique to TSP (can't replicate in IRA)
- Never loses value
- Better returns than money market
- Zero risk

**F Fund (Fixed Income Index)**
- Tracks Barclays Aggregate Bond Index
- Broad bond market exposure

**C Fund (Common Stock Index)**
- Tracks S&P 500
- Large-cap U.S. stocks
- Historically ~10% annual returns

**S Fund (Small Cap Stock Index)**
- Tracks Dow Jones Small-Cap Index
- Small/mid-cap U.S. stocks
- Higher risk/reward than C Fund

**I Fund (International Stock Index)**
- Tracks MSCI EAFE Index
- International developed markets
- Geographic diversification

**Lifecycle (L) Funds**
- Automatically adjust allocation as you age
- "Set it and forget it" option
- Low-stress diversification

💡 **Pro Tip:** These 5 funds are all you need for a complete, diversified portfolio. More options doesn't always mean better returns.

#### **3. Simplicity**

**With TSP:**
- One account to track
- One login
- One statement
- Easy to understand

**With multiple IRAs/401(k)s:**
- Multiple accounts
- Multiple logins
- Tracking becomes complex
- Higher chance of losing track of accounts

#### **4. Strong Creditor Protection**

TSP has federal protection from creditors and lawsuits (similar to ERISA protections for 401(k)s).

IRAs have weaker protection in bankruptcy (varies by state).

#### **5. Option to Return**

If you later take a federal civilian job, you can:
- Resume contributing to TSP
- Keep all previous balance
- Continue benefiting from low fees

If you roll TSP to IRA, **you can never move money back to TSP.**

---

### ❌ DISADVANTAGES OF LEAVING MONEY IN TSP

#### **1. Limited Investment Options**

Only 5 core funds + L Funds means:
- No individual stocks
- No REITs
- No international emerging markets
- No specific sector funds (technology, healthcare, etc.)
- No alternatives (commodities, precious metals)

**Counterpoint:** Do you actually need more options? The 5 TSP funds cover the fundamentals.

#### **2. No New Contributions** (Unless You Return to Federal Service)

Once separated, you can't add more money.

**Workaround:** Open an IRA for new contributions while leaving TSP money where it is.

#### **3. Less Withdrawal Flexibility**

**TSP Withdrawal Options:**
- Monthly payments
- Single withdrawal
- Life annuity

**IRA Withdrawal Flexibility:**
- Withdraw any amount, any time
- More control over distributions
- Better for retirement income planning

#### **4. Estate Planning Limitations**

IRAs offer more sophisticated estate planning options (stretch IRAs, Roth conversions, etc.)

TSP has fewer options for beneficiaries.

#### **5. Customer Service Can Be Slow**

TSP is a government program. Customer service isn't always as responsive as private brokerages.

---

### WHO SHOULD LEAVE MONEY IN TSP?

✅ **Leave Money in TSP If:**

□ You're satisfied with the 5 core fund options
□ You prioritize low fees above all else
□ You value simplicity
□ You might return to federal service someday
□ You're not confident managing your own IRA investments
□ You have other retirement accounts for more aggressive investing
□ Your balance is large ($100K+) and fees matter significantly

❌ **Consider Alternatives If:**

□ You want more investment options (individual stocks, sector funds, etc.)
□ You need more flexible withdrawal options
□ You're planning complex retirement strategies (Roth conversions, etc.)
□ You want everything in one IRA for simplicity
□ You have professional investment advisor you want to work with

---

### What You CAN Do While Leaving Money in TSP

Even if you leave money in TSP, you can still:

✅ **Change your investment allocation**
- Reallocate between funds anytime
- Adjust as you get older

✅ **Take loans** (with restrictions)
- Must have federal employment to take new loans
- Existing loans must be repaid

✅ **Make partial withdrawals** (age 59½+)
- Take money out when eligible
- No mandatory withdrawals until age 73

✅ **Transfer to surviving spouse**
- Spouse can keep in TSP or roll to their own IRA

---

### ✓ ACTION ITEMS: Evaluating Leaving Money in TSP

□ Review your current TSP fund allocation
□ Calculate how much fees would cost in IRA vs. TSP (use calculator in Chapter 7)
□ Determine if 5 core funds meet your investment needs
□ Assess likelihood of returning to federal service
□ Decide if simplicity or flexibility is more important to you

---

## CHAPTER 3: Option 2 - Roll Over to an IRA

### Why IRAs Are Popular with Veterans

Rolling TSP to an IRA is the most common choice for veterans who want more control and flexibility.

### ✅ ADVANTAGES OF ROLLING TO AN IRA

#### **1. Unlimited Investment Options**

**With IRA you can invest in:**
✓ Individual stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, etc.)
✓ Bonds (corporate, municipal, treasury)
✓ ETFs (thousands of options)
✓ Mutual funds (tens of thousands)
✓ REITs (real estate investment trusts)
✓ Index funds (track any index)
✓ Sector funds (technology, healthcare, energy)
✓ International markets
✓ And more...

**Example Portfolio Possibilities:**

**Conservative (Age 55+):**
- 40% Total Bond Market ETF
- 30% S&P 500 Index Fund
- 20% Dividend stocks (Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson)
- 10% REIT Fund

**Aggressive (Age 30):**
- 60% S&P 500 Index
- 20% Small-cap growth
- 10% International emerging markets
- 10% Technology stocks

You can't build these specific portfolios in TSP.

#### **2. Maximum Flexibility**

**Withdrawal Flexibility:**
- Take money out anytime (subject to age/tax rules)
- Withdraw any amount
- No restrictions on frequency
- Better control for retirement income planning

**Conversion Flexibility:**
- Can convert Traditional IRA to Roth IRA anytime
- Strategic tax planning opportunities
- TSP has limited Roth conversion options

**Beneficiary Flexibility:**
- More sophisticated estate planning
- Stretch IRA options for heirs
- Better control over legacy

#### **3. Consolidation of Accounts**

If you have multiple retirement accounts from different jobs:
- Roll everything into ONE IRA
- Easier tracking and management
- Simplified Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) at age 73
- One statement, one tax form

**Example:**
- TSP: $50K
- Old employer 401(k): $30K
- Another old 401(k): $20K
- **Roll all → One IRA: $100K** (much easier to manage)

#### **4. Professional Management (If Desired)**

With IRA, you can:
- Hire financial advisor
- Use robo-advisor (Betterment, Wealthfront)
- Get personalized advice

TSP doesn't offer advisory services.

#### **5. Low-Cost Options Available**

While TSP has the lowest fees overall, you can get VERY close with good brokerages:

**Low-Cost IRA Providers:**
- **Vanguard:** Index funds 0.03%-0.10%
- **Fidelity:** Many zero-fee index funds
- **Schwab:** Low-cost index funds 0.03%-0.08%

**Example:**
- TSP C Fund (S&P 500): 0.055% fee
- Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO): 0.03% fee
- Fidelity S&P 500 Index (FXAIX): 0.015% fee

**You can match or beat TSP fees** with the right IRA provider.

---

### ❌ DISADVANTAGES OF ROLLING TO AN IRA

#### **1. Potential for Higher Fees**

While low-cost options exist, you could pay much higher fees if you:
- Choose expensive actively managed funds (1-2% fees)
- Hire expensive financial advisor (1% annual fee)
- Trade frequently (commission costs)

**Bad Example:**
- Financial advisor: 1% annual fee ($1,000 per $100K)
- Actively managed funds: 1% expense ratio
- **Total cost: 2% per year** (40x more expensive than TSP!)

**Over 30 years, 2% annual fees could cost you 40-50% of your returns.**

⚠️ **Solution:** Stick to low-cost index funds at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab.

#### **2. More Complexity & Responsibility**

With IRA you must:
- Choose your own investments
- Rebalance periodically
- Make tax decisions
- Track performance
- Avoid emotional investing mistakes

TSP Lifecycle Funds do this automatically.

**Question:** Are you comfortable making these decisions?

#### **3. No G Fund Equivalent**

The TSP G Fund is unique. It:
- Never loses value
- Pays returns better than money market
- Has zero risk

There's no true equivalent in the private sector.

**Closest alternatives:**
- Money market funds (lower returns)
- Short-term treasury funds (slight risk of loss)
- High-yield savings accounts (not in IRA)

#### **4. Can't Go Back to TSP**

Once you roll to IRA, **you can never move money back to TSP** (even if you return to federal service).

**Exception:** You can contribute NEW money to TSP if you get federal job, but can't re-deposit rolled-over funds.

#### **5. Weaker Creditor Protection** (Varies by State)

- TSP: Strong federal protection
- IRA: Protection varies by state, generally weaker in bankruptcy

Most states protect at least some IRA assets, but it's not as bulletproof as TSP.
