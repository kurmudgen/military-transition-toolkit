## Key Takeaways

1. **Columbia leads for overall value** - Jobs, schools, quality of life, Fort Meade access
2. **Baltimore City leads for affordability** - $229K median, three VA facilities
3. **Odenton/Severn leads for Fort Meade** - 5-10 minute commute to NSA
4. **Bel Air leads for Aberdeen** - 15 minutes to Proving Ground, great schools
5. **All cities benefit from partial military retirement exemption** ($12.5K-$20K)
6. **100% disabled veterans save $2,500-$6,000+ annually** through property tax exemption

Maryland offers exceptional opportunities for military retirees, particularly those in cybersecurity/intelligence fields. The property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans is among the most valuable in the nation - often worth more than full military retirement exemption in other states.

**Housing costs are high**, but salaries (especially federal/contractor cyber jobs) justify them. The combination of federal employment opportunities, top schools (Howard County), and property tax exemption makes Maryland highly competitive despite high cost of living.
