# High Cholesterol Secondary to Diabetes: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** LIMITED - Hyperlipidemia alone is generally not ratable
- **Medical nexus required?** YES (if pursuing service connection)
- **VA Rating:** Generally 0% (not separately compensable)
- **Strategic Value:** Supports claims for cardiovascular disease, protects overall rating
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected diabetes, lipid panel history, nexus if pursuing connection

**Important:** Like obesity and hypertension, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) is considered a "laboratory finding" rather than a disease by the VA. However, establishing service connection has strategic value for future claims.

## Understanding the VA's Position on High Cholesterol

### High Cholesterol Is Generally Not Separately Ratable

The VA considers elevated cholesterol a laboratory finding, not a disability. There is no specific diagnostic code for hyperlipidemia with a compensable rating schedule.

### Why Pursue Service Connection Anyway?

1. **Opens door to cardiovascular disease claims** - Heart disease secondary to service-connected hyperlipidemia
2. **Supports overall disability picture** - Documents comprehensive impact of diabetes
3. **Protects future claims** - Establishes the metabolic chain
4. **Treatment documentation** - VA will cover cholesterol medications

## How High Cholesterol Relates to Diabetes

### Medical Connection

Diabetes and hyperlipidemia are intimately connected:

**Diabetic Dyslipidemia:**
- Diabetes specifically causes characteristic lipid abnormalities
- Elevated triglycerides
- Low HDL (good) cholesterol
- Small, dense LDL particles (more atherogenic)
- This pattern is called "diabetic dyslipidemia"

**Insulin Resistance:**
- Insulin resistance affects lipid metabolism
- Liver overproduces VLDL
- Lipoprotein lipase activity decreased
- Lipid clearance impaired

**Mechanism:**
- Diabetes → Insulin resistance → Altered liver metabolism → Hyperlipidemia
- This is a direct metabolic consequence, not coincidental

### Prevalence

- **70-80% of diabetics** have dyslipidemia
- Diabetes-related cardiovascular disease is leading cause of death in diabetics
- Diabetic dyslipidemia accounts for significant portion of CVD risk

## What You Can Actually Claim

### Direct Claim: Service Connection for Hyperlipidemia

**Likely Outcome:** 0% service-connected (no compensable rating)

**Value:**
- Establishes service connection
- VA covers medication
- Supports future claims

### Strategic Claims Through Hyperlipidemia

**Coronary Artery Disease:**
- Diabetes → Hyperlipidemia → CAD
- CAD rated 10-100% under DC 7005

**Peripheral Vascular Disease:**
- Lipid abnormalities → Atherosclerosis → PVD
- Rated under cardiovascular codes

**Stroke/TIA History:**
- Hyperlipidemia increases stroke risk
- Stroke residuals rated under various codes

## Evidence for Hyperlipidemia Claim

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition (Diabetes)
- Service connection documentation
- Current diabetes rating
- Treatment records
- A1C history

#### For Your Secondary Condition (Hyperlipidemia)
- Lipid panel results over time
- Treatment records
- Statin/medication history
- Any cardiovascular evaluations

### Lipid Panel Evidence

Document progression showing diabetic dyslipidemia pattern:
- Total cholesterol
- LDL cholesterol
- HDL cholesterol
- Triglycerides
- LDL particle size if available

### The Nexus Letter

Even for a 0% claim, a nexus establishes connection:

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for type 2 diabetes mellitus. [Veteran] has developed hyperlipidemia characterized by elevated triglycerides ([X] mg/dL), low HDL ([X] mg/dL), and elevated LDL ([X] mg/dL).*

*This lipid pattern is consistent with diabetic dyslipidemia, a well-recognized metabolic consequence of diabetes. It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] hyperlipidemia is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected diabetes mellitus.*

*Medical Rationale: Diabetes causes insulin resistance, which leads to hepatic overproduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and decreased clearance of circulating lipids. The specific lipid abnormalities present in [Veteran]—the 'lipid triad' of high triglycerides, low HDL, and atherogenic LDL particles—are pathognomonic for diabetic dyslipidemia."*

## Filing Strategy

### Option 1: File for Hyperlipidemia Service Connection

**Pros:**
- Establishes the chain for future claims
- VA covers medication costs
- Documents complete metabolic picture

**Cons:**
- Likely 0% rating
- No immediate compensation

**Process:**
- File VA Form 21-526EZ
- Select "secondary" claim type
- Link to diabetes
- Include lipid panels and nexus

### Option 2: Skip to Cardiovascular Claim

If you already have cardiovascular disease, claim that directly:
- Coronary artery disease secondary to diabetes and hyperlipidemia
- You can establish hyperlipidemia service connection as part of the causal chain

### Option 3: Wait for Complications

If you don't have cardiovascular disease yet:
- Get regular cardiac screenings
- Document lipid abnormalities now
- Claim cardiovascular disease when/if it develops

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Expecting compensable rating** - Hyperlipidemia alone typically rates 0%

2. **Not filing at all** - Service connection still has value

3. **Missing the cardiovascular claim** - If you have heart disease, that's the real claim

4. **Not documenting progression** - Keep all lipid panels

5. **Forgetting medication** - Service connection means VA covers statins

## Real Veteran Example

### Case Study: Strategic Claim Progression

**Background:** 55-year-old Army veteran, 40% diabetes
**Initial Condition:** Diabetic dyslipidemia on atorvastatin

**Step 1:** Filed hyperlipidemia secondary to diabetes
**Result:** 0% service-connected (no compensation but connection established)

**Step 2:** Developed coronary artery disease 3 years later
**Claim:** CAD secondary to service-connected diabetes and hyperlipidemia

**Result:** 30% for CAD
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 50%
**Monthly Increase:** $175.42

**Value of Initial 0% Claim:** Established the metabolic pathway that supported CAD claim.

## If Cardiovascular Disease Develops

### Conditions to Claim Secondary to Diabetes/Hyperlipidemia

**Coronary Artery Disease (DC 7005):**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Continuous medication or workload of 7-10 METs |
| 30% | Workload of 5-7 METs |
| 60% | More than one episode of CHF in past year, or workload 3-5 METs |
| 100% | Chronic CHF, or workload 3 METs or less |

**Peripheral Vascular Disease**
**Stroke Residuals**
**Cardiac Arrhythmias**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is there any rating for high cholesterol?**
A: No specific compensable rating. It's typically rated 0% if service-connected.

**Q: Why bother claiming if it's 0%?**
A: Service connection establishes the causal chain for future cardiovascular claims and VA covers medications.

**Q: Can high cholesterol alone ever be rated?**
A: Generally no. The VA considers it a lab finding, not a disability.

**Q: Should I claim hyperlipidemia or wait for heart disease?**
A: If you have time and energy, establishing the 0% connection now supports future claims. If you already have heart disease, claim that directly.

**Q: Will the VA cover my cholesterol medication?**
A: Yes, if hyperlipidemia is service-connected (even at 0%).

**Q: What if I have high cholesterol but no diabetes?**
A: You would need to establish another service-connected condition as the cause, such as PTSD medication effects or weight gain from service-connected conditions.
