## What Is an Electrician License?

Electricians install, maintain, and repair electrical systems in buildings and structures. Licensing requirements vary by state but generally include:

**Apprentice Electrician:** Working under supervision while learning (4-5 years typically)

**Master Electrician:** Can pull permits, supervise others, own business (additional experience + exam)

Most states require specific hour requirements (typically 8,000 hours) plus passing state or national exams.

## Why Veterans Excel as Electricians

Military electrical training translates directly:

**Technical foundation:** Military electrical training often exceeds entry-level civilian requirements.

**Safety discipline:** Electrical work is dangerous. Your military safety training could save lives—including your own.

**Physical capability:** Electricians work in challenging conditions—heights, confined spaces, weather.

**Problem-solving:** Electrical troubleshooting requires logical thinking under pressure.

**Precision:** Electrical work requires exactness. Military attention to detail applies directly.
