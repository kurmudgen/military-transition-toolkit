# Degenerative Disc Disease Secondary to Back Injury: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** COMPLICATED - Often progression of same condition
- **Key Understanding:** DDD at SAME level may be increase, not secondary
- **When Secondary Works:** DDD at DIFFERENT spinal levels from original injury
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-40%
- **Key evidence needed:** Original back injury service connection, new level DDD, imaging comparison, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate (55-70%) with clear different-level involvement

Understanding when degenerative disc disease is a secondary condition versus a progression of your current rating is crucial for filing correctly.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

**For DDD as Secondary:**
- Original back injury at one level service-connected
- DDD develops at DIFFERENT spinal levels
- Original injury caused the new DDD through altered mechanics

**For DDD as Increase (NOT Secondary):**
- DDD at the SAME level as original injury
- This is worsening of current condition
- File for INCREASE, not secondary claim

## Understanding the Distinction

### When to File Secondary Claim

**File Secondary If:**
- You have lumbar injury at L4-5, now have cervical DDD
- You have cervical injury, now have lumbar/thoracic DDD
- Original injury at one level, DDD at adjacent levels
- Different region of spine affected

**Example:**
- Service-connected: L5-S1 disc herniation
- New condition: C5-6 DDD from compensatory posture
- This IS a secondary claim

### When to File Increase

**File Increase If:**
- DDD at same level as original injury
- Original condition has worsened
- Same spinal region, just worse

**Example:**
- Service-connected: L5-S1 lumbar strain
- Now have: L5-S1 DDD
- This is INCREASE, not secondary

### The Compensation Pyramid

**Original Injury → Adjacent Level DDD → Further Progression**

Each step CAN be secondary if different levels involved.

## How Back Injuries Cause DDD at Other Levels

### Compensatory Stress

**Mechanism:**
- Injured level loses motion
- Adjacent levels work harder
- Increased stress accelerates degeneration
- "Adjacent segment disease"

**Example:**
- L4-5 fused/stiff from injury
- L3-4 and L5-S1 now bear more load
- Those levels degenerate faster

### Altered Biomechanics

**Changes That Cause DDD:**
- Loss of normal spinal curves
- Muscle guarding changes posture
- Asymmetric loading
- Abnormal motion patterns

### Cervical-Lumbar Connection

**How Lower Back Affects Neck:**
- Lumbar pain causes forward head posture
- Compensatory cervical strain
- Years of altered posture → cervical DDD

**How Neck Affects Lower Back:**
- Cervical injury changes gait
- Altered balance and posture
- Lumbar compensation → lumbar DDD

## VA Rating Criteria for DDD/Spine

Spinal conditions are rated under the General Rating Formula (DC 5235-5243):

### General Rating Formula

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Forward flexion >60° but ≤85°; OR combined ROM >120° but ≤235°; OR muscle spasm/guarding not resulting in abnormal gait |
| 20% | Forward flexion >30° but ≤60°; OR combined ROM ≤120°; OR muscle spasm/guarding with abnormal gait or abnormal contour |
| 30% | Forward flexion ≤30° |
| 40% | Favorable ankylosis of entire thoracolumbar spine |
| 50% | Unfavorable ankylosis of entire thoracolumbar spine |
| 100% | Unfavorable ankylosis of entire spine |

### Cervical Spine Specific

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Forward flexion >30° but ≤40°; OR combined ROM >170° but ≤335° |
| 20% | Forward flexion >15° but ≤30°; OR combined ROM ≤170° |
| 30% | Forward flexion ≤15° |
| 40% | Favorable ankylosis of entire cervical spine |

### Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) - DC 5243

Can alternatively be rated on incapacitating episodes:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Incapacitating episodes ≥1 but <2 weeks per year |
| 20% | Incapacitating episodes ≥2 but <4 weeks per year |
| 40% | Incapacitating episodes ≥4 but <6 weeks per year |
| 60% | Incapacitating episodes ≥6 weeks per year |

**Incapacitating episode** = Bed rest prescribed by physician

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Original Back Injury:**
- Service connection letter
- Original imaging (MRI, X-ray)
- Level(s) involved in original injury
- Treatment history

**For New DDD:**
- Current imaging showing DDD at different levels
- Comparison to old imaging
- Treatment records
- Symptom documentation

### Critical: Imaging Comparison

**Must Show:**
- Original injury level (from old imaging)
- New DDD at DIFFERENT level (from current imaging)
- Progression timeline

**Example Documentation:**
- 2015 MRI: L5-S1 disc herniation
- 2025 MRI: L5-S1 herniation PLUS L3-4 DDD, C5-6 DDD
- New levels = secondary claim opportunity

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Must Clearly Establish:**
1. Original injury service-connected
2. New DDD at DIFFERENT level
3. Mechanism of secondary development
4. Medical rationale

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including historical and current spinal imaging. [Veteran] is service-connected for lumbar strain with L5-S1 disc herniation at [X]%.*

*Current imaging reveals degenerative disc disease at C5-6 and C6-7, levels NOT involved in the original service-connected injury.*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] cervical degenerative disc disease is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected lumbar condition.*

*Medical Rationale: Chronic lumbar pain causes compensatory changes in cervical posture. [Veteran] has maintained forward head posture and increased cervical lordosis to compensate for lumbar symptoms. This chronic compensatory positioning accelerates cervical disc degeneration. Additionally, altered gait from lumbar pain affects the entire kinetic chain including the cervical spine. The development of cervical DDD in a patient with chronic lumbar pathology represents a recognized pattern of 'adjacent segment' and compensatory degeneration."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Review Your Original Rating

Determine:
- What level(s) are currently service-connected?
- Is the new DDD at a DIFFERENT level?
- If same level → file for increase, not secondary

### Step 2: Get Current Imaging

Obtain recent MRI or X-ray:
- Shows current disc status
- Identifies all levels involved
- Comparison to baseline

### Step 3: Document Different Levels

Create clear documentation:
- Original injury: [levels]
- New DDD: [different levels]
- Timeline of development

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get spine specialist opinion:
- Must address level distinction
- Explain compensatory mechanism
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Correctly

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim for NEW levels only
- OR increase claim for same level worsening
- Don't mix them up

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Full spinal examination expected
- ROM testing all regions
- Neurological evaluation
- Discuss both areas

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Filing secondary for same level** - This is increase, not secondary

2. **Not getting new imaging** - Need current MRI/X-ray

3. **Missing level distinction** - Nexus must clearly differentiate

4. **Forgetting neurological component** - If radiculopathy, claim separately

5. **Not connecting regions** - Must explain cervical-lumbar relationship

6. **Vague nexus** - Must specify exact levels and mechanism

7. **Wrong claim type** - Secondary vs. increase matters

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Lumbar to Cervical

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, 40% L5-S1 DDD
- Cervical pain developing over 10 years
- MRI shows C5-6, C6-7 DDD
- No cervical injury history

**Evidence:**
- Original lumbar imaging (L5-S1 only)
- Current cervical MRI showing DDD
- Nexus explaining compensatory mechanism

**Outcome:** 20% for cervical DDD (secondary)
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 52% (rounds to 50%)

### Case Study 2: Adjacent Segment

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, 20% L4-5 disc injury
- Progressive back pain
- MRI now shows L3-4, L5-S1 DDD (adjacent levels)
- L4-5 unchanged

**Evidence:**
- Original imaging showing only L4-5
- Current imaging showing adjacent level disease
- Spine surgeon nexus on adjacent segment degeneration

**Outcome:** Additional 10% for adjacent level DDD
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 30%

### Case Study 3: Increase vs. Secondary Confusion

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, 10% lumbar strain
- Now has L4-5 DDD at same location
- Filed secondary claim

**Correct Approach:**
- This should have been INCREASE claim
- DDD at same level = progression
- Resubmitted as increase

**Outcome:** Increased to 20% for same condition

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Cervical DDD 20% added to Lumbar 40%:**
- Before: 40% = $673.28
- Add 20% cervical = 52% → rounds to 50%
- After: $1,041.82
- Increase: $368.54/month

**Multiple Spinal Ratings:**
- Lumbar: 40%
- Cervical: 20%
- Combined: 52% → 50%
- Plus any radiculopathy ratings (separate)

## Associated Secondary Claims

### Radiculopathy

If DDD causes nerve symptoms:
- Claim radiculopathy secondary to DDD
- Rated separately per extremity
- See radiculopathy guide

### Other Spinal Conditions

**May Also Develop:**
- Spinal stenosis
- Facet arthropathy
- Spondylolisthesis
- Each can be claimed if distinct

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Same level as original injury"** - File increase instead
2. **"Natural aging process"** - Need stronger causation evidence
3. **"No nexus to service-connected condition"** - Need specialist opinion

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Clarify levels involved
- Add imaging comparison
- Stronger nexus addressing mechanism
- Medical literature on adjacent segment disease

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know if DDD is secondary or an increase?**
A: Different spinal level = secondary. Same level = increase.

**Q: Can cervical DDD be secondary to lumbar condition?**
A: Yes. Compensatory posture and altered mechanics can cause this.

**Q: What's adjacent segment disease?**
A: DDD that develops at levels next to an injured/fused segment due to increased stress.

**Q: Do I need a new MRI?**
A: Yes, to document current disc status and compare to original imaging.

**Q: Can I claim both lumbar increase AND cervical secondary?**
A: Yes, if applicable. They're different claims.

**Q: What if DDD is at multiple new levels?**
A: All new levels can be included in secondary claim.

**Q: Is DDD the same as disc herniation?**
A: DDD is degeneration; herniation is displacement. Related but distinct.
