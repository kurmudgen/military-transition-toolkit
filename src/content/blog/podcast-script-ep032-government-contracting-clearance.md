All actively recruit veterans. All have dedicated military recruiting programs. Your clearance plus military experience makes you priority candidate.

**How Government Contracting Works:**

Government awards contracts to companies for specific work. Company then staffs contract with cleared personnel. Positions exist as long as contract active (typically multi-year). Different from traditional employment - your job tied to contract.

Contract ends or not renewed? You find new position with same company on different contract, or move to different contractor. Cleared professionals generally move between contracts/companies based on opportunities. Market strong enough this works - demand exceeds supply.

**Job Hunting Resources:**

**ClearanceJobs.com:** Primary job board for cleared positions. Create profile, list clearance level, get matched with opportunities. Free for job seekers. Employers pay to post. Thousands of cleared jobs listed.

**Silent Professionals:** Veteran-focused cleared job board. Connects military veterans with security clearance to defense contractors. Specializes in SOF and intelligence roles but all veterans welcome.

**LinkedIn:** Set security clearance in profile. Recruiters search by clearance level. You'll get contacted. Be selective - lots of opportunities, find right fit.

**Company Career Pages:** Go directly to Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon, Booz Allen career sites. Filter by clearance required. Apply directly.

**Service to Success:** Non-profit connecting veterans with cleared opportunities. Free mentorship and job placement assistance.

**Maintaining Your Clearance:**

Clearance expires if not used. Typically expires 2 years after leaving cleared position. Find cleared job within 2 years and clearance reactivates without full reinvestigation (just update). After 2 years, need full reinvestigation - expensive and time-consuming for employer.

Priority: Find cleared position quickly after separation to maintain clearance validity. Don't let it lapse.

**Skills That Transfer:**

Your military experience on classified programs directly applicable. Understanding operational security, handling classified material, compartmented information, need-to-know principles - contractors need this. Can't teach it quickly. You already know it.

Leadership, mission focus, reliability, discipline - government contracting values same traits as military. Culture more relaxed than military but professionalism and security consciousness required. You adapt easily.

**Reality Check:**

Government contracting can feel mercenary - you're on contracts, positions tied to funding, less job security than traditional employment. But cleared market strong enough you find new opportunities. Cleared professionals rarely unemployed long.

Pay excellent. Benefits good (most large contractors offer full benefits). Work-life balance better than active duty. Overseas opportunities if you want them. Career progression possible within companies or moving between contracts.

Not as prestigious as some private sector roles, but compensation competitive and work often interesting (classified programs, cutting-edge technology, national security missions). Many veterans find it satisfying - still serving national security, just as contractor.

**Starting Strategy:**

**Option 1 - Leverage Clearance Immediately:** Create profiles on ClearanceJobs and LinkedIn listing clearance level and military experience. Apply to positions matching your background. Emphasize cleared status and immediate availability. Target major contractors near your location or willing to relocate to DC Metro for maximum opportunities. Timeline: 1-3 months to offers, start at separation $85K-$130K depending on clearance and role.

**Option 2 - Add Certification First:** If cybersecurity, get Security+ before separation ($392, 2-3 months). If program management, get PMP ($555, 3-6 months). Certification plus clearance plus military experience = $10K-$20K higher starting salary. Apply with cert in hand. Timeline: 3-6 months prep + cert, immediate hiring, $95K-$140K.

**Option 3 - SkillBridge + Contractor:** Many contractors offer SkillBridge internships. Last 180 days active duty, intern with contractor while maintaining clearance and military pay. Convert to full-time at separation. Guaranteed job, maintain clearance, prove fit with company. Timeline: 6 months internship, immediate conversion $80K-$120K.

**Clearance Expiration Timeline:**

Your clearance active as long as you're in cleared position. After separating military:
- First 2 years: Clearance "inactive" but easily reactivated with new cleared job
- After 2 years: Clearance expired, need full reinvestigation

Action: Find cleared position within 6 months of separation. Don't waste your clearance advantage.
