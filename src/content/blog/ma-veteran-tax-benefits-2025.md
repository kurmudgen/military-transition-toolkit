# Massachusetts Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Massachusetts offers strong tax benefits for veterans, though they come with unique characteristics compared to other states. If you're a veteran considering Massachusetts or already living here, understanding these benefits can help you navigate what some consider a complicated system.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Massachusetts offers veterans:

- **Military retirement pay**: 100% exempt from state income tax (no age or income limits)
- **Property tax exemption**: $400-$1,000 for 100% disabled veterans (Clause 22E); full exemption for paraplegics and blind veterans (Clause 22F)
- **HERO Act**: Allows municipalities to double exemptions and tie them to inflation
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Vehicle registration**: No registration fees for disabled veterans (HERO Act expansion)
- **Sales and excise tax exemption**: One vehicle for 100% disabled veterans with DV plates

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran in Boston**: $3,000-$6,000+ depending on property value, municipality, and vehicle exemptions.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Fully Exempt

Massachusetts fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax. Under Massachusetts General Law, noncontributory pension income or survivorship benefits received from the U.S. uniformed services are exempt from taxation.

**What this means**:
- Retire with $30,000/year military pension? Keep all of it
- Retire with $60,000/year? Still keep every penny
- No age restrictions, no income limits, no phase-outs

Massachusetts is one of only 25 states that have income tax but don't tax military retirement benefits. This puts Massachusetts in elite company despite its reputation as a high-tax state.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $150/month for a 10% rating or $3,900+/month for 100% with dependents, you won't pay a dime in taxes on it.

### Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)

SBP payments are also exempt from Massachusetts state income tax. If you're receiving military survivor benefits, Massachusetts won't tax them.

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Massachusetts operates on a flat income tax system:

- **5.0%** on most income types (wages, salaries, interest, dividends)
- **8.5%** on short-term capital gains
- **Additional 4%** surtax on income over $1 million (2023 ballot measure)

**Standard deduction**: Massachusetts doesn't use standard deductions like the federal system. Instead, it has various exemptions: $4,400 personal exemption, $1,000 per dependent.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Massachusetts** | 100% exempt | 5% flat | $400-$1,000 (varies by city) |
| Connecticut | Partial (75% exempt) | 3-6.99% | Varies by municipality |
| Rhode Island | 100% exempt | 3.75-5.99% | $2,000 credit |
| New Hampshire | N/A | No income tax | $700 credit |
| Vermont | Partial exempt | 3.35-8.75% | Varies |
| New York | 100% exempt (up to $40,000) | 4-10.9% | Varies by county |

Massachusetts' full exemption of military retirement puts it ahead of Connecticut and Vermont, though New Hampshire's lack of income tax beats everyone. However, Massachusetts significantly outpaces most states on overall veteran benefits when combined with the HERO Act.

## Property Tax Exemptions for Veterans

### Understanding Massachusetts Property Tax System

Massachusetts has some of the highest property taxes in the nation - the effective rate averages 1.13% statewide. On a $400,000 home, that's $4,520 annually. This makes property tax exemptions particularly valuable.

**However**, here's where Massachusetts gets complicated: Property tax exemptions are set by state law but can be increased by local municipalities. The HERO Act (signed August 2024) allows cities and towns to double exemptions and tie them to inflation.

### Clause 22E: 100% Disabled Veterans - $1,000 Standard Exemption

Veterans rated 100% service-connected disabled by the VA qualify for a property tax exemption under Clause 22E.

**Standard benefit**: $1,000 reduction in property tax
**HERO Act option**: Municipalities can double this to $2,000 and tie it to inflation

**Eligibility**:
- 100% service-connected disability rating from VA
- Resided in Massachusetts for 6 months before entering service, OR
- Resided in Massachusetts for 5 consecutive years before applying
- Spouses of deceased 100% disabled veterans also qualify

**Real-World Examples**

**Boston (Suffolk County)**
- Home value: $800,000
- Property tax rate: 1.04%
- Annual property tax: $8,320
- **Standard exemption: $1,000**
- **If Boston doubles (HERO Act): $2,000**
- Percentage saved: 12-24%

**Worcester (Worcester County)**
- Home value: $375,000
- Property tax rate: 1.75%
- Annual property tax: $6,563
- **Standard exemption: $1,000**
- **If city doubles: $2,000**
- Percentage saved: 15-30%

**Springfield (Hampden County)**
- Home value: $220,000
- Property tax rate: 2.08%
- Annual property tax: $4,576
- **Standard exemption: $1,000**
- **If city doubles: $2,000**
- Percentage saved: 22-44%

**Cambridge (Middlesex County)**
- Home value: $950,000
- Property tax rate: 0.73%
- Annual property tax: $6,935
- **Standard exemption: $1,000**
- **If city doubles: $2,000**
- Percentage saved: 14-29%

### Clause 22F: Full Exemption for Paraplegics and Blind Veterans

Veterans with specific disabilities receive **full property tax exemption** under Clause 22F:

**Qualifying conditions**:
- Paraplegics (service-connected)
- 100% disability for service-connected blindness

**No cap on property value. No annual dollar limit.**

This is Massachusetts' most generous property tax benefit for veterans - if you qualify, you pay zero property taxes on your primary residence.

### HERO Act Changes (August 2024)

The HERO Act created two critical local options:

**Option 1: Double the exemption**
Municipalities can double veteran property tax exemptions (including Clause 22E) without doubling other exemption categories.

**Option 2: Tie to inflation**
Municipalities can index exemptions to inflation, so they increase annually with cost of living.

**Implementation**: Each city/town votes separately on adoption. Contact your local assessor to determine if your municipality has adopted either option.

### Application Process

**Required documents**:
- VA rating decision letter showing 100% disability
- Driver's license showing Massachusetts residency
- Property deed or mortgage statement
- Completed exemption application (varies by municipality)

**Where to apply**: Your city or town assessor's office

**Major city assessor offices**:

- **Boston**: (617) 635-4287
- **Worcester**: (508) 799-1140
- **Springfield**: (413) 787-6130
- **Cambridge**: (617) 349-4343
- **Lowell**: (978) 674-4044
- **Brockton**: (508) 580-7226
- **Quincy**: (617) 376-1140

**Deadline**: Most municipalities require applications by April 1 for the current fiscal year. **You must reapply annually** - exemptions are not automatic.

### Partial Disability Ratings

Massachusetts does not offer graduated property tax exemptions for disability ratings below 100%. If you're rated 90%, 70%, or any percentage under 100%, you don't qualify for Clause 22E or 22F.

However, you still benefit from:
- Zero state income tax on military retirement
- Tax-free VA disability compensation
- Vehicle registration benefits (HERO Act)

## Vehicle Registration Benefits (HERO Act)

### Disabled Veterans - No Registration Fees (Expanded August 2024)

Previously, disabled veterans could only apply registration fee exemptions to one vehicle. The HERO Act removed this limit.

**Current benefit**: Disabled veterans pay **no registration fees** for any/all vehicles registered in their name

**Eligibility**: Veterans with 100% disability rating or deemed unemployable due to service-connected disability

**Annual savings per vehicle**: $60-$120 depending on vehicle type

**Example**: If you own three vehicles, you save $180-$360 annually on registration fees

### Sales and Excise Tax Exemption

100% disabled veterans can exempt **one passenger vehicle or pickup truck** from:

- Sales tax (6.25% Massachusetts sales tax)
- Excise tax (annual motor vehicle excise)

**Requirement**: You must obtain Disabled Veteran (DV) license plates for the vehicle

**Example savings**:
- Purchase price: $30,000
- Sales tax exemption: $1,875 (one-time)
- Annual excise tax: ~$450 (varies by value and age)
- **Total savings over 5 years**: ~$4,125

### Driver's License Fee Exemption

All disabled veterans (100% or unemployable) are exempt from:
- Passenger driver's license transaction fees
- License renewal fees

**Annual savings**: $50 every 5 years ($10/year average)

### Disabled Veteran License Plates

Massachusetts offers DV plates to veterans with:
- Minimum 60% service-connected disability rating
- Permanent disabled parking privileges

DV plates provide:
- Disabled parking access
- Sales/excise tax exemption eligibility
- Visual recognition

**Application**: Through RMV with VA rating documentation

## Other Financial Benefits

### Hunting and Fishing Licenses

Massachusetts offers reduced-cost licenses for disabled veterans:

- **100% disabled veterans**: Significant discounts on lifetime licenses
- **Purple Heart recipients**: Special license rates
- **Former POWs**: Reduced fees

**Lifetime Sportsman License** typically costs $500+ for residents. Disabled veterans can receive substantial discounts.

**Contact**: Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife: (617) 626-1500

### Sales Tax

Massachusetts does not offer blanket sales tax exemptions for veterans on general purchases. The state sales tax rate of 6.25% applies to most goods (clothing under $175 is exempt for everyone).

Exception: 100% disabled veterans can exempt one vehicle (as noted above).

### State Parks

Massachusetts offers free or reduced admission to state parks for disabled veterans:

- Annual state park pass: $60 (may be waived for disabled veterans at some locations)
- Contact individual parks for veteran policies

### Education Benefits (Covered in Separate Guide)

While not tax benefits per se, Massachusetts offers substantial education benefits:

- **Purple Heart Tuition Waiver**: 125% of required credit hours
- **In-state tuition**: For GI Bill users at all public schools

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran in Massachusetts vs. other Northeastern states.

### Scenario: O-3 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $45,000
- VA disability: $45,000 (100% with dependents)
- Total: $90,000

**Home**: $450,000 (median for Massachusetts metro areas)

**Vehicles**: Two passenger vehicles

### Massachusetts Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax exemption ($1,000) | $1,000 | $20,000 |
| Military retirement (vs 5% state tax) | $2,250 | $45,000 |
| Vehicle registration (2 vehicles) | $180 | $3,600 |
| Driver's license fees | $10 | $200 |
| Vehicle sales tax (one-time) | - | $1,875 |
| Vehicle excise tax (20 years) | $450 | $9,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$3,890** | **$79,675** |

**Note**: If municipality doubles property tax exemption under HERO Act, add another $20,000 over 20 years for total savings of **$99,675**.

### Comparison: Massachusetts vs. Connecticut

Same scenario, but in Connecticut (which partially exempts military retirement):

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Massachusetts | $20,000 | $45,000 | $79,675 |
| Connecticut | Varies | $11,250 (only 75% exempt) | ~$50,000 |

**Massachusetts advantage: $29,675 over 20 years**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?

Yes. Unlike some states, Massachusetts requires annual reapplication for property tax exemptions. Most municipalities send renewal notices, but it's your responsibility to submit by the April 1 deadline.

### What if my municipality hasn't adopted the HERO Act doubling provision?

Contact your town selectmen, city council, or mayor's office. The HERO Act enables doubling, but each municipality must vote to adopt it. Veteran advocacy at local town meetings can make a difference.

### Can I get the property tax exemption on a second home or rental property?

No. The exemption applies only to your primary residence.

### What if I'm rated 100% but not Permanent & Total?

You still qualify for Clause 22E benefits as long as you maintain the 100% rating. The law requires "100% service-connected disability" but doesn't specifically require P&T designation.

### Does the 6-month residency requirement mean I lived here before joining the military?

Yes, OR you must have lived in Massachusetts for 5 consecutive years before applying for the exemption. This allows veterans who relocate to Massachusetts after service to eventually qualify.

### Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption?

Yes. Unremarried surviving spouses of 100% disabled veterans qualify for the same exemptions under Clause 22E.

### What happens if I sell my home and buy another in Massachusetts?

You'll need to reapply for the exemption with your new city/town assessor. Bring:
- Your VA rating letter
- New property documentation
- Massachusetts driver's license
- Previous exemption approval (helpful but not required)

### Are military retirement benefits taxed if I move to Massachusetts from another state?

No. As long as you establish Massachusetts residency, all military retirement pay is exempt from state income tax regardless of where you served or previously lived.

### How does the vehicle excise tax exemption work?

The excise tax is an annual tax based on your vehicle's value. For 100% disabled veterans with DV plates, one vehicle is fully exempt. Apply through your city/town tax collector's office with proof of DV registration.

### Will these benefits affect my federal taxes?

No. Property tax exemptions and state income tax exemptions don't impact your federal tax liability. Military retirement and VA disability compensation remain tax-free at the federal level regardless of state benefits.

### What if my city denies my exemption application?

You have the right to appeal. Contact:
- **Massachusetts Department of Veterans Services**: (617) 210-5480
- Your local Veterans Service Officer (every city/town has one)
- State legislators

You can also request a hearing before the local board of assessors.

### Does Massachusetts tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, at the 5% flat rate. Qualified retirement account withdrawals are treated as regular income. However, this is still lower than many neighboring states.

### Can I claim both Clause 22E and Clause 22F?

No. Clause 22F provides a full exemption for paraplegics and blind veterans - it supersedes 22E. If you qualify for 22F, use that instead.

## Key Takeaways

Massachusetts delivers real financial value for veterans, though it requires proactive management:

1. **All military retirees** save $2,000-$3,000 annually through full exemption of retirement pay
2. **100% disabled veterans** save $3,000-$6,000+ annually through combined tax benefits
3. **HERO Act** significantly expanded benefits in 2024 - check if your city adopted doubling provisions
4. **Annual reapplication** required for property tax exemptions - don't miss the April 1 deadline
5. **Vehicle benefits** were massively expanded - no limit on registration fee exemptions

Combined with Massachusetts' strong healthcare system (VA Boston, VA Bedford, 7 Vet Centers) and education benefits (free tuition at Mass Maritime for residents, Yellow Ribbon schools), these tax benefits make Massachusetts competitive despite high overall cost of living.
