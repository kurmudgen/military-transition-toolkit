[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

If you've got ringing in your ears or hearing loss from your military service, you need to file a VA claim. [pause] But here's the thing - there are major changes coming to tinnitus ratings in 2025 that could affect your benefits. If you haven't filed yet, you need to do it now. Let me explain why.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're covering VA disability claims for tinnitus and hearing loss - two of the most common conditions for military veterans. We're talking about the current rating system, the major changes coming in 2025, and how to maximize your claim before these changes take effect.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering what tinnitus and hearing loss ratings are worth right now, the evidence you need for service connection, how the changes in 2025 will affect your claim, and the specific strategy to protect your benefits. If you have ringing in your ears or trouble hearing, this episode could be worth thousands of dollars per year. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 20-22 minutes]

**Segment 1: Current Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Ratings (4 minutes)**

Alright, let's start with the basics. Tinnitus and hearing loss are two separate conditions that are rated differently by the VA.

**Tinnitus** - that's T-I-N-N-I-T-U-S - is the medical term for ringing, buzzing, hissing, or other sounds in your ears that aren't caused by external noise. It's extremely common in military veterans, especially if you've been exposed to loud noises - gunfire, explosions, aircraft, engines, heavy equipment.

The VA currently rates tinnitus at 10%, regardless of whether it affects one ear or both ears. [emphasis: "10% is the maximum rating for tinnitus as a standalone condition."]

That 10% rating pays $171 per month as of 2024. That's about $2,052 per year.

Now, you might think, "Jacob, that's not a lot of money." And you're right - it's not a huge amount. But here's why it matters:

First, that's $2,000 per year for the rest of your life. Over 30 or 40 years, that's $60,000 to $80,000 in total benefits.

Second, every percentage point of VA disability contributes to your total combined rating. If you have multiple conditions, that 10% for tinnitus combines with your other ratings to potentially push you to a higher overall rating level.

Third - and this is important - if you have tinnitus documented and rated, it can serve as the basis for secondary conditions. We'll talk about that in a minute.

**Hearing loss** is rated differently. Hearing loss ratings are based on specific audiometric test results - that means hearing tests where they measure the decibel levels you can hear at different frequencies.

Hearing loss can be rated from 0% to 100%, depending on severity. Most veterans with service-connected hearing loss get rated at 0% or 10%.

Wait, what? Zero percent? [pause] Yes. You can be service-connected for hearing loss at 0%, which means the VA acknowledges your hearing loss is related to your service, but they've determined it's not severe enough to warrant compensation.

Why would you file for a 0% rating? Because once you're service-connected, if your hearing gets worse over time, you can file for an increase and you don't have to prove service connection again.

A 10% rating for hearing loss pays $171 per month, same as tinnitus 10%. If you have both tinnitus and hearing loss, you get rated for both - they don't just give you one 10% rating for both conditions.

So if you have both conditions service-connected at 10% each, you get 20% combined, which pays $338 per month or about $4,000 per year.

Higher ratings for hearing loss - 20%, 30%, 40%, etc. - require more severe hearing loss documented on audiometric testing. Most veterans don't qualify for higher than 10% unless they have significant hearing impairment.

**Segment 2: The 2025 Changes to Tinnitus Ratings - Why You Need to File NOW (5 minutes)**

Alright, here's the big issue I mentioned at the beginning. [emphasis: "The VA is planning major changes to how tinnitus is rated, and these changes are bad for veterans."]

The proposed changes are expected to take effect in 2025, possibly mid-year.

Here's what's changing:

**Current rule:** Tinnitus can be rated as a standalone condition at 10%. If you have tinnitus, you file a claim, you get service-connected, you get 10%.

**Proposed new rule:** Tinnitus will only be rated if you also have compensable hearing loss.

Let me explain what that means. Under the new rule:
- If you have tinnitus AND you have hearing loss rated at 10% or higher, you only get rated for the hearing loss. You don't get a separate rating for tinnitus.
- If you have tinnitus AND you have hearing loss rated at 0% (non-compensable), then you could get rated 10% for tinnitus.
- If you have tinnitus with NO hearing loss, you would get 0% for tinnitus - meaning no compensation.

This is a massive change. Right now, millions of veterans are receiving 10% for tinnitus as a standalone condition. Under the new rule, many of those claims wouldn't qualify for compensation.

**But here's the key:** [emphasis: "If you're already receiving a tinnitus rating when the new rule takes effect, you're grandfathered in. They will not reduce your existing rating."]

This means if you have tinnitus and you haven't filed a claim yet, you need to file NOW, before the new rule takes effect.

Even if you separated years ago, you can still file. There's no time limit on filing an initial disability claim. If you have tinnitus that you believe is related to your military service, file the claim now while the current rules are still in effect.

Let me be very clear about this timeline. The proposed rule changes were published in 2024. The VA is going through a comment and review period. The changes are expected to be finalized and implemented sometime in 2025.

We don't have an exact date yet. But the safest move is to file your claim as soon as possible, ideally before mid-2025.

If you file your claim in early 2025 and it gets processed after the rule change takes effect, you should still be evaluated under the old rule because your claim was filed before the change. But to be safe, file sooner rather than later.

This is not something to wait on. If you have tinnitus, file your claim now.

**Segment 3: Evidence Requirements for Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Claims (5 minutes)**

Alright, so you're going to file your tinnitus and/or hearing loss claim. What evidence do you need?

For both conditions, you need three things - sound familiar? These are the same three requirements for any VA disability claim:

1. Current diagnosis
2. In-service event, injury, or exposure
3. Medical nexus linking the condition to your service

Let's break these down for tinnitus and hearing loss specifically.

**For Tinnitus:**

**Current diagnosis:** You need a healthcare provider to diagnose you with tinnitus. This can be your VA primary care doctor, a VA audiologist, or a private doctor.

The diagnosis goes in your medical records. When you file your VA claim, the VA will see this in your records or you can submit it with your claim.

**In-service event/exposure:** You need to show that you were exposed to loud noises during your military service.

This is usually easy for combat veterans, especially Army and Marines. If you deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, if you were around gunfire and explosions, that's obvious noise exposure.

It's also easy for certain MOSs and ratings:
- Artillery - 13 series for Army
- Infantry - 11 series for Army, 03 for Marines
- Armor - tanks and armored vehicles
- Aviation - aircraft mechanics, flight line, aircrew
- Navy - engine rooms, flight deck operations
- Any MOS that involves heavy equipment, weapons ranges, or loud machinery

Even if you weren't combat arms, if you qualified at ranges, if you worked around loud equipment, if you were on ships or aircraft - that's noise exposure.

You don't need to prove a specific incident where you injured your ears. Cumulative noise exposure over time is sufficient.

**Medical nexus:** This is the link between your military noise exposure and your current tinnitus.

Usually, this comes from your C&P exam. The VA examiner will ask about your noise exposure during service and will provide an opinion about whether your tinnitus is at least as likely as not related to your service.

If the C&P examiner provides a favorable nexus opinion, you're likely going to get service-connected.

If they don't, or if they provide an unfavorable opinion, you might need to get an independent medical opinion from a private provider.

**For Hearing Loss:**

**Current diagnosis:** You need audiometric testing showing hearing loss. The VA uses specific criteria to evaluate hearing loss based on your hearing thresholds at different frequencies.

You'll get this testing as part of your C&P exam, so you don't necessarily need to get separate hearing tests beforehand. But if you've already had hearing tests that show hearing loss, submit those with your claim.

**In-service event/exposure:** Same as tinnitus - you need to show noise exposure during service. It's often the same exposure that caused your tinnitus.

**Medical nexus:** Again, usually comes from your C&P exam. The audiologist or examiner will review your service records, your noise exposure, and your current hearing test results, and provide an opinion about service connection.

**Important note about service medical records:**

If you were treated for ear problems, hearing issues, or tinnitus while you were in service, that's powerful evidence. It shows the condition started during your service.

Look for:
- Sick call visits for ear pain, hearing problems, or ringing in ears
- Hearing tests (audiograms) done during service
- Profile or medical waivers related to hearing
- Any documentation of ear injuries or acoustic trauma

If you don't have in-service treatment records, that's okay - many veterans don't. The condition might not have been bad enough to seek treatment while you were in, or you might have just dealt with it. You can still get service-connected based on your noise exposure and current diagnosis.

**Segment 4: The C&P Exam for Tinnitus and Hearing Loss (4-5 minutes)**

Once you file your claim, the VA will schedule you for a Compensation and Pension exam. This exam will be with an audiologist or hearing specialist.

Here's what happens during the exam:

**Part 1: Review of your claim and medical history**

The examiner will review your service records and your current medical records. They'll ask about your noise exposure during service - what was your MOS, were you in combat, what loud noises were you exposed to?

Be specific. Don't just say "I was in the Army." Say "I was 11B infantry, I deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, I was exposed to gunfire, IED explosions, and helicopter noise regularly."

**Part 2: Discussion of your tinnitus symptoms**

If you're claiming tinnitus, they'll ask:
- Do you hear ringing, buzzing, hissing, or other sounds in your ears?
- Is it in one ear or both?
- Is it constant or intermittent?
- How loud is it?
- Does it interfere with your sleep, concentration, or daily activities?

[emphasis: "Be honest about how tinnitus affects you."] If you have constant ringing that makes it hard to concentrate or sleep, tell them that. Don't minimize your symptoms.

**Part 3: Hearing test (audiogram)**

They'll conduct a comprehensive hearing test. You'll sit in a soundproof booth wearing headphones, and you'll press a button when you hear tones at different frequencies and volumes.

They test multiple frequencies - usually 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4000 Hz - in each ear.

Your results get plotted on an audiogram, which shows your hearing thresholds. The VA uses these results to determine if you have ratable hearing loss and what percentage to assign.

**Part 4: Speech recognition testing**

They'll also test your ability to understand speech. They'll play recorded words at different volumes and ask you to repeat what you heard.

This tests functional hearing - can you actually understand speech, or is your hearing loss interfering with communication?

**Part 5: Examiner's opinion**

After the exam, the audiologist will complete a DBQ - Disability Benefits Questionnaire - providing their medical opinion about:
- Whether you have tinnitus (yes/no)
- Whether you have hearing loss and at what levels
- Whether these conditions are at least as likely as not related to your military service

This opinion is critical. This is what the VA rater uses to make their decision.

**Tips for your exam:**

**First:** Attend the exam. Don't miss it. If you miss your C&P exam without a good reason, the VA can deny your claim.

**Second:** Be honest. Describe your symptoms accurately. If your tinnitus is bad, say so. If it's mild but annoying, say that. Don't exaggerate, but don't downplay.

**Third:** If you have trouble hearing during the exam, say so. If the examiner is talking and you can't hear them clearly, tell them. This documents your functional hearing problems.

**Fourth:** Take the hearing test seriously. Listen carefully for the tones. Some tones will be very faint - that's intentional. Press the button as soon as you hear a tone.

**Fifth:** Bring any supporting documentation with you - service medical records, buddy statements, private medical records. The examiner may or may not review them, but they go in your claims file.

**Segment 5: Secondary Conditions and Maximizing Your Total Rating (3-4 minutes)**

Alright, here's an advanced strategy. Tinnitus and hearing loss can lead to secondary conditions that are also ratable.

A secondary condition is a condition that's caused by a service-connected condition.

For example:

**Sleep problems:** If your tinnitus is so bad that it keeps you awake at night or disrupts your sleep, you might be able to claim sleep apnea or insomnia as secondary to tinnitus.

**Mental health conditions:** Chronic tinnitus can contribute to anxiety, depression, or irritability. If your tinnitus is causing significant distress or affecting your mental health, you might be able to claim a mental health condition as secondary to tinnitus.

**Balance problems:** If you have hearing loss associated with inner ear damage, you might also have balance problems or vertigo. These can be claimed separately.

**Meniere's Disease:** This is a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. If you have symptoms of Meniere's, this is ratable and can be related to noise exposure.

**Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):** If you had a blast exposure or head injury that caused both tinnitus and TBI symptoms, you might be able to connect tinnitus to TBI or vice versa.

The way this works is you file for secondary service connection. You say "my tinnitus [which is already service-connected] is causing me sleep problems, and I'm claiming sleep apnea secondary to tinnitus."

You need medical evidence supporting the secondary connection - a doctor's opinion that says your sleep apnea is at least as likely as not caused or aggravated by your tinnitus.

This is how veterans with tinnitus can increase their total rating beyond the 10% for tinnitus alone. If you have tinnitus at 10%, hearing loss at 10%, and sleep apnea secondary to tinnitus at 50%, those combine to a higher total rating.

I'm not going to go deep into combined ratings math in this episode - that's a topic for another day - but just know that multiple conditions combine in a way that increases your total disability percentage.

The key takeaway: don't just file for tinnitus and stop. Consider what other conditions might be related to your tinnitus or hearing loss, and file claims for those as well.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap.

Tinnitus is currently rated at 10% maximum as a standalone condition. That's $171 per month or about $2,000 per year. Hearing loss is rated from 0% to 100% based on audiometric testing, with most veterans getting 0% or 10%.

Major changes are coming to tinnitus ratings in 2025. Under the new rule, tinnitus will only be rated if you have non-compensable hearing loss (0%) or if you have no other ratable hearing condition. If you have tinnitus and compensable hearing loss, you only get rated for the hearing loss.

[emphasis: "If you have tinnitus and you haven't filed a claim yet, file NOW before the rule changes take effect."] If you're already rated for tinnitus, you're grandfathered in and your rating won't be reduced.

For service connection, you need a current diagnosis, evidence of noise exposure during service, and a medical nexus. The C&P exam with an audiologist is critical - be honest about your symptoms and take the hearing test seriously.

Consider secondary conditions like sleep problems, mental health issues, or balance disorders that might be related to your tinnitus or hearing loss.

[SHOW NOTES]

**Episode Description:**

Tinnitus and hearing loss are two of the most common VA disability claims for military veterans. But major changes are coming to tinnitus ratings in 2025 that could eliminate compensation for many future claimants. This episode breaks down the current rating system, explains the proposed rule changes and why they're bad for veterans, and provides the specific strategy to protect your benefits by filing your claim NOW before the changes take effect. Host Jacob covers evidence requirements for service connection, what happens during your C&P audiology exam, and how to maximize your total rating by filing for secondary conditions related to tinnitus. Whether you have ringing in your ears from gunfire, explosions, aircraft noise, or other military exposures, this episode could be worth thousands of dollars per year in benefits.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Tinnitus currently rated at flat 10% ($171/month, ~$2,000/year) regardless of one or both ears affected
- Hearing loss rated 0%-100% based on audiometric testing; most veterans get 0% or 10%
- 0% service-connected rating provides no monthly pay but establishes service connection for future increases
- If service-connected for both tinnitus (10%) and hearing loss (10%), you get 20% combined rating ($338/month)
- CRITICAL: VA changing tinnitus ratings in 2025 - will eliminate standalone compensation for tinnitus
- New rule (2025): Tinnitus only rated if you have non-compensable hearing loss (0%); if hearing loss is 10%+, no separate tinnitus rating
- Veterans currently receiving tinnitus ratings will be grandfathered in - existing ratings won't be reduced
- FILE NOW before rule changes take effect (expected mid-2025) to protect your benefits
- Even if you separated years ago, you can still file initial claim - no time limit
- Over 30-40 years, 10% tinnitus rating worth $60,000-$80,000 in lifetime benefits
- Three requirements: current diagnosis, in-service noise exposure, medical nexus linking condition to service
- Common noise exposures: combat (gunfire, IEDs), artillery, aviation, armor, Navy engine rooms/flight deck, weapons ranges
- Don't need specific incident - cumulative noise exposure over time is sufficient
- In-service treatment records help but aren't required - many veterans develop symptoms after service
- C&P exam conducted by audiologist includes hearing test (audiogram) at multiple frequencies
- Be honest about tinnitus severity during exam - describe impact on sleep, concentration, daily activities
- Hearing test measures thresholds at 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 3000Hz, 4000Hz in each ear
- Speech recognition testing assesses functional hearing impairment
- Missing C&P exam without good reason can result in claim denial
- Secondary conditions can increase total rating: sleep problems, anxiety, depression, balance problems, Meniere's Disease
- Sleep apnea secondary to tinnitus can be rated at 0%-100% depending on severity (common rating: 50%)
- Mental health conditions (anxiety/depression) secondary to chronic tinnitus can add significant rating percentages
- File for all related conditions, not just tinnitus - multiple conditions combine to higher total rating
