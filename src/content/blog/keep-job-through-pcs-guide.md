# How to Keep Your Job Through a PCS: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

When PCS orders arrive, your first instinct might be to start job searching for your new location. But don't assume you have to quit. Many employers are willing to **accommodate remote work or transfers** for valued employees—they just need you to make the case. This guide provides the strategies, scripts, and timeline for negotiating to keep your job through a PCS move.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Traditional approach to PCS:
1. Receive orders
2. Give notice at job
3. Move
4. Job search at new location
5. Start over

**The Problem:**
- Lost income during transition
- Career regression
- Benefits gaps
- Relationship-building starts over

**The Better Approach:**
1. Receive orders
2. Explore options with employer
3. Negotiate remote work, transfer, or transition
4. Maintain employment continuity

## Assessing Your Options

### Option 1: Remote Work Transition

**Best When:**
- Your job can be done remotely
- Company has remote work policies
- You've demonstrated reliability
- Technology supports your work

**Considerations:**
- Full remote vs. hybrid expectations
- Time zone adjustments
- Travel requirements
- Long-term sustainability

### Option 2: Internal Transfer

**Best When:**
- Company has location at new duty station
- Your role/skills needed there
- Willing to potentially change teams
- Position available or can be created

**Considerations:**
- May not be same role
- Could be different department
- May require interview process
- Salary may adjust for location

### Option 3: Contract/Consulting Arrangement

**Best When:**
- Full employment not possible
- Company still needs your skills
- Prefer flexibility
- Can handle self-employment logistics

**Considerations:**
- Loss of benefits
- Tax implications
- Less stability
- May work well as transition

### Option 4: Extended Notice Period

**Best When:**
- None of above work
- Want to leave on best terms
- Can extend timeline slightly
- Building relationship for future

**Considerations:**
- Still ends employment
- May enable referral to new location
- Maintains reference relationship
- Professional departure

## Making the Decision to Ask

### When to Definitely Ask

**Strong Indicators:**
- Your role is fully remote-capable
- Company already has remote employees
- You're a high performer
- Your skills are hard to replace
- Manager has been supportive of military life
- Company culture values flexibility

### When to Be More Cautious

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Role seems location-dependent
- Company has no remote precedent
- You're in a probationary period
- Relationship with manager is uncertain
- Company is in financial distress

**Even Then:** It rarely hurts to ask professionally. Worst case is "no."

## Preparation Before the Conversation

### Know Your Value

**Gather Evidence:**
- Performance reviews
- Key accomplishments
- Projects delivered
- Problems solved
- Skills that are hard to replace

### Research Precedents

**Find Out:**
- Does company have any remote employees?
- Have others transferred for life circumstances?
- What's the company's stated policy?
- How have similar requests been handled?

### Understand Your Role's Remote Potential

**Analyze:**
- What percentage of your work is location-independent?
- What would require adjustment?
- How would collaboration work?
- What technology is needed?

### Prepare Your Proposal

**Include:**
- Specific request (remote work, transfer, etc.)
- How it would work practically
- How you'll maintain productivity
- Proposed start date
- Willingness to be flexible

## The Conversation: Step by Step

### Step 1: Schedule a Private Meeting

**Approach:**
"I'd like to schedule some time to discuss something important with you. When would be a good time for a private conversation?"

**Timing:**
- Give as much notice as possible
- Don't ambush them in hallway
- Allow enough time for full discussion
- Avoid high-stress periods if possible

### Step 2: Share the News

**Script:**
"I wanted to let you know that my spouse has received orders to [location]. We'll be relocating in [timeframe]. I'm sharing this with you early because I value my role here and want to explore whether there's a way to continue working together."

**Key Elements:**
- Direct and clear
- Frame positively
- Show commitment to the job
- Open door to discussion

### Step 3: Make Your Request

**Script (Remote Work):**
"I'd like to propose transitioning to remote work. I've thought about how this would work, and I believe I can maintain my current level of productivity and contribution.

Here's what I'm proposing:
- [Work hours/availability]
- [Communication plan]
- [How I'll handle specific job functions]
- [Any travel I'm willing to do]

I'm open to starting with a trial period if that would help build confidence in this arrangement."

**Script (Transfer):**
"I know we have an office in [new location/nearby city]. I'd like to explore whether there's an opportunity to transfer. I understand it may not be the same role, but I'm interested in continuing my career with [Company] in whatever capacity makes sense.

Would you be able to help me explore this possibility?"

### Step 4: Handle Initial Responses

**If Positive:**
"Thank you—I really appreciate your support. What would be the next steps to formalize this arrangement?"

**If They Need Time:**
"I completely understand this requires consideration. What timeline works for getting back to me? I want to plan accordingly but am flexible on details."

**If Uncertain:**
"I understand there may be concerns. Could you share what those are so I can address them? I'm committed to making this work if there's a path forward."

**If Initially Negative:**
"I appreciate your honesty. Before we close this conversation, could I share a few thoughts on how I think it could work? I don't want to push, but I also don't want to give up without fully exploring the options."

## Handling Common Objections

### "Your role requires you to be here."

**Response:**
"I understand that perception, and I want to address it directly. Let me walk through the main components of my role:

[Component 1]: This is already done remotely/digitally
[Component 2]: This could be handled via video/collaboration tools
[Component 3]: This might require occasional travel, which I'm willing to do

I believe [X%] of my role can be done effectively from anywhere. For the remaining elements, here's how I'd propose handling them..."

### "We don't have a remote work policy."

**Response:**
"I understand I might be asking for something new. I'm not asking for a company-wide policy change—I'm asking for an individual accommodation based on my specific circumstances and performance.

Many companies have found that case-by-case arrangements work well. Would you be open to exploring this as a pilot that could help inform future decisions?"

### "What about team collaboration?"

**Response:**
"That's a valid concern, and I've thought about it carefully. Here's my plan:

- Daily check-ins via [method]
- Available during core hours [times]
- Video calls for team meetings
- Responsive on [Slack/Teams] throughout the day
- Travel back [quarterly/as needed] for key meetings

I'm committed to being even more proactive about communication since I won't have the benefit of casual office interaction."

### "We're worried about productivity."

**Response:**
"I appreciate that concern. Here's what I'd propose:

A 90-day trial period with clear performance metrics. We can set specific goals, and I'll provide regular updates on progress. If it's not working, we can reassess.

My track record shows [specific achievements]. I'm confident I can maintain that remotely, and I'm willing to prove it."

### "There might be equity issues with other employees."

**Response:**
"I understand you need to consider the broader team. My situation is somewhat unique due to the military relocation—it's not a lifestyle preference but a requirement of military family life.

Many companies have found that case-by-case accommodations for significant life circumstances don't create the same equity concerns as general policy requests."

### "I need to check with HR/leadership."

**Response:**
"Of course—I expected this would need approval beyond our conversation. A few things that might help:

I can prepare a written proposal outlining how this would work.
I'm happy to speak with HR or leadership directly if helpful.
Is there specific information that would support the decision?

What's the best next step from your perspective?"

## If the Answer is No

### Immediate Response

**Stay Professional:**
"I appreciate you considering my request and being honest with me. I understand this doesn't work for the company right now.

Could you help me understand what would need to be different for remote work to be possible in the future? And would you be open to serving as a reference as I look for my next opportunity?"

### Evaluate Your Timeline

**Consider:**
- How long until you must leave?
- Is there any flexibility in the PCS timeline?
- Can you extend at current job while searching?
- What's financial impact of unemployment gap?

### Leave Gracefully

**Give Appropriate Notice:**
- Standard is 2 weeks
- More if possible and helpful
- Offer to train replacement
- Document processes and knowledge

**Maintain the Relationship:**
- They may have opportunities later
- References matter
- Military spouse community talks
- Career paths cross again

## Alternative Outcomes to Consider

### Phased Transition

**Example:**
- Work in office until move
- Go fully remote after PCS
- Trial period with evaluation
- Planned return visits

### Part-Time/Project-Based

**Example:**
- Reduce to part-time remote
- Contract for specific projects
- Consulting arrangement
- Maintain connection without full commitment

### Internal Referral

**Example:**
- No local position, but referral to different branch
- Introduction to location at new duty station
- Recommendation within industry
- Future opportunity pipeline

## Special Situations

### Short-Notice PCS

**When Time is Limited:**
- Have conversation immediately
- Ask for quick decision
- Be prepared for no
- Focus on maintaining relationship even if job ends

### OCONUS PCS

**Additional Considerations:**
- Time zone challenges
- Legal/tax complications for employer
- Internet reliability
- May be harder sell

**Approach:**
"I know OCONUS presents additional challenges. I've researched [specific issues] and here's how they could be addressed..."

### New to the Job

**If Less Than 1 Year:**
- Acknowledge short tenure
- Emphasize quality of contribution
- More flexibility in arrangement
- Consider whether company is worth keeping

### Going Through Performance Issues

*PCS orders don't have to mean the end of your job. Many employers will work with valued employees to find solutions—but you have to ask. Prepare your case, make the request professionally, and be ready to address concerns. The worst they can say is no, and even then, you'll leave having advocated for yourself and maintained a professional relationship.*
