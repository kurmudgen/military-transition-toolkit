## Common Mistakes

**1. Not Getting CCNA Before Separation:** CCNA is THE networking certification. Air Force COOL pays 100%. Without it, you're competing with CCNA holders. Get it while free. Salary difference: $15K-$25K+.

**2. Limiting to Defense Contractors:** Commercial companies need network engineers. Tech companies, banks, healthcare pay well without clearance requirements. Don't limit yourself.

**3. Forgetting Cloud Networking:** Traditional networking alone limits growth. Cloud networking (AWS, Azure) is future. Add cloud cert within 1-2 years. Massive salary premium.

**4. Poor Technical Explanations:** Can't just say "I configured routers." Explain: "Configured BGP routing between autonomous systems, implemented OSPF for internal routing, optimized for redundancy." Show technical depth.

**5. No Home Lab:** Networking requires hands-on practice. Build lab with GNS3 or Packet Tracer. Practice configs. Put GitHub link to lab documentation on resume. Shows initiative.

## Interview Prep

**Framework:**
"I was a Cyber Transport Systems specialist—3D1X2—in the Air Force for [X] years. My role was network infrastructure: I configured Cisco routers and switches, managed firewalls, implemented network security, and maintained enterprise networks.

I worked on networks supporting [number] users, implemented VLANs for security segmentation, configured VPNs for remote access, and troubleshot complex connectivity issues. I have hands-on experience with [specific Cisco models, other equipment], routing protocols like [OSPF, EIGRP, BGP], and network security best practices.

I earned my CCNA certification [if completed] and have [X] years of practical networking experience. These skills directly transfer to corporate network engineer roles where I'd design, implement, and maintain reliable network infrastructure."

**Common Questions:**

Q: "Explain OSI model"
A: 7 layers from Physical to Application. Explain each layer's function and protocols at each level.

Q: "Troubleshoot: Users can't access internet"
A: Systematic approach: Check physical connection → verify IP configuration (ipconfig) → test gateway connectivity (ping) → check DNS (nslookup) → verify firewall rules → check routing

Q: "Difference between router and switch"
A: Routers operate at Layer 3, route between networks using IP addresses. Switches operate at Layer 2, forward within network using MAC addresses.

Q: "Design network for office building"
A: [Draw diagram]: Core switches, distribution layer, access layer switches, VLANs for segmentation, redundancy, internet connection with firewalls, wireless access points

Q: "Describe network security measures you've implemented"
A: ACLs, firewall rules, network segmentation with VLANs, VPN for remote access, wireless security (WPA2-Enterprise), IDS/IPS monitoring

**Technical Prep:**
- Know TCP/IP inside and out
- Understand routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP basics)
- Switching concepts (VLANs, STP, trunking)
- Network security (firewalls, ACLs, VPNs)
- Wireless fundamentals (802.11 standards, security)
- Practice drawing network diagrams
- Know common troubleshooting commands
