**The Numbers:** Virginia's military retirement tax exemption is decisive. A veteran with $45,000 military pension and $15,000 other income saves $2,587 annually (10-year savings: $25,870) in Maryland by choosing Virginia. Combined with lower property taxes and cost of living, 10-year total advantage exceeds $53,000.
