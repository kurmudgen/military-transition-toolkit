# New Hampshire Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

New Hampshire's best veteran tax benefit is having no general income tax—saving military retirees $2,000-$4,000+ annually. For disabled veterans, the state offers a full property tax exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans, plus a $701-$4,000 tax credit (depending on municipality). A 100% disabled veteran with a $450,000 home can save $7,000-$10,000 annually in property taxes.

New Hampshire ranks in the top 5 states nationally for veteran tax benefits. The combination of no income tax, full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans, and free vehicle registration for certain disabled veterans creates massive savings. A 100% disabled veteran with $50,000 military retirement saves approximately $12,000 annually compared to Massachusetts.

The property tax exemption structure is unique: 100% P&T disabled veterans get full exemption on their primary residence (no cap, no limit), plus many municipalities offer additional $701-$4,000 tax credits. Veterans who are double amputees, paraplegics, TDIU recipients, or blind (service-connected) also qualify for full exemption.

Downsides? New Hampshire has high property taxes generally (2nd highest nationally at $5,768 average), so the exemption is extremely valuable. If you don't qualify for the full exemption (under 100% rating), you'll pay full property tax. Also, cost of living and housing are expensive—median home prices are $480,000+ in cities like Manchester.

Overall verdict: New Hampshire is exceptional for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees, ranking among the absolute best states nationally. If you're under 100% disabled, benefits are minimal.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans (Permanent & Total):**
- Exemption: **100% of assessed property value** (full exemption, no cap)
- Additional credit: $701 standard, up to $4,000 depending on municipality
- Requirements: 100% P&T service-connected disability from VA; primary residence
- Annual savings: $7,000-$15,000+ depending on home value

If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, your primary residence is completely exempt from property taxes—period. No cap, no income limit, no restrictions. Whether your home is worth $300,000 or $1 million, you pay zero property tax.

On top of that, you get a $701-$4,000 tax credit that can apply to other property or be refunded (varies by municipality). This is the most generous property tax benefit in America.

**Alternative Qualifications for Full Exemption:**
- **100% TDIU (Individually Unemployable):** Full exemption even if your rated disability is less than 100%
- **Double amputee:** Upper or lower extremities, or any combination, service-connected
- **Paraplegic:** Service-connected
- **Blind (both eyes):** Visual acuity 5/200 or less, service-connected

**Under 100% / General Veterans:**
- Standard credit: $701 (available to some disabled veterans below 100%)
- No general veteran exemption for non-disabled veterans
- Full property tax applies

New Hampshire doesn't offer partial exemptions for 50-90% disabled veterans. It's all or nothing—full exemption at 100%, or no exemption.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local tax assessor** (Manchester, Nashua, Concord, or your town)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
   - VA award letter showing 100% P&T disability (or TDIU, or qualifying amputation/blindness)
   - Proof of New Hampshire residency
   - Property deed

3. **File application with local assessor**
   - Deadline: April 15 for most municipalities (verify with your town—some have different deadlines)
   - Processing: 30-60 days
   - Effective: Current tax year if filed by deadline

**Important:** The exemption typically renews automatically once approved. However, notify your assessor if you move or your circumstances change.

### Property Tax by County

New Hampshire has the 2nd highest property taxes nationally (average $5,768 annually). This makes the veteran exemption incredibly valuable:

| County | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Savings (100% Disabled) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Rockingham (Portsmouth) | $520,000 | 2.10% | $10,920 | $10,920 + $701 credit |
| Hillsborough (Manchester, Nashua) | $480,000 | 2.20% | $10,560 | $10,560 + $701 credit |
| Strafford | $420,000 | 2.15% | $9,030 | $9,030 + $701 credit |
| Merrimack (Concord) | $390,000 | 2.18% | $8,502 | $8,502 + $701 credit |
| Grafton | $350,000 | 2.05% | $7,175 | $7,175 + $701 credit |
| Belknap | $410,000 | 1.95% | $7,995 | $7,995 + $701 credit |

**Example:** A 100% disabled veteran with a $520,000 home in Portsmouth saves $10,920 in property taxes, plus gets a $701-$4,000 credit. Total annual savings: **$11,621-$14,920**.

Over 20 years, that's $232,000-$298,000 in tax savings.

### Municipal Tax Credits

The $701 standard credit applies statewide, but many municipalities adopt higher credits (up to $4,000). Check with your local assessor for your town's specific credit amount.

**High credit municipalities:** Some towns in Rockingham and Hillsborough counties offer $2,000-$4,000 credits. This varies year to year.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—New Hampshire has no general income tax**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $2,000-$5,000+ compared to taxing states

New Hampshire is one of eight states with no general income tax (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, and NH). Military retirement pay, civilian wages, Social Security, pensions—all tax-free at the state level.

**Example savings:**
- O-5 retiree with $60,000 pension:
  - In Massachusetts (5% rate): $3,000 state tax
  - In New Hampshire: $0
  - **Annual savings: $3,000**

- E-7 retiree with $35,000 pension:
  - In Vermont (top rate 8.75%): $3,063 state tax
  - In New Hampshire: $0
  - **Annual savings: $3,063**

**2024 Note:** New Hampshire had a 3% tax on interest and dividends over $2,400 ($4,800 joint filers) through 2024. **As of January 1, 2025, this tax is fully repealed**. New Hampshire now has zero state income tax on any income source.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt federally and in all states
- New Hampshire: Not taxed

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- New Hampshire taxation: $0 (no income tax)
- Federal: Taxed federally

Surviving spouses pay zero New Hampshire state tax on SBP payments.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Not subject to NH state tax (no income tax)
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; NH doesn't tax it either
- **Active duty pay:** Not taxed by NH if you maintain out-of-state residency under SCRA

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: **Free** for 100% P&T disabled veterans (one vehicle)
- Parking: Free parking time in any city/town when vehicle is under direct control of owner
- Annual savings: $100-$200 (registration fees) + free parking

Honorably discharged veterans classified as totally and permanently disabled get one disabled veteran license plate at no charge.

- **Totally blind veterans** (service-connected)

**Driver's License Fee Exemption:**

Free driver's license for:

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **0%** (New Hampshire has no sales tax)
- Vehicle purchases: Tax-free
- Goods and services: Tax-free

New Hampshire is one of five states with no sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon). This saves veterans hundreds to thousands annually on purchases.

**Example:** Buying a $40,000 truck:
- In Massachusetts (6.25% sales tax): $2,500 tax
- In New Hampshire: $0
- **Savings: $2,500**

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** Top tier—no income tax
- **Property tax exemption:** **#1 nationally**—full exemption with no cap is the best in America
- **Sales tax:** Top tier—no sales tax
- **Overall ranking:** **Top 3 nationally** for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees

Studies consistently rank New Hampshire in the top 3-5 states for military retirees and top 3 for disabled veterans.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- 100% P&T disabled veterans (save $10,000-$15,000+ annually)
- TDIU veterans (full exemption even if rated less than 100%)
- Double amputees, paraplegics, blind veterans (service-connected)
- Military retirees with pensions over $40,000 (save $3,000-$5,000 annually on income tax)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (MA, VT, NY, CA)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans rated 50-90% disabled (no property tax exemption)
- Veterans without military retirement income (no income tax benefit)
- Low-income veterans (high cost of living offsets tax savings)

**Better options:**
- If you're 70-90% disabled and want property tax relief, consider Texas or Oklahoma (they offer exemptions at lower ratings)
- If you want lower cost of living with similar tax benefits, consider South Dakota or Wyoming

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- New Hampshire estate tax: None (repealed 2003)
- New Hampshire inheritance tax: None
- Veteran exemptions: N/A (no estate/inheritance taxes)

New Hampshire has no estate or inheritance taxes, excellent for estate planning.

### Other Tax Benefits

**No taxes on:**
- Social Security benefits
- Military retirement
- Pension income
- 401(k)/IRA withdrawals
- Investment income (as of 2025)
- Wages/salaries
- Sales/purchases

**Taxes that do exist:**
- Real estate transfer tax (stamp tax): 1.5% of sale price (paid by seller)
- Business profits tax: 7.5% (if you own a business)
- Business enterprise tax: 0.5%

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish New Hampshire residency immediately.** Get an NH driver's license (free if you're 100% disabled), register to vote, file declaration of domicile.

2. **Apply for property tax exemption within 30 days of moving.** Don't wait—you could lose a full year of savings ($10,000+). File with your local tax assessor by April 15.

3. **Apply for disabled veteran license plates if you're 100% P&T.** Free plates, free parking—worth $200+/year.

4. **Update DFAS withholding.** Stop withholding state income tax if you're coming from another state. New Hampshire has no income tax.

5. **Buy your next car in New Hampshire.** No sales tax saves thousands.

6. **Verify your municipality's tax credit.** Some towns offer $2,000-$4,000 instead of the standard $701. Ask your assessor.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not filing property tax exemption by April 15:** You'll pay full property tax for that year. In Manchester, that's $10,560 lost.

- **Assuming partial disability qualifies:** Only 100% P&T, TDIU, double amputee, paraplegic, or blind (service-connected) get the property tax exemption. If you're 90%, you pay full tax.

- **Not claiming free vehicle registration:** 100% disabled veterans, amputees, and blind veterans get free registration and plates. Don't pay if you qualify.

- **Paying Massachusetts income tax after moving:** Establish NH residency clearly (license, voting, domicile declaration) to avoid MA trying to tax you.

- **Not notifying assessor of move:** If you move within NH, reapply for exemption in new municipality.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I pay state income tax on my military retirement in New Hampshire?**

A: No. New Hampshire has no general income tax. Military retirement, wages, pensions, Social Security—nothing is taxed at the state level.

**Q: What's the difference between the property tax exemption and the tax credit?**

A: The exemption removes your entire property from the tax roll (you pay $0). The $701-$4,000 credit is an additional benefit some municipalities offer, which can apply to other property or be refunded.

**Q: Can I get the property tax exemption if I'm 90% disabled?**

A: No, unless you also qualify as TDIU (100% due to individual unemployability). The exemption requires 100% P&T, or double amputee/paraplegic/blind (service-connected).

**Q: Does the exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. Only your primary residence qualifies.

**Q: I'm 100% P&T. Do I need to reapply every year?**

A: Usually no. Once approved, the exemption typically renews automatically. However, verify with your assessor—some towns require periodic recertification.

**Q: Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption if I die?**

A: Yes. The exemption transfers to an unremarried surviving spouse.

**Q: I'm TDIU (rated 70% but 100% unemployable). Do I qualify?**

A: Yes! TDIU qualifies for the full property tax exemption, even though your combined rating is less than 100%.

**Q: Does New Hampshire tax Social Security benefits?**

A: No. New Hampshire has no income tax, so Social Security is not taxed.

**Q: I'm active duty stationed in New Hampshire but my home of record is Texas. Do I pay NH taxes?**

A: No. New Hampshire has no income tax anyway, but even if it did, you'd be protected under SCRA.

**Q: What if I move from one NH town to another?**

A: You need to reapply for the exemption with your new town's assessor. The exemption doesn't automatically transfer between municipalities.

**Q: Are there local income taxes in New Hampshire?**

A: No. There are no local or municipal income taxes in New Hampshire.

**Q: Do I get a property tax exemption if I'm a Purple Heart recipient but under 100% disabled?**

A: Not specifically. Purple Heart alone doesn't grant the exemption—you must be 100% P&T, TDIU, or meet the amputation/paraplegic/blindness criteria.

**Q: How much do I save on sales tax living in New Hampshire?**

A: New Hampshire has no sales tax. If you spend $25,000/year on taxable goods, you'd pay $1,500-$2,000 in sales tax in most states. In NH: $0.

**Q: Can I get both the property tax exemption and free vehicle registration?**

A: Yes, if you qualify for both (100% P&T qualifies for property exemption, and if you're also an amputee/paraplegic/blind, you get free registration).

**Q: What if I have a 100% VA rating but it's not P&T?**

A: Check if you qualify as TDIU. If you have 100% due to individual unemployability, you qualify for the exemption even if it's not P&T. Otherwise, the exemption requires P&T.
