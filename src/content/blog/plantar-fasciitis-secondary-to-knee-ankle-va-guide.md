# Plantar Fasciitis Secondary to Knee/Ankle Issues: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Well-established biomechanical connection
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-20%
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected knee/ankle condition, plantar fasciitis diagnosis, gait documentation, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate to High (60-75%) with proper documentation

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common foot conditions claimed secondary to knee and ankle disabilities. When your knee or ankle doesn't function properly, your gait changes—placing abnormal stress on the plantar fascia and leading to inflammation and chronic pain.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For plantar fasciitis secondary to knee/ankle condition:
- Your knee or ankle condition must already be service-connected
- You must have diagnosed plantar fasciitis
- Medical evidence must link your plantar fasciitis to your knee/ankle condition

## How Plantar Fasciitis Relates to Knee/Ankle Conditions

### Biomechanical Connection

**Gait Alteration:**
- Limping changes how your foot strikes the ground
- Altered heel strike pattern stresses plantar fascia
- Shortened stride affects push-off mechanics
- Weight shift changes foot loading

**Ankle-Specific Mechanisms:**
- Limited ankle dorsiflexion increases plantar fascia strain
- Tight Achilles from ankle guarding pulls on plantar fascia
- Ankle instability creates compensatory foot pronation
- Subtalar compensation stresses arch

**Knee-Specific Mechanisms:**
- Knee pain causes altered stance phase
- Quadriceps weakness affects foot mechanics
- Knee stiffness changes stride length
- Compensatory gait stresses entire lower chain

**Muscle Chain Involvement:**
- Calf muscle tightness from compensation
- Tight gastrocnemius/soleus increases fascia strain
- Hip and back compensation affects foot
- Entire kinetic chain involved

### Common Progression

**Months 1-12 after knee/ankle injury:**
- Occasional heel discomfort
- Morning stiffness in heel
- Pain after prolonged standing
- May dismiss as unrelated

**Months 12-24:**
- Persistent heel pain develops
- Classic "first step" pain in morning
- Pain with walking
- Arch discomfort

**Months 24-36:**
- Chronic plantar fasciitis established
- Daily symptoms
- May develop heel spur
- Significant impact on walking

**Beyond 36 months:**
- Resistant to conservative treatment
- May require advanced intervention
- Combined disability significantly limiting

### Prevalence

- **30-50%** of chronic lower extremity injury patients develop plantar fasciitis
- **Gait abnormalities** strongly associated with plantar fasciitis
- **Limited ankle dorsiflexion** is primary risk factor
- Veterans with knee/ankle conditions have **elevated** plantar fasciitis rates
- Both ipsilateral and contralateral feet can be affected

## VA Rating Criteria for Plantar Fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis is typically rated under 38 CFR § 4.71a:

**Diagnostic Code 5284 - Other Foot Injuries:**
| Rating | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Moderate |
| 20% | Moderately severe |
| 30% | Severe |
| 40% | With actual loss of use of foot |

**Key Factors for Rating:**
- Pain frequency and severity
- Impact on walking/standing
- Treatment required
- Functional limitation

Most plantar fasciitis cases receive **10-20%** rating.

**Alternative Codes:**
- DC 5276 (Flatfoot) if arch collapse present
- DC 5003 (Arthritis) if heel spur with painful motion

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition (Knee or Ankle)
- Service connection documentation
- Current rating
- Treatment records
- Gait abnormality documentation
- Range of motion limitations

#### For Your Secondary Condition (Plantar Fasciitis)
- Formal diagnosis of plantar fasciitis
- Foot X-rays (may show heel spur)
- Treatment records
- Podiatry evaluations
- Orthotic prescriptions

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Podiatrist or orthopedist
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Plantar fasciitis diagnosis**
4. **Causal statement** - "At least as likely as not" language
5. **Gait/biomechanical explanation** - How knee/ankle condition caused plantar fasciitis

**Example Nexus Language (Knee):**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records. [Veteran] is service-connected for right knee degenerative joint disease at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] has been diagnosed with right plantar fasciitis, confirmed by physical examination revealing tenderness at the medial calcaneal tubercle and pain with dorsiflexion of the great toe.*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] plantar fasciitis is at least as likely as not (50% probability or greater) caused by the service-connected knee condition.*

*Biomechanical Rationale: [Veteran's] knee condition has resulted in altered gait mechanics documented in physical therapy records. The compensatory gait pattern—including shortened stride and altered foot strike—places abnormal stress on the plantar fascia. Additionally, guarding of the knee has caused calf muscle tightness, which directly increases strain on the plantar fascia through the Achilles tendon attachment.*

*Medical literature establishes that lower extremity dysfunction leads to plantar fasciitis through altered loading patterns (Riddle et al., 2003)."*

**Example Nexus Language (Ankle):**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for left ankle chronic instability at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] has been diagnosed with left plantar fasciitis.*

*It is my medical opinion that [Veteran's] plantar fasciitis is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected ankle condition.*

*The ankle condition has limited ankle dorsiflexion to [X] degrees (normal 20+ degrees). Limited dorsiflexion is one of the strongest risk factors for plantar fasciitis, as the foot must compensate for restricted ankle motion. This compensation increases strain on the plantar fascia with each step.*

*Additionally, [Veteran's] ankle instability has caused compensatory foot pronation, further stressing the arch and plantar fascia."*

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No documentation of gait connection** - Must show how knee/ankle affects walking

2. **Vague diagnosis** - Get specific plantar fasciitis diagnosis from podiatrist

3. **Missing the morning pain pattern** - Document classic "first step" pain

4. **Not claiming both feet** - If both affected, claim both

5. **No treatment records** - Show you've sought treatment

6. **Forgetting orthotics evidence** - Prescription orthotics supports claim

7. **Missing ankle ROM documentation** - Limited dorsiflexion is key risk factor

8. **Not explaining the mechanism** - Nexus must explain HOW condition developed

9. **Ignoring contralateral foot** - Other foot may be affected from overloading

10. **Waiting until severe** - File when symptoms begin

## Medical Research Supporting Connection

**Key Studies:**

- **Riddle et al. (2003)** - Identified limited ankle dorsiflexion as primary risk factor for plantar fasciitis

- **Irving et al. (2006)** - Systematic review confirming biomechanical factors in plantar fasciitis

- **Pohl et al. (2009)** - Demonstrated gait abnormalities contribute to plantar fasciitis

**Biomechanical Principles:**
- Limited ankle dorsiflexion (<10°) strongly associated with plantar fasciitis
- Abnormal pronation increases plantar fascia strain
- Tight gastrocnemius-soleus complex pulls on fascia
- Altered gait from any cause can lead to plantar problems

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I had plantar fasciitis before my knee/ankle condition?**
A: If knee/ankle aggravated pre-existing plantar fasciitis, you can claim aggravation.

**Q: Can I claim plantar fasciitis secondary to back condition?**
A: Yes, if back affects your gait. The mechanism is the same.

**Q: Is heel spur the same as plantar fasciitis?**
A: Heel spurs can develop from chronic plantar fasciitis. Both can be documented.

**Q: What if my plantar fasciitis comes and goes?**
A: Document the pattern. Chronic/recurrent plantar fasciitis is still ratable.

**Q: Do I need X-rays?**
A: X-rays aren't required for diagnosis but can show heel spurs supporting chronicity.

**Q: Can orthotics help my claim?**
A: Orthotics prescription supports that you have a condition requiring treatment.

**Q: What's the highest rating for plantar fasciitis?**
A: 30% for severe foot injury; most plantar fasciitis cases rate 10-20%.

**Q: Can I claim both feet from one knee injury?**
A: Yes, explain both ipsilateral (same side compensation) and contralateral (opposite side overloading) mechanisms.
