## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 35F Intelligence Analysts transitioning out—your skills are in serious demand. Your **all-source intelligence analysis, threat assessment capabilities, intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB), analytical writing, critical thinking, Top Secret/SCI clearance, and proven ability to synthesize complex information from multiple sources** make you one of the most marketable professionals in both government and private sectors. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$75,000-$105,000** with federal agencies or entry-level contractor positions, scaling to **$110,000-$165,000** with mid-career defense contractor roles, and **$150,000-$200,000+** for senior intelligence positions or specialized roles. Your security clearance alone is worth **$20,000-$40,000** in additional salary premium. The intelligence community is actively hiring—choose strategically and leverage your clearance while it's active.

As a 35F, you didn't just "look at maps and write reports." You conducted all-source intelligence analysis integrating HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, OSINT, and MASINT. You briefed commanders on enemy capabilities and intentions. You identified patterns in complex data that others missed. You produced intelligence products under extreme time pressure that directly influenced tactical and operational decisions. You maintained rigorous classification protocols and handled some of the military's most sensitive information. That's strategic analysis, critical thinking, briefing executive leadership, and security expertise—skills that translate directly to six-figure civilian careers.

The key: target employers who understand intelligence work and value your clearance. Three-letter agencies (CIA, DIA, NSA, FBI), major defense contractors (Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, CACI, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman), and cleared positions pay premium salaries for exactly what you've been doing. Don't waste time convincing corporate America what an intelligence analyst does—go where they already know and will pay accordingly.

## What Does a 35F Intelligence Analyst Do?

As a 35F, you were responsible for analyzing intelligence information from multiple sources (signals intelligence, human intelligence, imagery, etc.) to assess enemy forces, terrain, and weather conditions. You conducted intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB), identified threats, determined enemy courses of action, and produced intelligence estimates, summaries, and reports. You briefed commanders and staff on intelligence findings, maintained intelligence databases and files, and ensured all intelligence activities complied with laws and regulations regarding classification and handling procedures.

Your typical day involved reviewing intelligence reports from various collection disciplines, conducting pattern analysis to identify enemy activity, creating intelligence products like situation reports (SITREPs) and intelligence summaries (INTSUMs), collaborating with other intelligence professionals, and providing direct intelligence support to operational planning. You worked with classified systems, analyzed geopolitical situations, tracked threats, and translated complex intelligence into actionable recommendations for decision-makers.

This role required strong analytical skills, attention to detail, the ability to work under pressure, excellent written and oral communication, and absolute trustworthiness with classified information. You developed expertise in intelligence cycle processes, analytical methodologies, intelligence tools and databases, and military/geopolitical analysis.

## Top Civilian Career Paths for 35F Intelligence Analysts

### Federal Intelligence Agencies (highest mission alignment)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Intelligence Analyst (CIA, DIA, NSA, NGA)
- All-Source Analyst (FBI, DHS, DEA)
- Counterterrorism Analyst (NCTC, FBI)
- Targeting Analyst (CIA, DIA)
- Intelligence Officer (DIA, State Department)
- Regional Analyst (CIA, DIA, State Department)
- Threat Analyst (FBI, DHS)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level Intelligence Analyst (GS-9 to GS-11):** $60,000-$85,000 base + locality pay (DC adds 30%+) = $78,000-$110,000 total
- **Mid-career Intelligence Analyst (GS-12 to GS-13):** $85,000-$115,000 + locality = $110,000-$150,000
- **Senior Intelligence Analyst (GS-14 to GS-15):** $115,000-$155,000 + locality = $150,000-$200,000+
- **CIA Intelligence Officer:** $90,000-$160,000+ depending on grade and assignment
- **FBI Intelligence Analyst:** $78,000-$136,000 depending on experience level

**What translates directly:**
- All-source intelligence analysis and fusion
- Intelligence reporting and product creation
- Threat assessment and pattern analysis
- Classification protocols and security procedures
- Intelligence cycle management
- Briefing executive leadership
- Regional and geopolitical expertise
- Your TS/SCI clearance (massive hiring advantage)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required for most agencies—use your GI Bill if you don't have one)
- **Active TS/SCI clearance** (you already have this—maintain it)
- **Agency-specific training** (provided after hiring—CIA is 18+ months, FBI is 12-16 weeks)
- **Polygraph clearance** (CI or full-scope depending on agency)

**Reality check:**
The hiring process is lengthy—12 to 18 months from application to start date for CIA/NSA/DIA. FBI can take 12-16 months. Don't wait until you separate to apply. Start 18-24 months before your ETS date.

Your 35F experience makes you a perfect fit, but you're competing with thousands of applicants. Your active clearance and recent operational experience are differentiators. Agencies want current intelligence professionals, not people who've been out for years.

CIA and DIA actively recruit 35F analysts. NSA values 35Fs with technical backgrounds. FBI prioritizes counterterrorism and counterintelligence experience. Target agencies that match your specific expertise (regional focus, threat type, analytical specialty).

The mission is similar to what you did in uniform—serving national security—but with better work-life balance, higher pay, and no deployments (unless you choose overseas assignments). Federal benefits are excellent: pension after 20 years, TSP matching, comprehensive health insurance, and job security.

**Best for:** 35F analysts who want to continue intelligence work, serve national security missions, and prefer government stability with excellent benefits and clear career progression.

### Defense Contractor Intelligence Analysis (highest near-term pay)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Intelligence Analyst (all-source)
- Targeting Analyst
- Operations Intelligence Analyst
- Intelligence Planner
- Collection Manager
- Intelligence Briefer
- Threat Analyst
- GEOINT Analyst
- SIGINT Analyst (if you have technical background)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level contractor (1-3 years experience):** $75,000-$95,000
- **Mid-level analyst (3-7 years):** $95,000-$130,000
- **Senior analyst (7-12 years):** $130,000-$165,000
- **Lead/Principal analyst (12+ years):** $165,000-$200,000+
- **OCONUS positions:** Add 15-30% for overseas assignments

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing the exact same job as a contractor that you did in the Army, just getting paid significantly more for it.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Active TS/SCI clearance** (non-negotiable—if it lapses, expect 12-18 months to reinvestigate)
- **Bachelor's degree** (often required, sometimes waived for experience)
- **Security+ or equivalent baseline certification** (many contracts require this—costs $400-600, easily obtained)
- **Specialized certifications boost pay:** GIAC, CISSP, or specialty intelligence training

**Companies actively hiring 35F analysts:**
- **Booz Allen Hamilton** (33,000+ employees, about 1/3 are military-connected)
- **Leidos** (major intelligence community contractor)
- **CACI International** (specializes in intelligence support)
- **BAE Systems** (large intel contracts)
- **Northrop Grumman** (defense and intelligence)
- **General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT)**
- **SAIC** (Science Applications International Corporation)
- **Peraton** (space, intelligence, and cyber operations)
- **ManTech International**
- **Parsons Corporation**
- **Raytheon Intelligence & Space**
- **L3Harris Technologies**
- **Amentum** (formerly AECOM)
- **PAE** (Pacific Architects and Engineers)
- **KeyW Corporation**
- **Intelligent Waves**
- **Crimson Phoenix**
- **Invertix Corporation**
- **Groundswell**
- **Serco North America**

**Reality check:**
Defense contracting is lucrative and stable—as long as the contract continues. Contracts are typically 1-5 years with options to extend. If your contract ends or isn't renewed, you're job hunting again. That said, the cleared intelligence analyst market is strong, and experienced analysts with active clearances have multiple opportunities.

Most positions are in the DC/Northern Virginia/Maryland area (the "Beltway"), but OCONUS positions exist at military bases worldwide. OCONUS can pay more but requires extended time away from home.

Contractors often work alongside government personnel doing identical work but earning 20-40% more. However, you sacrifice some job security and typically have fewer benefits than federal employees (though many contractors offer competitive benefits packages).

The work is meaningful—you're still supporting warfighters and national security—but you're now a business expense on a contract. If budgets cut or contracts change, contractors go first.

**Best for:** 35F analysts who want maximum near-term earning potential, prefer private sector flexibility over government bureaucracy, and can handle contract-to-contract employment.

### Corporate Threat Intelligence & Security Analysis

**Civilian job titles:**
- Threat Intelligence Analyst
- Cyber Threat Analyst
- Security Intelligence Analyst
- Strategic Intelligence Analyst
- Corporate Intelligence Analyst
- Competitive Intelligence Analyst
- Risk Analyst
- Geopolitical Risk Analyst

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level:** $70,000-$90,000
- **Mid-level:** $90,000-$130,000
- **Senior level:** $130,000-$180,000
- **Lead/Manager level:** $180,000-$220,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Threat assessment and analysis methodologies
- Intelligence reporting and briefings
- Pattern analysis and trend identification
- Multi-source information synthesis
- Executive-level communication
- Risk evaluation

**Companies hiring:**
- **Tech companies** (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple)
- **Financial institutions** (JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup)
- **Cybersecurity firms** (CrowdStrike, Mandiant/Google Cloud, Palo Alto Networks)
- **Consulting firms** (Deloitte, PwC, EY, Accenture)
- **Energy companies** (ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell)
- **Fortune 500 corporations** (almost all have threat intelligence functions)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (often required)
- **Security+, CISSP** (for cybersecurity threat intelligence roles)
- **Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (CTIA)** (optional but valuable)
- **Clearance helps but isn't always required** (though it's a differentiator)

**Reality check:**
Corporate intelligence is different from military/government intelligence. You're analyzing threats to the company (cyber threats, competitive threats, geopolitical risks affecting business) rather than national security threats. The work is less mission-focused and more business-focused.

The upside: better work-life balance, higher earning potential at senior levels, exposure to business strategy, and less bureaucracy. The downside: less "mission," more corporate politics, and you may need to learn business/technology concepts you didn't need in the military.

Corporate roles rarely require clearances, so your clearance matters less here. However, your analytical skills, threat assessment expertise, and ability to brief executives are highly valued.

**Best for:** 35F analysts who want private sector pay and work-life balance, are interested in business applications of intelligence, and don't need the government/defense mission to stay motivated.

### Intelligence Training & Instruction

**Civilian job titles:**
- Intelligence Instructor
- Training Developer
- Curriculum Developer
- Subject Matter Expert (SME)
- Intelligence Mentor/Advisor

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level instructor:** $65,000-$85,000
- **Senior instructor:** $85,000-$115,000
- **Lead instructor/Course manager:** $115,000-$145,000
- **Contract instructor (OCONUS):** $120,000-$180,000

**Companies hiring:**
- Defense contractors providing training support
- Military schoolhouses (civilian instructors)
- Intelligence community training programs
- Private training companies

**Best for:** 35F analysts who love teaching, have strong communication skills, and want to pass on knowledge to the next generation of intelligence professionals.

### Law Enforcement Intelligence

**Civilian job titles:**
- Intelligence Analyst (state/local/federal law enforcement)
- Fusion Center Analyst
- Crime Analyst
- Counterterrorism Analyst

**Salary ranges:**
- **Local/state:** $55,000-$80,000
- **Federal (FBI, DEA, ATF):** $78,000-$130,000

**Best for:** 35F analysts interested in domestic law enforcement who want to serve their communities with stable government employment.

## Required Certifications & Training

5. **LinkedIn** (set up alerts for "Intelligence Analyst" + "TS/SCI")
6. **Intelligence community job fairs** (GEOINT Symposium, AFCEA events)

**Recruiter Strategy:**

Cleared recruiters will find you if your LinkedIn profile is optimized. Make sure your profile includes:
- "Intelligence Analyst" in headline
- "Active TS/SCI clearance" (if still active)
- Key skills: All-Source Analysis, Threat Assessment, Intelligence Reporting
- Location: Washington DC area (even if you're not there yet—that's where the jobs are)

Companies like Booz Allen, Leidos, and CACI have dedicated military recruiting teams. Reach out directly via LinkedIn.

**Application Tips:**

For federal agencies:
- Apply to multiple agencies simultaneously (CIA, DIA, NSA, NGA, FBI)
- Tailor resume to each agency's mission
- Be patient—hiring takes 12-18 months
- Pass the polygraph (be completely honest)

For contractors:
- Apply directly on company websites AND through ClearanceJobs
- Tailor resume to specific contract requirements
- Response time is faster (2-8 weeks typically)
- Leverage veteran status (companies get veteran hiring preferences)

**Clearance is KING:**

80% of intelligence jobs require active TS/SCI. If yours lapses, you're competing with everyone. If it's active, you skip to the front of the line. Do whatever it takes to accept a cleared position within 24 months of separation to keep it active.

## Interview Preparation

### Common Interview Questions for Intelligence Analyst Positions

**1. Describe your intelligence analysis process.**

*Good Answer:* "I follow the intelligence cycle: planning and direction, collection, processing, analysis, production, and dissemination. As a 35F, I started by understanding the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIRs), then reviewed all available intelligence from HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, and open sources. I used analytical tools like DCGS-A to organize information, conducted pattern analysis to identify trends, and produced intelligence products like SITREPs and INTSUMs. Finally, I briefed findings to senior leadership and adjusted collection based on feedback. My goal was always to turn raw data into actionable intelligence that informed decisions."

**2. How do you handle conflicting intelligence from different sources?**

*Good Answer:* "Conflicting intelligence is common. I evaluate source credibility—HUMINT can be biased, SIGINT can be misinterpreted, GEOINT can lack context. I cross-reference sources, look for corroborating information, assess the reliability and access of each source, and present multiple hypotheses to leadership with confidence levels. I never cherry-pick data to fit a narrative—I present what I know, what I don't know, and what I assess with caveats. Intellectual honesty is critical in intelligence work."

**3. Tell me about a time you identified a threat others missed.**

*Quantifiable example:* "During my deployment, I noticed a pattern in IED emplacement timing and locations that didn't match typical enemy behavior. I conducted link analysis and pattern-of-life analysis on suspected facilitators and identified a new network operating in our area. I briefed this to the brigade intelligence officer, who adjusted patrol routes and surveillance. Within two weeks, we interdicted three IED emplacements, preventing potential casualties. My commanders credited this analysis with saving lives."

**4. How do you prioritize when you have multiple intelligence requirements and limited time?**

*Good Answer:* "I prioritize based on commander's critical information requirements (CCIRs), threat level, and time sensitivity. If a threat is imminent and affects force protection, it takes precedence. If there are competing long-term analytical projects, I communicate with leadership about timelines and deliverables. I'm comfortable working under pressure—I produced daily intelligence briefings during high-tempo operations where information changed hourly. I focus on what decision-makers need to know right now versus what's nice to know later."

**5. Explain your experience with classified information and security protocols.**

*Good Answer:* "I held a TS/SCI clearance for six years with zero security violations. I worked in SCIFs daily, handled SCI materials, followed strict classification guidelines, and completed annual security training. I understand need-to-know principles, proper storage and transmission of classified information, and the consequences of security violations. Security isn't just about following rules—it's about protecting sources, methods, and people's lives. I take that responsibility seriously."

**6. What intelligence tools and databases are you proficient in?**

*List specific tools:* "DCGS-A, CIDNE, Palantir, MIDB, Google Earth, Microsoft Office Suite, and various SIGINT and GEOINT tools. I'm a fast learner with new systems—I've been trained on multiple intelligence platforms and adapt quickly. I'm also comfortable with open-source intelligence tools like social media monitoring and public records databases."

**7. How do you communicate complex intelligence to non-intelligence professionals?**

*Good Answer:* "I regularly briefed commanders and staff who weren't intelligence professionals. I avoid jargon, use visuals like maps and charts, focus on 'so what' (why this matters), and tailor the message to the audience. A battalion commander needs different information than a brigade S3. I keep it concise—bottom line up front—and anticipate questions. My goal is for decision-makers to understand the threat and implications without getting lost in technical details."

**8. Describe a time you had to deliver bad news or an unpopular intelligence assessment.**

*Example:* "I assessed that an operation had a higher risk than leadership initially believed based on enemy capabilities in the area. I briefed this honestly with supporting evidence, knowing it wasn't what they wanted to hear. My job isn't to tell leadership what they want to hear—it's to provide accurate assessments so they can make informed decisions. They adjusted the plan, and the operation succeeded with lower risk. Leaders appreciate honesty, even when it's inconvenient."

**9. What's your approach to continuous learning in the intelligence field?**

*Good Answer:* "Intelligence is constantly evolving—new threats, new technologies, new methodologies. I read intelligence community publications, follow geopolitical news, take online courses, and learn from other analysts. I'm pursuing [Security+/CISSP/Master's degree] to stay current. I also believe in learning from every assignment—every deployment, every analytical challenge teaches something new. The best analysts never stop learning."

**10. Why do you want to work for [this agency/company]?**

*Tailor to the organization:*
- **For CIA/DIA/NSA:** "I want to continue serving national security at the strategic level. I've supported tactical operations; now I want to contribute to intelligence that shapes policy and strategy."
- **For FBI:** "I want to apply my intelligence skills to protect Americans at home. Counterterrorism and counterintelligence are critical missions, and I want to be part of that fight."
- **For contractors:** "I want to continue supporting the warfighter and intelligence community, and [company name] has a reputation for high-quality intelligence support and taking care of employees."

### Behavioral Interview Tips

- **Use the STAR method:** Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **Quantify results:** "Supported 50+ operations" not "supported operations"
- **Be honest about clearance/polygraph topics:** They'll find out anyway
- **Show intellectual curiosity:** Intelligence agencies want analysts who think critically, not just follow processes
- **Ask informed questions:** Research the agency/company beforehand

## Common Mistakes 35F Analysts Make in Transition

### 1. Letting Your Clearance Lapse

Your TS/SCI clearance is worth $20,000-$40,000 in salary. If it goes inactive, reinvestigation takes 12-18 months and costs $5,000-$15,000. Accept any cleared job—even short-term contract work—within 24 months to keep it active while you find your ideal position.

### 2. Waiting Until After Separation to Start Job Search

Federal agencies take 12-18 months to hire. Contractors take 2-6 months (background checks, client approval). Start applying 18 months before ETS. You should have offers before you separate, not months after.

### 3. Focusing Only on Federal Agencies

CIA/NSA/FBI are great, but they're hyper-competitive with lengthy hiring processes. Defense contractors hire faster, pay more initially, and offer similar work. Apply to both simultaneously.

### 4. Not Translating Military Experience to Civilian Terms

Civilians don't know what "35F" means. They don't know IPB, CCIR, or INTSUM. Translate everything. Use LinkedIn and resume to speak civilian language: "intelligence analyst," "threat assessment," "strategic analysis."

### 5. Undervaluing Your Experience

You're not entry-level. You've conducted real-world intelligence analysis in high-pressure environments. You've briefed senior leaders. You've handled TS/SCI materials. That's worth $80K-$100K+ starting salary, not $50K. Know your worth and negotiate accordingly.

### 6. Ignoring Education Requirements

Most federal agencies and many contractors require a bachelor's degree. If you don't have one, start immediately using your GI Bill. Don't let this preventable barrier eliminate 80% of opportunities.

### 7. Limiting Geographic Options

80% of intelligence jobs are in the DC/Northern Virginia/Maryland area. If you're unwilling to relocate there, your options are severely limited. Other hubs: Fort Meade (NSA), San Antonio, Colorado Springs, Tampa, Hawaii. Be flexible or expect fewer opportunities.
