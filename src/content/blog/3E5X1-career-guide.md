## Overview

Engineering specialists perform engineering support: drafting, surveying, construction inspection, materials testing, project management support, GIS, and technical engineering functions.

**Daily:** CAD drafting, surveying (GPS, total stations), construction inspection, materials testing (concrete, soil), project documentation, GIS mapping, cost estimating, specifications review.

## Civilian Paths

**Civil Engineering Technician:** Support civil engineers. $45K-$75K. Entry to engineering field. Can advance to engineer with degree.
**Survey Technician:** Land surveying, construction layout. $40K-$70K. Licensing path available (Professional Land Surveyor).
**CAD Drafter:** Technical drawings, engineering plans. $45K-$75K. Architecture, engineering, construction firms.
**Construction Inspector:** Verify work compliance. $50K-$85K. Government agencies, engineering firms.
**GIS Technician:** Geographic information systems. $45K-$75K. Government, utilities, environmental firms.
**Materials Testing Technician:** Soil, concrete, asphalt testing. $40K-$65K. Geotechnical firms, DOT, contractors.

## Certifications

**AutoCAD Certified Professional:** Industry-standard drafting certification. Opens CAD roles.
**Civil 3D:** Advanced civil engineering design software. Valued by engineering firms.
**NICET (Engineering Technician):** Level II-IV certifications in various specialties. Industry-recognized credential system.
**Land Surveyor-in-Training (LSIT):** First step toward Professional Land Surveyor license.

## Degree Path

Many 3E5s complete civil engineering bachelor's using TA/GI Bill while working as technician. Engineering degree transforms $45K-$75K technician salary to $70K-$110K engineer salary.

**Best Schools:**
- ABET-accredited civil engineering programs
- Online options: Arizona State, Penn State World Campus, University of Florida
- Use CCAF credits + prior learning for max transfer

## Salary

| Role | Entry | Mid | With Degree |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drafter/Tech | $40K-$55K | $55K-$75K | N/A |
| Survey Tech | $38K-$50K | $50K-$70K | $70K-$95K (PLS) |
| Inspector | $45K-$60K | $60K-$85K | N/A |
| Civil Engineer | N/A | N/A | $70K-$110K |

## Top Companies

AECOM, Jacobs, HDR, Parsons, Stantec, KCI, Terracon, local engineering firms, DOT/public works, utilities, construction companies, surveying firms.

## Action Plan

Decide specialty: Drafting (get CAD certs), Surveying (pursue PLS), Engineering (complete bachelor's degree). Engineering path offers highest ceiling but requires degree investment.

## Success Stories

**Former SSgt:** Civil engineer at consulting firm $95K. "Used TA for civil engineering degree. 3E5 experience plus degree = hired immediately."
**Former SrA:** Survey crew chief $65K working toward PLS license. "Surveying good career. Outdoor work, technical skills, licensure path."
**Former TSgt:** Senior CAD designer $75K. "Specialized in Civil 3D. Engineering firms always need skilled drafters."
