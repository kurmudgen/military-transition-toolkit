# How to Increase Your VA Disability Rating in 2025: Secondary Conditions Strategy

Let's get straight to it: the difference between a 70% VA disability rating and 100% is about $1,200/month—$14,400 per year. For a 30-year-old veteran, that's over $400,000 in lifetime benefits.

Most veterans with service-connected conditions are under-rated. Not because they're scamming the system, but because they don't understand how VA math works and they're leaving secondary conditions on the table.

If you're sitting at 50%, 60%, or 70%, there's a good chance you qualify for a higher rating right now. Here's exactly how to get it.

## The Financial Reality: Why This Matters

First, let's talk about what you're actually fighting for. Here are the 2025 monthly rates for a veteran without dependents:

| Rating | Monthly Payment | Annual Payment |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| 50% | $1,075.16 | $12,901.92 |
| 60% | $1,361.88 | $16,342.56 |
| 70% | $1,716.28 | $20,595.36 |
| 80% | $1,995.01 | $23,940.12 |
| 90% | $2,241.91 | $26,902.92 |
| 100% | $3,737.85 | $44,854.20 |

**The jump from 70% to 100% = $2,021.57/month more**

That's a car payment, a mortgage payment, or most of a rent payment—every single month, tax-free, for the rest of your life. Now add in dependents, and 100% pays $3,946.25/month for a veteran with a spouse and one child.

But here's what most veterans don't realize: going from 90% to 100% is just a 10% increase on paper, but it's a $1,495.94/month increase in actual payment. VA math is weird, and understanding it is key to maximizing your rating.

## Why Most Veterans Are Under-Rated

Three main reasons:

### 1. They Only File for Primary Conditions
You filed for the knee injury, the back pain, and the tinnitus. But did you file for:
- The hip arthritis that developed because you've been walking with a limp for 10 years?
- The depression that stems from chronic pain and limited mobility?
- The sleep apnea that's connected to your PTSD?
- The migraines triggered by your traumatic brain injury?

Those are **secondary conditions**, and they're the fastest path to increasing your rating.

### 2. Their Conditions Have Gotten Worse
That 30% back rating you got in 2018? Maybe your back is significantly worse now—limited range of motion, muscle spasms, incapacitating episodes. You're entitled to request an increase based on worsening symptoms.

### 3. They Don't Understand VA Math
VA uses "bilateral factor" for paired body parts and a funky combined rating formula that doesn't add up the way you think. A veteran with 70% PTSD + 30% back + 20% knee isn't at 120%—they're at 79%, which rounds down to 70% combined. But add a few 10% secondary conditions, and suddenly you're at 84%, which rounds up to 90%.

## The Secondary Conditions Strategy: Your Fastest Path to Increase

Secondary conditions are medical conditions caused by (or aggravated by) your already service-connected conditions. They're your secret weapon because:

1. **They don't require proving the primary condition is service-connected** (that's already done)
2. **They often qualify for their own ratings** (each can be 0%-100%)
3. **The VA is legally required to consider them** if you provide evidence
4. **They add up fast** in VA math

Here's the strategy:

### Step 1: Identify All Potential Secondary Conditions

Go through each of your service-connected conditions and ask: "What else has this caused or made worse?"

**Common secondary condition chains:**

**If you have service-connected PTSD:**
- Depression (secondary mental health)
- Sleep disorders/insomnia
- Erectile dysfunction
- Migraines/headaches
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- Bruxism (teeth grinding)

**If you have service-connected knee injury:**
- Hip arthritis (from altered gait)
- Lower back pain (from compensation)
- Ankle problems (from instability)
- Opposite knee problems (from overuse)

**If you have service-connected back pain:**
- Hip arthritis
- Sciatic nerve pain (radiculopathy)
- Depression (chronic pain)
- Sleep disorders (pain-related)

**If you have service-connected TBI:**
- Migraines/chronic headaches
- Cognitive dysfunction
- Balance/vestibular issues
- Mood disorders
- Vision problems
- Tinnitus

**If you have service-connected tinnitus:**
- Sleep disorders
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Migraines

**If you have any chronic pain condition:**
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Sleep disorders
- Sexual dysfunction

### Step 2: Get Medical Evidence

For each potential secondary condition, you need:

1. **A current diagnosis** from a doctor
2. **Medical records showing the condition** and its severity
3. **A nexus letter** linking the secondary condition to your primary service-connected condition

That last one is critical. Your doctor needs to write something like: "In my medical opinion, it is at least as likely as not that Mr. Johnson's hip arthritis is caused by the altered gait resulting from his service-connected left knee injury."

(See our [complete guide to nexus letters](/blog/va-nexus-letter-complete-guide) for more on this.)

### Step 3: File a Claim for Each Secondary Condition

Use VA Form 21-526EZ (the same form as your original claim) and select "new condition" for each secondary condition. In the remarks section, explicitly state: "Filing for [condition] secondary to service-connected [primary condition]."

Upload:
- Current medical records
- Treatment records showing ongoing care
- Nexus letter from a qualified provider
- Your personal statement explaining how the primary condition caused the secondary one

### Step 4: Attend C&P Exams and Emphasize Secondary Relationships

When you go to your C&P exam for a secondary condition, make sure the examiner understands the relationship to your primary condition. Don't assume they've read your file thoroughly.

Say things like: "My hip started hurting about two years after my service-connected knee injury. My orthopedist said it's because I've been walking with a limp to avoid putting weight on my bad knee."

## Real Example: Going from 70% to 100% with Secondary Conditions

Let's look at a real scenario (names changed):

**Veteran Status in 2020:**
- 70% PTSD
- 10% tinnitus
- **Combined rating: 73% → rounds to 70%**

**New Claims Filed in 2024:**
- Sleep apnea secondary to PTSD (50%)
- Depression secondary to PTSD (30%)
- Erectile dysfunction secondary to PTSD (0%, but helps with Total Disability Individual Unemployability)
- Migraine headaches secondary to PTSD (30%)

**New Combined Rating:**
Using VA's combined rating table:
- Start with highest: 70% (PTSD)
- Add 50% (sleep apnea): 85%
- Add 30% (depression): 90%
- Add 30% (migraines): 93%
- Add 10% (tinnitus): 94%
- Add 0% (ED): 94%

**94% rounds up to 100%.**

That veteran went from $1,716.28/month (70%) to $3,737.85/month (100%)—a $2,021.57/month increase ($24,258.84/year) just by filing for secondary conditions.

The back pay for the 8-month processing time? **$16,172.56** deposited in one lump sum.

Total cost to veteran: about $2,500 for nexus letters from a psychologist and sleep specialist.

Return on investment: over 6x in the first year alone, plus lifetime benefits.

## How to Request an Increase for Worsening Conditions

If your service-connected condition has gotten worse since your last rating, you can file for an increase. Here's how:

### 1. Gather Evidence of Worsening
- Recent medical records showing progression
- Increased frequency or severity of symptoms
- New limitations or functional impairments
- Treatment records (more medications, more appointments, surgeries)
- Statements from your doctor about worsening

### 2. Review the Rating Schedule
Look up your condition in the [VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/chapter-I/part-4). Each condition has specific criteria for different rating percentages. Identify which criteria you now meet for a higher rating.

For example, PTSD ratings:
- 30%: Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency
- 50%: Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity
- 70%: Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood)
- 100%: Total occupational and social impairment

If you were rated 50% three years ago but you've since lost a job due to PTSD symptoms, had relationship breakdowns, and struggle with daily activities, you likely meet the 70% criteria now.

### 3. File VA Form 21-526EZ for Increase
Check the box for "increase in compensation for a condition the VA has already determined to be service connected."

### 4. Be Prepared for a C&P Re-Exam
The VA will schedule a new exam to assess your current condition. This is critical: **document your worst days, not your best days.**

Many veterans make the mistake of downplaying symptoms during exams. Don't do this. The examiner needs to understand your limitations on bad days, not just how you're doing on the day of the exam.

Bring:
- A symptom journal showing frequency and severity
- Statements from family members about your limitations
- Employment records if you've lost jobs or had performance issues
- Documentation of medications and side effects

## Common Mistakes That Kill Increase Claims

### Mistake #1: Filing Too Soon
If you file for an increase and get denied, you generally can't file again unless your condition worsens further. Make sure you have solid evidence of worsening before filing.

### Mistake #2: Not Getting Current Medical Evidence
Medical records from 2 years ago won't cut it. You need recent documentation—ideally within 3-6 months of filing.

### Mistake #3: Filing for Increase But Ignoring Secondary Conditions
Don't just request an increase on your 70% PTSD—file for all the secondary conditions too. That's where the real rating gains are.

### Mistake #4: Underestimating Symptoms at C&P Exam
The examiner asks, "How often do you have panic attacks?" You say, "Oh, maybe once a month." But your actual frequency is 2-3 times per week. That underselling just cost you 20% on your rating.

**Be honest and thorough.** Describe your worst days, your limitations, how the condition affects your daily life, work, and relationships.

### Mistake #5: Not Tracking Your Symptoms
Keep a symptom journal. When did you have migraines this month? How many days were you unable to work due to back pain? How often did you have nightmares? The VA rates based on frequency and severity—give them data.

## The Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU) Path

Can't get to 100% scheduler (based on combined ratings) but your conditions prevent you from working? You might qualify for TDIU, which pays at the 100% rate.

**TDIU eligibility:**
- One service-connected condition rated at 60%+, OR
- Combined rating of 70%+ with one condition at 40%+, AND
- Unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected conditions

TDIU is huge for veterans with PTSD, TBI, or chronic pain conditions who can't hold down jobs but are rated at 70-80% combined.

File VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) along with:
- Employment history showing job instability or terminations
- Medical evidence linking your employment difficulties to your service-connected conditions
- Statements from former employers (if possible)
- Personal statement explaining why you can't work

## Timeline: How Long Does an Increase Take?

**Average processing time for increase claims: 6-8 months**

But you get retroactive back pay to the date you filed, so every month of waiting is another month of back pay when approved.

**Speed it up by:**
- Filing fully developed claims (all evidence upfront)
- Using a VSO to ensure your claim is complete
- Responding immediately to any VA requests for additional information
- Attending your C&P exam promptly (don't reschedule unless absolutely necessary)

## Success Rates: Your Odds of Getting an Increase

**National approval rates for increase claims: approximately 40-45%**

That might seem low, but most denials are due to insufficient evidence—not because the veteran doesn't deserve the increase.

**Increase your success rate by:**
- Filing only when you have strong evidence of worsening or new secondary conditions
- Getting nexus letters from qualified specialists
- Being thorough and honest at C&P exams
- Using a VSO or accredited claims agent to review your claim before submitting

**Claims with private medical opinions (nexus letters) have success rates of 60-70%+**—it's worth the investment.

## Real Talk: Is It Worth the Hassle?

Let's be honest—filing for increases is time-consuming, requires paperwork and medical appointments, costs money for nexus letters, and takes months to process.

So is it worth it?

**Quick math:**
- Cost: $1,500-$3,000 in nexus letters and medical appointments
- Time: 20-30 hours of your time gathering evidence, attending exams, tracking the claim
- Success rate: 60% with good evidence

**Potential payoff (70% → 100%):**
- Monthly increase: $2,021.57
- Annual increase: $24,258.84
- 30-year lifetime value: $727,764

Even with just a 60% success rate, the expected value is $436,659 over 30 years. That's a pretty solid return on 30 hours and $3,000.

But even smaller increases matter:
- 50% → 60%: $286.72/month ($3,440.64/year)
- 60% → 70%: $354.40/month ($4,252.80/year)
- 80% → 90%: $246.90/month ($2,962.80/year)

For most veterans, filing for secondary conditions and increases is absolutely worth it.

## Your Action Plan

Here's your step-by-step roadmap:

### Week 1: Assessment
- Pull your VA rating decision letters and review your current ratings
- List all your service-connected conditions
- Identify potential secondary conditions for each
- Use our [VA Disability Calculator](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com/calculator/va-disability) to model how new ratings would affect your combined rating

### Week 2-3: Medical Evidence
- Schedule appointments with specialists for each potential secondary condition
- Request copies of all your medical records from the past 2 years
- Get current diagnoses documented
- Start a symptom journal tracking frequency and severity

### Week 4-5: Nexus Letters
- Decide which conditions need nexus letters
- Research qualified providers (your own doctors vs. IMO services)
- Submit records for nexus letter reviews
- Budget $400-$800 per nexus letter

### Week 6: File the Claim
- Complete VA Form 21-526EZ
- Upload all medical records
- Upload all nexus letters
- Submit a detailed personal statement for each condition
- File through VA.gov or with a VSO

### Months 2-8: Follow-Up
- Check your claim status weekly on VA.gov
- Respond immediately to any VA requests
- Attend all scheduled C&P exams
- Track all correspondence

### Month 8+: Decision and Back Pay
- Review your rating decision letter
- If approved: expect back pay within 2 weeks
- If denied: request a Higher-Level Review or Supplemental Claim with additional evidence

## Don't Leave Money on the Table

Thousands of veterans are rated at 70%, 80%, or 90% when they actually qualify for 100%. They're leaving six figures in lifetime benefits on the table because they don't understand secondary conditions or haven't updated their ratings as conditions worsen.

You earned these benefits through your service and sacrifice. The VA's job is to accurately rate your disabilities—but it's YOUR job to provide the evidence.

If you're sitting at 50-90%, there's a very good chance you qualify for a higher rating right now. Don't wait another year while your conditions worsen without compensation.
