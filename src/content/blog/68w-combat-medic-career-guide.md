# 68W Combat Medic to Civilian: EMT, RN, or PA? Your Complete Career Roadmap

You spent your military career as a 68W Combat Medic—trauma care under fire, field surgeries, combat casualty care that would make civilian paramedics' eyes water. You've done more real medicine in one deployment than most EMTs see in five years.

So why is the civilian transition so complicated?

Here's the frustrating truth: your military medical training is absolutely valuable, but civilian healthcare has a certification maze that doesn't give a damn about your combat experience. You need the right credentials, and there are three main tracks to choose from.

Let's break down exactly which path fits your goals, timeline, and budget—and show you how to go from $40K to $120K+ in the healthcare field.

## The Three Tracks: Quick Overview

| Track | Timeline | Total Cost | Starting Salary | Peak Salary | Best For |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **EMT/Paramedic** | 6-24 months | $1,000-$8,000 | $35K-$45K | $60K-$75K | Fast entry, immediate work, stepping stone |
| **Registered Nurse (RN)** | 2-4 years | $10K-$40K | $60K-$75K | $90K-$120K | Best balance of pay and education time |
| **Physician Assistant (PA)** | 6-7 years | $80K-$120K | $100K-$115K | $130K-$150K+ | Highest ceiling, most autonomy, longest path |

Let's dive deep into each track.

## Track 1: EMT/Paramedic — The Fast Entry Path

### The Good News
Your 68W training transfers most directly to EMT/Paramedic work. You already know trauma care, triage, patient assessment, and medication administration—skills that take civilians months to learn.

### The Bad News
Despite your experience, you still need civilian certifications, and most states won't just hand you a paramedic license based on military experience alone.

### How to Get There

**Step 1: Get Your EMT-Basic (3-6 months, $1,000-$2,000)**

Even though you've done advanced procedures in combat, you need to start with EMT-Basic certification. The course covers:
- Patient assessment and vitals
- Basic airway management
- CPR and AED
- Trauma and medical emergencies
- Legal and ethical issues

**Good news:** As a 68W, this will feel like a refresher course. You'll breeze through it.

**Course options:**
- Community college programs: $1,000-$1,500, nights/weekends, 3-6 months
- Private training centers: $1,500-$2,000, accelerated 4-6 weeks
- Online hybrid programs: $800-$1,200 (with in-person skills lab)

**Use your GI Bill?** Probably not worth it here—save it for RN or PA school. Pay out of pocket or use Vocational Rehabilitation (VR&E).

**After completion:**
- Pass NREMT (National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians) exam
- Apply for state EMT license
- **Starting pay: $35,000-$45,000/year**

**Step 2: Get Your Paramedic Certification (12-24 months, $5,000-$10,000)**

This is where your 68W training really shines. Paramedic school covers advanced skills:
- Advanced airway management (intubation)
- IV therapy and medication administration
- Cardiac monitoring and 12-lead EKGs
- Pharmacology
- Advanced trauma life support

**You've done most of this in combat**, so you'll have an edge over civilian students. But you still need the classroom time and clinical rotations.

**Program options:**
- Community college Associate's in Paramedicine: $5,000-$8,000, 18-24 months
- Private paramedic programs: $8,000-$12,000, 12-18 months
- Hybrid programs for military medics: Some states offer expedited programs recognizing your 68W experience

**After completion:**
- Pass NREMT Paramedic exam
- Get state paramedic license
- **Starting pay: $45,000-$55,000/year**
- **Experienced pay: $55,000-$75,000/year**

### Where 68Ws Work as Paramedics

**Fire departments:** Many fire departments run EMS services. Salary ranges $50K-$75K, excellent benefits, pension. Competitive hiring.

**Private ambulance companies:** AMR, Acadian, Falck. Salary $40K-$60K. High call volume, good experience, less competitive hiring.

**Hospital EMS:** Some hospitals run their own ambulance services or critical care transport teams. Pay $50K-$70K.

**Flight medic:** The holy grail for former 68Ws. Helicopter and fixed-wing medical transport. Requires 3-5 years of paramedic experience, critical care certification. Pay $60K-$85K.

**Tactical paramedic:** Work with SWAT teams, federal agencies, private security. Pay $55K-$80K. Often requires additional tactical training.

**Offshore/industrial medic:** Oil rigs, remote construction sites, events. Pay $60K-$90K+ (per diem). Excellent money, but isolated work.

### Pros and Cons of the EMT/Paramedic Track

**Pros:**
- Fastest entry into civilian healthcare (6 months to 2 years)
- Lowest cost ($1K-$10K total)
- Direct transfer of your 68W skills
- Can work while pursuing further education (RN/PA)
- Adrenaline and variety—closest to combat medicine

**Cons:**
- Lower pay ceiling ($60K-$75K for most)
- Physically demanding (lifting patients, long shifts)
- High burnout rate
- Irregular hours (nights, weekends, holidays)
- Limited career advancement without more education

**Best for:** 68Ws who want to start working immediately, need income now, or plan to use paramedic work as a stepping stone to RN or PA school.

## Track 2: Registered Nurse (RN) — The Best Balance

### Why RN Is the Sweet Spot

For most 68Ws, becoming an RN offers the best combination of:
- Reasonable education timeline (2-4 years)
- Strong starting salary ($60K-$75K)
- Excellent benefits and job security
- Advancement opportunities (BSN → MSN → NP)
- Diverse specializations (ER, ICU, flight nurse, OR)

You can make $90K-$120K as an experienced RN, and if you continue to Nurse Practitioner (NP), you're looking at $110K-$140K+ with prescriptive authority.

### The Challenge: Your 68W Training Doesn't Transfer Credits

Here's the frustrating part: even though you have extensive medical training, nursing schools rarely accept military medical training for credit toward an RN degree. You're starting mostly from scratch.

Why? Nursing education focuses on nursing theory, holistic patient care, care plans, and legal/ethical frameworks—not just clinical skills. It's a different philosophy than the medical model you learned as a 68W.

**Exception:** Some schools offer "military-friendly" RN programs with accelerated tracks or challenge exams for certain courses. The University of Texas at Arlington, Chamberlain University, and Excelsior College have programs specifically for military medics.

### How to Get There

**Option 1: Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) — 2 years, $10,000-$20,000**

**Timeline:** 2 years (including prerequisites)

**Process:**
1. Complete prerequisites: Anatomy & Physiology I & II, Microbiology, Chemistry, Psychology, English (6-12 months if part-time, $2K-$4K)
2. Apply to ADN program (competitive—GPA matters)
3. Complete 2-year ADN program (nursing courses + clinical rotations)
4. Pass NCLEX-RN exam

**Where:** Community colleges, some technical schools

**Cost:** $8,000-$15,000 for ADN program (tuition only)

**GI Bill strategy:** Use GI Bill for the ADN program, pay out-of-pocket for prerequisites (cheaper that way, saves GI Bill months)

**After graduation:**
- Pass NCLEX-RN (the nursing licensing exam)
- Apply for RN jobs
- **Starting pay: $58,000-$72,000** (varies by location)

**Option 2: Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) — 4 years, $40,000-$80,000**

**Timeline:** 4 years (traditional BSN) OR 16-24 months (accelerated BSN for those with a prior bachelor's degree)

**Process:**
1. If you already have a bachelor's degree in anything, look for **Accelerated BSN (ABSN)** programs—12-18 months, intense, but fast-tracks you to RN
2. If no degree, complete traditional 4-year BSN program

**Where:** Universities, some online programs (like WGU, Chamberlain, Aspen)

**Cost:** $40,000-$80,000 (private schools higher, public schools lower)

**GI Bill strategy:** Absolutely use your full GI Bill for BSN—it's expensive and worth the benefit coverage.

**After graduation:**
- Pass NCLEX-RN
- Apply for RN jobs
- **Starting pay: $60,000-$75,000** (BSN grads often start $2K-$5K higher than ADN grads)

**Important:** Many hospitals now prefer or require BSN for hiring, especially for specialty units (ICU, ER, OR). If you go the ADN route, plan to do an RN-to-BSN bridge program within 2-3 years.

### Where 68Ws Work as RNs

**Emergency Department (ED):** Fast-paced, trauma, critical thinking. This is where most former 68Ws thrive. Pay $65K-$95K.

**Intensive Care Unit (ICU):** Critical care, ventilators, advanced monitoring. High acuity. Pay $70K-$100K.

**Operating Room (OR):** Surgical nursing. Technical, fast-paced. Pay $68K-$95K.

**Flight Nurse:** Air medical transport. Requires 3-5 years critical care experience, CCRN certification, often CFRN. Pay $75K-$110K+.

**Correctional Nursing:** VA hospitals, federal prisons, military treatment facilities. Pay $65K-$90K. Many former 68Ws like this because it feels familiar.

**Travel Nursing:** Work 13-week contracts across the country. Pay $80K-$140K+ (including stipends). Great way to see the country and make excellent money.

**Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Civilian RN:** Work on military bases as a civilian nurse. Pay $65K-$85K, federal benefits, familiar environment.

### Career Advancement: RN → Nurse Practitioner (NP)

Once you're an RN with a BSN, you can pursue a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) to become a Nurse Practitioner. This is huge.

**Nurse Practitioner (NP) roles:**
- Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP): Primary care, diagnose and prescribe
- Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (ACNP): Hospital-based, critical care
- Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP): Mental health, prescribe psych meds
- Emergency Nurse Practitioner (ENP): ER-focused

**Timeline from RN to NP:** 2-3 years (part-time MSN programs while working)

**Cost:** $30K-$60K

**Salary:** $100K-$140K+

**This is the path many former 68Ws take:** ADN/BSN → RN (2-4 years) → Work 2-3 years → MSN/NP (2-3 years part-time) → NP making $110K+.

Total timeline: 6-10 years from separation to NP, but you're earning good money as an RN the whole time.

### Pros and Cons of the RN Track

**Pros:**
- Strong starting salary ($60K-$75K)
- High job security (nursing shortage)
- Diverse specializations and settings
- Clear advancement path (BSN → MSN → NP)
- Excellent benefits (most hospital jobs)
- Can work anywhere in the country

**Cons:**
- 2-4 years of school (longer than EMT/Paramedic)
- Nursing school is competitive and intense
- Your 68W training doesn't transfer for credit (frustrating)
- 12-hour shifts, nights/weekends common
- High-stress environment (depending on specialty)

**Best for:** 68Ws willing to invest 2-4 years in education for a solid, long-term healthcare career with advancement potential.

## Track 3: Physician Assistant (PA) — The Highest Ceiling

### Why PA Is the Ultimate Goal for Many 68Ws

Physician Assistants diagnose conditions, prescribe medications, perform procedures, and work with a high degree of autonomy. It's the closest you'll get to being a doctor without going to medical school.

**PA salary range: $100,000-$150,000+**

**Job satisfaction:** PAs consistently rank among the highest job satisfaction ratings in healthcare. You get to practice medicine, make real decisions, and don't deal with the brutal residency and debt of medical school.

**For 68Ws:** Your combat medical experience is incredibly valuable in PA school admissions. Admissions committees LOVE military medics because you have real-world patient care experience.

### The Challenge: It's a Long, Expensive Path

PA school requires:
- A bachelor's degree (any major, but science-heavy)
- Prerequisite courses (Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Microbiology, etc.)
- **2,000+ hours of direct patient care experience** (this is where your 68W experience shines)
- Competitive GPA (3.5+ preferred)

Then, PA school itself is:
- 2-3 years, full-time (no working during PA school—it's intense)
- $80,000-$120,000 in tuition (private schools often $100K+)

**Total timeline from separation to practicing PA: 6-7 years**

That's a long time and a huge financial investment. But the payoff is $100K-$150K+ salary with great job security and fulfillment.

### How to Get There

**Step 1: Get a Bachelor's Degree (if you don't have one)**

**Timeline:** 4 years (or 2-3 years if you have credits from military)

**Major:** Doesn't matter, but Biology, Exercise Science, or Health Sciences are common and help with prerequisites.

**Cost:** $20K-$60K (use your GI Bill here)

**Many 68Ws already have some college credits.** Check with your school—JST (Joint Services Transcript) may transfer some credits.

**Step 2: Complete PA School Prerequisites**

Even if you have a bachelor's, you need specific courses:
- Anatomy & Physiology I & II
- Microbiology
- General Chemistry I & II
- Organic Chemistry
- Biochemistry
- Statistics
- Psychology

**Timeline:** 1-2 years (if not included in your bachelor's)
**Cost:** $3K-$8K

**Many schools accept online prerequisites** from providers like UC Berkeley Extension, Doane University, Portage Learning, or BYU Independent Study.

**Step 3: Document Your Patient Care Hours**

PA schools require **1,000-4,000 hours of direct patient care experience** (varies by program). The average accepted applicant has around 3,000 hours.

**Good news:** Your time as a 68W counts! Document:
- Combat deployments with medical care
- Sick call hours
- Field training exercises
- TMC (troop medical clinic) rotations

**Even better:** Work as an EMT, paramedic, ER tech, or medical assistant while completing prerequisites. This adds more hours and civilian experience.

**Step 4: Apply to PA School**

**When:** Start applying about 1 year before you want to start (PA programs use rolling admissions)

**Applications:** Use CASPA (Central Application Service for Physician Assistants)—one application for multiple schools

**Cost:** $179 for first program, $60 for each additional

**Acceptance rate:** About 30% nationally—competitive, but your 68W experience is a huge advantage

**Write a compelling personal statement** about your military medical experience. Admissions committees want to hear about your trauma care, your leadership, your ability to handle stress. This is where you shine.

**Step 5: Complete PA School**

**Timeline:** 24-36 months (full-time, no breaks)

**Curriculum:**
- Didactic year: Classroom (Anatomy, Pharmacology, Pathophysiology, Physical Diagnosis, etc.)
- Clinical year: Rotations (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, Psychiatry, Pediatrics, OB/GYN)

**Cost:** $80,000-$120,000 (tuition + fees)

**Can you use GI Bill?** YES—and you should. But PA school is expensive and may exceed your GI Bill benefits. You'll likely need loans for part of it.

**After graduation:**
- Pass PANCE (Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam)
- Get state licensure
- Start earning $100K-$115K right out of school

### Where 68Ws Work as PAs

**Emergency Medicine:** Fast-paced, trauma, variety. Pay $110K-$130K. Very popular with former 68Ws.

**Urgent Care:** Less acute than ER, regular hours. Pay $100K-$120K.

**Surgery (Surgical PA):** First assist in surgeries, pre/post-op care. Pay $105K-$125K.

**Orthopedics:** Sports medicine, joint replacements, fractures. Pay $110K-$135K.

**Military/VA:** Work as a civilian PA for DoD or VA. Pay $100K-$120K, federal benefits, loan repayment programs.

**Federal Agencies:** FBI, Secret Service, Diplomatic Security. Pay $115K-$140K+.

**Remote/Telemedicine PA:** Growing field. Work from home doing virtual visits. Pay $95K-$115K.

### Pros and Cons of the PA Track

**Pros:**
- Highest earning potential ($100K-$150K+)
- Practice medicine with autonomy
- High job satisfaction
- No residency required (unlike MDs)
- Your 68W experience gives you a competitive edge for admissions
- Loan repayment programs available (VA, NHSC, military)

**Cons:**
- Longest timeline (6-7 years from separation)
- Most expensive ($80K-$120K for PA school alone)
- Can't work during PA school (2-3 years with no income)
- Requires bachelor's degree first
- Competitive admissions (30% acceptance rate)

**Best for:** 68Ws committed to a long-term investment in the highest level of medical practice short of becoming a physician.

## The Hybrid Strategy: Work While You Climb

Here's what many smart 68Ws do:

**Years 1-2:** Get EMT/Paramedic certification, start working ($45K-$55K)

**Years 3-4:** Work as paramedic while completing RN prerequisites or bachelor's degree part-time (keep earning)

**Years 5-6:** Complete RN program (ADN or ABSN), pass NCLEX, start working as RN ($60K-$75K)

**Years 7-10:** Work as RN while considering NP or PA school, save money

**Years 11-13:** Complete NP or PA program ($100K-$140K)

This path lets you:
- Start earning quickly
- Gain diverse medical experience
- Fund your education as you go
- Make informed decisions about your ultimate career goal

You don't have to commit to one path immediately. Start with EMT, see how you like civilian healthcare, then decide whether to pursue RN or PA.

## Using Your GI Bill Strategically

Your Post-9/11 GI Bill is 36 months of benefits. Here's how to maximize it:

### Strategy 1: Save It for PA School
- Pay out of pocket for EMT/Paramedic (~$10K)
- Use GI Bill for bachelor's degree (if needed) + PA school
- This covers the most expensive parts of your education

### Strategy 2: Use It for BSN
- Pay out of pocket for prerequisites
- Use GI Bill for 4-year BSN program
- Work as RN, then pay for NP school out-of-pocket or with employer tuition assistance

### Strategy 3: Use VR&E Instead
- If you have a service-connected disability rating, you may qualify for Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E, also called Chapter 31)
- VR&E covers up to 48 months of education/training, books, supplies, even a monthly stipend
- This lets you save your GI Bill for a family member via transfer

**Talk to a VR&E counselor** at your VA facility—many 68Ws qualify and don't realize it.

## Salary Progression: $40K → $120K+

Here's a realistic 10-year salary progression for a 68W following the hybrid path:

| Year | Role | Salary |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | EMT | $38,000 |
| 2 | Paramedic | $48,000 |
| 3 | Paramedic | $52,000 |
| 4 | Paramedic (in RN school) | $55,000 |
| 5 | New RN | $65,000 |
| 6 | RN (2 years exp) | $72,000 |
| 7 | RN (ICU) | $78,000 |
| 8 | RN (travel nursing) | $95,000 |
| 9 | Nurse Practitioner (new) | $105,000 |
| 10 | NP (2 years exp) | $118,000 |

**Lifetime earnings (30-year career):** $3,000,000+

Not bad for a combat medic from wherever you're from.
