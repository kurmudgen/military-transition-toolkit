# Tendonitis Secondary to Joint Condition: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Common progression of joint conditions
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-20% (depends on location and severity)
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected joint condition, tendonitis diagnosis, documentation of progression, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate to High (60-75%) with clear documentation

Tendonitis commonly develops secondary to joint conditions due to compensatory movements, altered mechanics, and overuse. If you have a service-connected joint condition that has led to tendonitis, you may have grounds for a secondary claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For tendonitis secondary to joint conditions:
- Your original joint condition must be service-connected
- Tendonitis must be diagnosed
- The joint condition must have caused or worsened the tendonitis

## How Joint Conditions Cause Tendonitis

### Compensatory Overuse

**Mechanism:**
- Injured joint limits function
- Adjacent structures compensate
- Increased stress on tendons
- Inflammation and damage develop

**Common Patterns:**
- Knee injury → Hip tendonitis (IT band, hip flexors)
- Shoulder injury → Elbow tendonitis (lateral epicondylitis)
- Ankle injury → Achilles tendonitis
- Back condition → Hip flexor tendonitis

### Altered Biomechanics

**Changes That Cause Tendonitis:**
- Limping changes load distribution
- Muscle imbalances stress tendons
- Joint instability increases tendon strain
- Favoring one side overloads the other

### Direct Extension

**From Adjacent Joint:**
- Inflammation spreads to nearby tendons
- Arthritis affecting tendon attachments
- Joint deformity stressing tendons

## Common Tendonitis Conditions

### Upper Extremity

**Rotator Cuff Tendonitis:**
- Common secondary to neck conditions
- From compensatory shoulder use
- Rated under DC 5024

**Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow):**
- Extensor tendon inflammation
- From compensatory gripping
- Rated under DC 5024

**Medial Epicondylitis (Golfer's Elbow):**
- Flexor tendon inflammation
- Similar mechanisms

**Biceps Tendonitis:**
- From shoulder or elbow conditions
- Compensatory lifting patterns

### Lower Extremity

**Achilles Tendonitis:**
- Very common with ankle/knee conditions
- From altered gait
- Can lead to rupture if severe

**Patellar Tendonitis:**
- From knee conditions
- "Jumper's knee" pattern

**IT Band Syndrome:**
- From hip or knee conditions
- Lateral knee/thigh pain

**Hip Flexor Tendonitis:**
- From back or hip conditions
- From altered gait patterns

**Plantar Fasciitis:**
- From ankle/knee/hip conditions
- Often considered tendonitis of plantar fascia

## VA Rating Criteria

Tendonitis is typically rated under:

### Tenosynovitis (DC 5024)

**Rated Based on:**
- Limitation of motion of affected part
- Pain and functional loss
- Or as degenerative arthritis

**Under Arthritis Rules:**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | X-ray evidence with painful motion |
| 20% | With incapacitating exacerbations |

### By Limitation of Motion

If tendonitis causes ROM limitation:
- Rated under the specific joint's ROM codes
- DeLuca factors (pain, weakness) considered
- Functional loss documented

### Examples by Location

**Shoulder (DC 5201):**
- 20%: Arm limited at shoulder level
- Higher with more limitation

**Elbow (DC 5206/5207):**
- 10%: Flexion limited to 100°
- Higher with more limitation

**Ankle (DC 5271):**
- 10%: Moderate limitation
- 20%: Marked limitation

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Primary Joint Condition:**
- Service connection documentation
- Treatment history
- Current symptoms and limitations

**For Tendonitis:**
- Formal diagnosis with specific tendon
- Physical examination findings
- Imaging if available (MRI, ultrasound)
- Treatment records

### Diagnostic Testing

**MRI:**
- Shows tendon inflammation/tears
- Identifies specific tendon involved
- Demonstrates severity

**Ultrasound:**
- Can visualize tendon changes
- Dynamic assessment possible
- Less expensive than MRI

**Physical Examination:**
- Point tenderness over tendon
- Pain with resisted movements
- Possible crepitus

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Orthopedist or physiatrist
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Tendonitis diagnosis with specific location**
4. **Connection to service-connected condition**
5. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records. [Veteran] is service-connected for right knee degenerative joint disease at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Left Achilles tendonitis*

*Physical Examination:*
*- Tenderness over left Achilles tendon*
*- Pain with resisted plantarflexion*
*- Mild thickening palpated*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] left Achilles tendonitis is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected right knee condition.*

*Medical Rationale: [Veteran's] right knee arthritis has resulted in antalgic gait with weight-shifting to the left lower extremity. This compensatory pattern places increased load on the left Achilles tendon. The mechanism of overuse tendonitis from gait compensation is well-established in orthopedic literature. Physical examination findings confirm Achilles tendonitis on the contralateral (compensating) side, supporting this etiology."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Tendonitis Location

Determine which tendon is affected:
- Is it related to compensating for service-connected condition?
- Document the connection

### Step 2: Get Tendonitis Diagnosed

See appropriate specialist:
- Orthopedist
- Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation
- Sports medicine

### Step 3: Document the Mechanism

Explain how joint condition led to tendonitis:
- Compensatory overuse?
- Altered biomechanics?
- Direct spread?

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get physician opinion:
- Must explain causal chain
- Cost: $500-$1,000

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Specific tendon location
- Link to joint condition
- Upload evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Joint and tendon examination expected
- ROM testing
- Pain assessment
- Be thorough describing symptoms

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague diagnosis** - Specify WHICH tendon

2. **Missing biomechanical explanation** - Must explain HOW joint caused tendonitis

3. **Not documenting gait changes** - Key evidence for lower extremity

4. **Forgetting contralateral side** - Compensating side often affected

5. **No imaging** - MRI/ultrasound strengthens claim

6. **Waiting until chronic** - Claim when diagnosed

7. **Confusing with joint condition** - Tendonitis is distinct from arthritis

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Achilles Tendonitis from Knee

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, 30% right knee DJD
- Left Achilles pain developing over 2 years
- PT documented compensatory gait
- MRI confirms Achilles tendinopathy

**Evidence:**
- Gait analysis showing compensation
- MRI of Achilles
- Orthopedic nexus

**Outcome:** 10% for left Achilles tendonitis
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 40%

### Case Study 2: Rotator Cuff from Cervical Spine

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, 20% cervical strain
- Right shoulder pain developing
- Uses shoulder differently due to neck
- MRI shows supraspinatus tendinopathy

**Evidence:**
- Shoulder MRI
- Documented neck-related movement changes
- Nexus from orthopedist

**Outcome:** 20% for right shoulder condition
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 36% (rounds to 40%)

### Case Study 3: IT Band Syndrome from Hip

**Background:** 45-year-old veteran, 40% bilateral hip arthritis
- Lateral knee pain both sides
- IT band syndrome diagnosed
- PT notes compensatory patterns

**Evidence:**
- Bilateral IT band syndrome diagnosis
- Hip condition documentation
- Nexus explaining mechanism

**Outcome:** 10% each side with bilateral factor
**Combined Rating:** Increased significantly

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Tendonitis at 10%:**
- Before: 30% = $508.05
- Add 10% tendonitis = 37% → rounds to 40%
- After: $673.28
- Increase: $165.23/month

**Tendonitis at 20%:**
- Before: 40% = $673.28
- Add 20% tendonitis = 52% → rounds to 50%
- After: $1,041.82
- Increase: $368.54/month

## Multiple Tendonitis Claims

### Can You Claim Multiple Tendons?

**Yes.** Each can be rated separately if:
- Different tendons affected
- Each documented and diagnosed
- Connection established for each

### Bilateral Considerations

If both sides affected (e.g., bilateral Achilles):
- Each side rated
- Bilateral factor applies
- Combined then added to total

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Tendonitis common condition"** - Need individualized causation
2. **"No nexus to service-connected condition"** - Need clearer connection
3. **"Not separate from joint condition"** - Must show distinct diagnosis

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add imaging (MRI/ultrasound)
- Stronger biomechanical nexus
- Physical therapy documentation of compensation
- Medical literature support

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is tendonitis different from arthritis?**
A: Tendonitis affects tendons (connecting muscle to bone), arthritis affects joints. They're different conditions.

**Q: Can tendonitis become chronic?**
A: Yes, untreated tendonitis can become tendinosis (chronic degeneration).

**Q: Does imaging help?**
A: MRI or ultrasound showing tendon changes significantly strengthens your claim.

**Q: What if tendonitis heals?**
A: Claim based on when it was symptomatic. If it recurs, document recurrence.

**Q: Can I get PT through VA for tendonitis?**
A: If service-connected, VA covers treatment including physical therapy.

**Q: Is rotator cuff tear the same as tendonitis?**
A: Tendonitis is inflammation; tear is structural damage. Tears often follow chronic tendonitis.

**Q: Can tendonitis lead to other claims?**
A: Yes. Tendonitis can cause weakness, which may lead to other compensatory injuries.
