# New York Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

New York's best veteran tax benefit is the complete exemption of military retirement pay from state income tax—saving retirees $2,500-$6,000+ annually. However, property tax benefits are limited compared to other states. The Alternative Veterans' Exemption provides only 15-25% reduction in assessed value (with local caps), not the full exemption offered by neighboring states.

For a 100% disabled veteran, New York's property tax benefit maxes out at 50% of assessed value (half of disability rating), capped by local municipalities—typically saving $3,000-$8,000 annually depending on county. In contrast, states like New Hampshire and Florida offer full 100% property tax exemptions for disabled veterans.

The Alternative Veterans' Exemption structure works as follows: 15% reduction for wartime service, additional 10% for combat zone service, and additional reduction equal to one-half your disability rating. A 100% disabled combat veteran gets maximum 25% base exemption plus 50% disability exemption—but municipalities cap the dollar amount. In Nassau County (expensive properties), caps are around $75,000-$100,000 of assessed value; in upstate counties, caps run $12,000-$30,000.

New York also offers the Cold War Veterans Exemption (10-15% reduction for service between 1945-1991) and pending legislation for full exemption for 100% disabled veterans—though this has been proposed annually without passage.

Downsides? New York has the highest property taxes nationally (averaging $5,500-$10,000+ depending on county), so even with exemptions, veterans pay significant property tax. Cost of living in NYC is extremely high. State income tax rates reach 10.9% for high earners, though military retirement is exempt.

Overall verdict: **6.5/10** for tax benefits. Excellent military retirement exemption, but property tax relief is moderate compared to top veteran states. Best for military retirees without disability; less competitive for 100% disabled veterans compared to states with full property tax exemptions.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Base exemption: 15% (wartime) + 10% (combat) + 50% (half of 100% disability rating) = **up to 75% of assessed value**
- However: Most municipalities cap this at dollar amounts, not percentages
- Typical savings: $3,000-$10,000 annually depending on county and caps
- Requirements: Service-connected disability from VA; primary residence only

New York does NOT offer full 100% property tax exemption for disabled veterans (unlike Texas, Florida, or New Hampshire). Pending legislation (Senate Bill S1183) would create a full exemption, but it's been proposed repeatedly without passage and requires local municipalities to opt in.

**Alternative Veterans' Exemption (Most Common):**

New York's Alternative Veterans' Exemption is available in over 95% of counties, cities, towns, and villages. Here's how it works:

- **15% reduction** in assessed value for veterans who served during wartime
- **Additional 10% reduction** for veterans who served in combat zones or received expeditionary medals
- **Additional reduction** for service-connected disabilities equal to **one-half of the disability rating**

**Examples by Disability Rating:**

*100% Disabled Veteran (Combat, Wartime):*
- Base exemption: 15% + 10% = 25%
- Disability exemption: 50% (half of 100%)
- **Total: 75% reduction in assessed value** (subject to local caps)
- Nassau County home ($600,000 assessed, $100,000 cap): Saves approximately $8,750/year
- Upstate county home ($300,000 assessed, $30,000 cap): Saves approximately $6,600/year

*70% Disabled Veteran (Combat, Wartime):*
- Base: 25%
- Disability: 35% (half of 70%)
- **Total: 60% reduction** (subject to caps)
- Typical savings: $4,000-$7,000 depending on location

*50% Disabled Veteran (Combat, Wartime):*
- Base: 25%
- Disability: 25% (half of 50%)
- **Total: 50% reduction** (subject to caps)
- Typical savings: $3,000-$5,000

*Wartime Veteran (No Disability):*
- **15% reduction only**
- Typical savings: $1,500-$3,000 depending on property value and location

**Cold War Veterans' Exemption:**

For veterans who served between September 2, 1945, and December 26, 1991:

- **10% or 15% reduction** in assessed value (as adopted by municipality)
- **Additional reduction** for service-connected disabilities equal to one-half of disability rating
- **Limited to 10 years duration** unless municipality makes it indefinite
- Disability portion has no time limit

This applies to veterans who may not qualify for the Alternative Veterans' Exemption but served during the Cold War period.

**Eligible Funds Exemption:**

This exemption reduces the property's assessed value for funds used to purchase the home, up to a maximum of **$5,000** in most municipalities. It's limited but available to eligible veterans.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local tax assessor** (county, town, or city assessor's office)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4) showing discharge type and dates of service
   - VA award letter showing disability rating (if claiming disability exemption)
   - Proof of New York residency
   - Property deed showing ownership

3. **File application by March 15**
   - Deadline: **March 15** to receive benefit in the following tax year (beginning July 1)
   - If March 15 falls on weekend/holiday, deadline is next business day
   - Applications: Form RP-458-a (Alternative Veterans' Exemption) or Form RP-458-b (Cold War Exemption)
   - Available at: tax.ny.gov or your local assessor's office

4. **Processing and renewal:**
   - Processing time: 30-60 days
   - Most exemptions renew automatically once approved
   - Notify assessor if you move or circumstances change

**Important:** Exemption caps and amounts vary by municipality. Contact your local assessor to confirm the specific caps in your county, city, town, or village.

### Property Tax by County

New York has the highest property taxes in America. Average effective rates and annual taxes vary dramatically:

| County/Area | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Savings (50% Exempt) | Savings (75% Exempt) |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Nassau (Long Island) | $600,000 | 2.10% | $12,600 | $6,300 | $9,450 |
| Suffolk (Long Island) | $500,000 | 2.42% | $12,100 | $6,050 | $9,075 |
| Westchester | $650,000 | 2.29% | $14,885 | $7,443 | $11,164 |
| Manhattan (NYC) | $1,200,000 | 0.88% | $10,560 | $5,280 | $7,920 |
| Brooklyn (NYC) | $909,000 | 0.60% | $5,454 | $2,727 | $4,091 |
| Queens (NYC) | $700,000 | 0.85% | $5,950 | $2,975 | $4,463 |
| Erie (Buffalo) | $200,000 | 2.50% | $5,000 | $2,500 | $3,750 |
| Monroe (Rochester) | $175,000 | 2.80% | $4,900 | $2,450 | $3,675 |
| Onondaga (Syracuse) | $196,000 | 2.60% | $5,096 | $2,548 | $3,822 |
| Albany | $296,000 | 2.20% | $6,512 | $3,256 | $4,884 |

**Key Points:**

- Long Island (Nassau/Suffolk) and Westchester have the highest absolute property tax bills in America
- NYC has lower effective rates but extremely high home values
- Upstate New York (Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany) offers more affordable housing but still high tax rates
- Property tax bills exceeding $10,000 are common in downstate counties

**Example:** A 100% disabled veteran in Nassau County with a $600,000 home:
- Without exemption: $12,600 annually
- With Alternative Veterans' Exemption (75% reduction, capped at $100,000 assessed): Saves approximately $8,750 annually
- **Remaining tax: $3,850/year** (still substantial)

Over 20 years, that's $175,000 in savings—but you still pay $77,000 in property taxes.

### Municipal Caps and Variations

The biggest limitation of New York's property tax exemptions is that municipalities set dollar caps on exemption amounts. These caps vary widely:

**High-Cap Counties (Downstate):**
- Nassau County: Increased caps to $75,000-$100,000 (2024)
- Suffolk County: Similar caps around $75,000-$100,000
- Westchester County: Varies by municipality, typically $50,000-$80,000

**Lower-Cap Counties (Upstate):**
- Erie County (Buffalo): Increased caps to $30,000 base / $20,000 combat / $100,000 disability (2024)
- Monroe County (Rochester): Approximately $20,000-$40,000
- Albany County: Approximately $15,000-$30,000
- Rural counties: Often $12,000-$20,000

**Impact of Caps:**

Even if you qualify for a 75% reduction in assessed value, the dollar cap limits your actual savings. For expensive homes (especially downstate), you'll hit the cap and still pay significant property taxes.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—Military retirement pay is 100% exempt**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $2,500-$6,000+ compared to taxing states

New York completely exempts federal and state government pensions and military retirement pay from state income tax. This applies to:
- Active duty military retirement
- Reserve and National Guard retirement after 20+ years
- Military disability retirement pay
- Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments

**No income cap, no age requirement, no limit**—all military retirement pay is tax-free in New York.

**Example savings:**

*O-5 retiree with $70,000 military pension:*
- In Pennsylvania (3.07% flat rate): $2,149 state tax
- In New York: **$0**
- **Annual savings: $2,149**

*E-8 retiree with $45,000 military pension:*
- In Connecticut (4.5-6.99% brackets): $2,250 state tax
- In New York: **$0**
- **Annual savings: $2,250**

*O-6 retiree with $100,000 military pension:*
- In California (9.3% bracket): $9,300 state tax
- In New York: **$0**
- **Annual savings: $9,300**

However, if you work after retirement and earn civilian income, New York's income tax rates apply to that income:

**New York State Income Tax Rates (2025):**
- 4% on income up to $8,500 (single) / $17,150 (married)
- 4.5% on income up to $11,700 / $23,600
- 5.25% on income up to $13,900 / $27,900
- 5.5% on income up to $80,650 / $161,550
- 6% on income up to $215,400 / $323,200
- 6.85% on income up to $1,077,550 / $2,155,350
- 9.65% on income up to $5,000,000 / $5,000,000
- 10.3% on income up to $25,000,000 / $25,000,000
- 10.9% on income over $25,000,000

**New York City Residents Pay Additional NYC Income Tax:**
- 3.078% to 3.876% depending on income
- Yonkers residents: Additional 1.477% (earned income) or 16.75% of state tax (other income)

**Bottom line:** Military retirement is exempt, but if you work after retiring, you'll pay state (and possibly NYC/Yonkers) income tax on civilian wages. For high earners in NYC, combined state + city rates reach 14%+.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: **100% exempt federally and in all states**
- New York: Not taxed (disability compensation is never taxed anywhere)

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- New York taxation: **$0—Survivor Benefit Plan payments are exempt** (military retirement income)
- Federal: Taxed federally

Surviving spouses receiving SBP pay zero New York state income tax on those payments.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Taxable by New York unless on active duty orders for 120+ days
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; New York doesn't tax it either
- **Active duty pay:** Not taxed by NY if you maintain out-of-state residency under SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act)

### Non-Military Retirement Income

New York provides a **$20,000 exemption** for pension and annuity income for taxpayers age 59½ and older:

- **$20,000 per person** ($40,000 for married couples filing jointly)
- Applies to: Private pensions, 401(k), IRA, annuities
- Does NOT include: Military/government pensions (already exempt), Social Security (see below)

This is useful if you have both military retirement (fully exempt) and a civilian pension (first $20,000 exempt).

### Social Security Benefits

- **New York does not tax Social Security benefits** (state-level exemption)
- Federal: Social Security may be partially taxable federally depending on income

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: Registration fees apply; **fee exemption only for specific disabled veterans**
- Parking: Disabled veteran plates provide parking privileges at meters and restricted zones
- Annual savings: $32-$60 (registration) + parking benefits

**Registration Fee Exemptions:**

Veterans can be exempt from registration fees and vehicle plate fees if they:
- Are disabled veterans who received a motor vehicle under **Federal Title 38** (Automobiles and Adaptive Equipment for Certain Disabled Veterans)
- Qualify for **Congressional Medal of Honor** custom plates
- Qualify for **Former Prisoner of War** custom plates

**Important:** Simply being 100% disabled does NOT automatically qualify you for fee exemption—you must meet the specific criteria above (vehicle provided by VA under Title 38, Medal of Honor, or POW status).

**Disabled Veteran Plates (with parking privileges):**

Veterans who are "severely disabled" (as defined in Section 404-a(4) of Vehicle and Traffic Law) may apply for Disabled Veteran plates:
- Provides parking privileges for persons with disabilities
- Can be used on vehicles weighing 6,999 pounds or less (except motorcycles)
- When renewing, you pay only the annual registration fee (no additional plate fees)

**New York State Thruway Exemption:**

Qualifying disabled veterans who obtain a fee-exempt vehicle registration from NY DMV may enroll in the **Disabled Veteran Non-Revenue E-ZPass Program**, which provides:
- **Free, unlimited travel** on the New York State Thruway
- Significant savings for veterans who commute or travel frequently

**Application:** Apply through NY DMV for disabled veteran plates, then enroll in Thruway program.

**Annual savings:** $32-$60 registration fees + $100-$500+ in Thruway tolls (if frequently used).

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **4% state + 4%-5% local = 8%-8.875% combined**
- Vehicle purchases: Taxable (sales tax applies)
- Goods and services: Taxable at combined rate

New York does NOT offer sales tax exemptions for veterans on vehicle purchases or general goods. Sales tax rates vary by county:

- **New York City:** 8.875% (4% state + 4.5% NYC + 0.375% MTA surcharge)
- **Nassau/Suffolk (Long Island):** 8.625-8.875%
- **Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess:** 8.375-8.625%
- **Upstate counties:** 8%-8.75%

**Example:** Buying a $40,000 vehicle in NYC:
- Sales tax: $3,550 (8.875%)
- **No veteran exemption available**

This is a disadvantage compared to states like Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Delaware, and Alaska (no sales tax), or states offering veteran sales tax exemptions.

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% Disabled Veteran (Nassau County, $600,000 home, $70,000 military retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $8,750 (75% exemption, capped at $100,000 assessed value)
- Income tax saved (vs. California 9.3%): $6,510
- Vehicle registration saved: $60 (if qualified for fee exemption)
- Thruway tolls saved: $300 (if enrolled)
- **Total Annual Savings vs. CA (taxing state with no exemption): $15,620**
- **Total annual savings vs. non-exempt NY resident: $9,110**

**Remaining costs:** Still pay $3,850/year property tax + 8.875% sales tax + civilian income tax if working.

**70% Disabled Veteran (Albany, $296,000 home, $50,000 military retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $4,500 (60% exemption, capped at $30,000 assessed)
- Income tax saved (vs. PA 3.07%): $1,535
- **Total annual savings: $6,035**

**Wartime Veteran, No Disability (Rochester, $175,000 home, $45,000 retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $735 (15% exemption, capped at $15,000 assessed)
- Income tax saved: $1,382
- **Total annual savings: $2,117**

**Military Retiree (NYC, $909,000 condo, $80,000 retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $0 (no disability rating)
- Income tax saved (vs. NJ 6.37%): $5,096
- **Total annual savings: $5,096**

The biggest benefit in New York is for military retirees (100% income exemption). Disabled veterans get moderate property tax relief, but not as generous as top veteran states.

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled Veteran (Nassau County):**
- Annual savings (vs. California): $15,620
- 20-year total: $312,400
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $232,500

**70% Disabled Veteran (Albany):**
- Annual savings: $6,035
- 20-year total: $120,700
- NPV: $89,900

**Military Retiree (No Disability, NYC):**
- Annual savings: $5,096
- 20-year total: $101,920
- NPV: $75,900

Over 20 years, a 100% disabled veteran in downstate NY saves over $300,000 compared to California—but still pays $77,000+ in property taxes.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $70K Retirement, $500K Home) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **New York** | Exempt (full exemption) | 50-75% reduction (local caps) | $15,000 (vs. CA) |
| New Jersey | Partially exempt ($100K) | $250 deduction | $2,500 |
| Connecticut | Partially exempt (75% up to $45K) | $1,500 exemption | $3,500 |
| Pennsylvania | Exempt (full exemption) | No state program (local varies) | $8,000 |
| Massachusetts | Exempt (full exemption) | $750-$1,000 exemption | $3,000 |
| Vermont | Partially exempt (40% up to $40K) | $40,000 exemption | $5,000 |

**Verdict:** New York ranks **2nd** among Northeastern states for military retirees (tied with PA and MA for full retirement exemption), but **mid-tier** for disabled veterans due to limited property tax relief compared to Florida, Texas, or New Hampshire.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** **Top tier**—full exemption for military retirement
- **Property tax exemption:** **Mid-tier**—partial exemptions with caps; no full exemption for 100% disabled
- **Sales tax:** **Below average**—8-9% combined rates with no veteran exemptions
- **Overall ranking:** **Top 15-20 nationally** for military retirees; **Top 25-30** for disabled veterans

Studies rank New York between 15th-20th best state for military retirees (strong due to income tax exemption) and 25th-35th for disabled veterans (limited property tax relief).

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- **Military retirees with high pensions** (save $4,000-$10,000/year on income tax exemption)
- **Disabled veterans living downstate** (higher property tax rates = larger exemption savings)
- **Veterans moving from high-tax states** (NJ, CT, CA, IL)
- **Disabled veterans who frequently use NY Thruway** (free tolls with E-ZPass program)
- **Veterans with civilian jobs + military retirement** (military pension exempt; only civilian income taxed)

**Less beneficial for:**
- **Veterans without disability ratings** (only 15% property tax reduction for wartime service)
- **50-70% disabled veterans in upstate** (lower property values + caps = minimal savings)
- **Veterans prioritizing low overall taxes** (NYC/downstate has very high cost of living, sales tax, property tax)
- **100% disabled veterans expecting full property tax exemption** (NY caps exemptions; other states offer 100%)

**Better options:**
- If you're 100% disabled and want full property tax exemption: **Florida, Texas, New Hampshire, Oklahoma**
- If you want lower cost of living + military retirement exemption: **Pennsylvania, Tennessee, South Carolina**
- If you want zero sales tax: **Delaware, Montana, Oregon**

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- New York estate tax: **Yes—estates over $6,940,000 (2025) are taxed**
- Tax rate: 3.06% to 16% depending on estate size
- Veteran exemptions: **None** (applies equally to veterans and non-veterans)

New York is one of 12 states with an estate tax. This is a disadvantage for estate planning compared to states with no estate tax.

### Pending Legislation (2025)

**Senate Bill S1183 / Assembly Bill A74:**

Proposes to establish a **full property tax exemption** for 100% service-connected disabled veterans on their primary residence.

**Key provisions:**
- 100% property tax exemption (no cap) for 100% disabled veterans
- **Local option:** Counties, cities, towns, villages, or school districts may adopt—not mandatory statewide
- **Status:** Introduced repeatedly since 2015; has not passed

**Senate Bill S3128:**

Proposes to allow **private employers** to adopt voluntary veterans' hiring preference policies (currently only public employers can).

**Status:** Introduced January 2025; pending.

**Bottom line:** New York has considered improving veteran benefits, but legislation has stalled. Until passed, existing exemptions remain limited.

### Veterans Tuition Award (VTA)

While not a tax benefit, New York offers a significant education benefit:

- **Free tuition** at SUNY and community colleges for eligible veterans (up to undergraduate in-state tuition)
- **Eligibility (expanded July 1, 2025):** Minimum 4 years active duty service, New York resident
- **Duration:** Up to 8 semesters (4 years)
- **Value:** $6,960-$15,990/year depending on school

This partially offsets New York's limited property tax benefits and is an excellent benefit for veterans pursuing education.

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Apply for property tax exemption immediately after establishing residency.** File by March 15 to receive benefit starting July 1. Don't miss the deadline—you'll lose a full year of savings ($5,000-$10,000+).

2. **Check your local municipality's exemption caps.** Contact your county, town, and village assessors to confirm the maximum exemption amount. Some municipalities have higher caps than others.

3. **If 100% disabled, apply for disabled veteran license plates.** Get parking privileges + potential fee exemptions + free Thruway tolls (if qualified).

4. **Enroll in NY Thruway E-ZPass program** (if you have fee-exempt registration). Save hundreds per year on tolls.

5. **Verify DFAS is NOT withholding NY state income tax** from military retirement. Your military pension is tax-exempt—don't overpay.

6. **Consider upstate vs. downstate carefully.** Downstate has much higher property taxes (and higher exemption savings), but extremely high cost of living. Upstate offers affordable housing but lower exemption savings.

7. **Use SONYMA Homes for Veterans program** if buying a home. Offers mortgages with 0.375% lower interest rates + down payment assistance up to $15,000 for veterans.

8. **Apply for Veterans Tuition Award** if pursuing education (or your dependents). Free tuition at SUNY schools.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not filing property tax exemption by March 15:** You lose the entire tax year. In Nassau County, that's $8,000+ lost.

- **Assuming 100% disabled = full property tax exemption:** New York caps exemptions at 50-75% of assessed value (with dollar caps). You'll still pay property tax.

- **Not checking municipal caps:** Exemption amounts vary dramatically by location. Always confirm with your local assessor.

- **Paying NY income tax on military retirement:** Military pensions are 100% exempt. If DFAS is withholding NY tax, file Form IT-2104 to stop withholding.

- **Not applying for Thruway E-ZPass if you're eligible:** Free tolls save $300-$1,000/year for frequent drivers.

- **Overlooking the Cold War Exemption:** If you served 1945-1991 but don't qualify for Alternative Veterans' Exemption, you may still get 10-15% reduction under Cold War Exemption.

- **Forgetting to apply in NYC:** If you live in one of the five boroughs, apply through NYC Department of Finance, not a county assessor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I pay state income tax on my military retirement in New York?**

A: No. Military retirement pay is 100% exempt from New York state income tax, NYC income tax, and Yonkers income tax. There's no cap or limit.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled. Do I qualify for full property tax exemption?**

A: No. New York offers a partial exemption (up to 50-75% reduction in assessed value), not a full 100% exemption. Pending legislation (S1183) would create a full exemption, but it hasn't passed and requires local municipalities to opt in.

**Q: What's the difference between Alternative Veterans' Exemption and Cold War Exemption?**

A: Alternative Veterans' Exemption requires wartime service or expeditionary medal (15-25% base reduction + disability). Cold War Exemption covers service between 1945-1991 (10-15% reduction + disability) but has a 10-year limit unless made indefinite by the municipality.

**Q: Can I get both Alternative Veterans' Exemption and Cold War Exemption?**

A: No. You typically choose whichever provides greater benefit. Most veterans use Alternative Veterans' Exemption.

**Q: My home is assessed at $400,000. I'm 100% disabled. What will I save?**

A: It depends on your municipality's caps. If you qualify for 75% exemption (25% base + 50% disability), you'd exempt $300,000 of assessed value. But if your municipality caps exemptions at $50,000, you only exempt $50,000. Check with your local assessor for specific caps.

**Q: Does the property tax exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. Only your primary residence qualifies.

**Q: I'm rated 80% disabled. How much will I save?**

A: 15% (wartime) + 10% (combat) + 40% (half of 80%) = 65% reduction in assessed value, subject to your municipality's caps. Typical savings: $4,000-$7,000 annually depending on location.

**Q: Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption if I die?**

A: Yes. The exemption transfers to an unremarried surviving spouse in most cases. Verify with your local assessor.

**Q: Do I get free vehicle registration if I'm 100% disabled?**

A: Only if you meet specific criteria: received vehicle under Federal Title 38, Medal of Honor recipient, or Former POW. Simply being 100% disabled doesn't automatically qualify for free registration, but you may qualify for disabled veteran plates with parking privileges.

**Q: Does New York tax Social Security benefits?**

A: No. New York does not tax Social Security benefits.

**Q: I'm active duty stationed in New York but my home of record is Florida. Do I pay NY taxes?**

A: No. Under SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act), you maintain Florida residency and pay no NY income tax on military pay. However, if your spouse works in NY, their income may be subject to NY tax.

**Q: What if I move from one county to another within New York?**

A: You need to reapply for the exemption with your new county/municipality. The exemption doesn't automatically transfer.

**Q: Are there local income taxes in New York?**

A: Yes. **New York City** residents pay additional city income tax (3.078%-3.876%). **Yonkers** residents pay additional city income tax (1.477% on earned income or 16.75% of state tax on unearned income). Most other NY municipalities do not have local income taxes.

**Q: I receive both military retirement and VA disability. Are both exempt?**

A: Yes. Military retirement is 100% exempt from NY state tax. VA disability compensation is tax-free federally and in all states.

**Q: How much do I save on sales tax living in New York?**

A: You don't. New York charges 8-8.875% sales tax with no veteran exemptions. This is a disadvantage compared to no-sales-tax states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon).

**Q: Can I get both the property tax exemption and free Thruway tolls?**

A: Yes, if you qualify. Get disabled veteran plates with fee-exempt registration, then enroll in the NY Thruway Disabled Veteran E-ZPass program for free tolls.

**Q: I served during peacetime (not wartime). Do I qualify for anything?**

A: Potentially the Cold War Exemption if you served between 1945-1991. Otherwise, you won't qualify for Alternative Veterans' Exemption unless you received an expeditionary medal.

**Q: Does the exemption reduce my school taxes, county taxes, or both?**

A: It depends on which jurisdictions adopt the exemption. Most municipalities (county, town, village, school district) participate, but verify with your local assessor. The exemption typically applies to all participating taxing jurisdictions.
