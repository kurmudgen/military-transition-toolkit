### Complementary Features:
1. **VA claims builder** - What Hire Heroes doesn't offer

### Positioning:
- **"Career placement + complete transition"** - HH gets you the job, MTT handles rest of life
- **"Community + coaching"** - Peer support supplements professional coaching
- **"Tools while you wait"** - Use MTT during HH waitlist period

### Partnership Opportunity:
Hire Heroes already partners with O2O for job placement. **MTT could partner with HH** to provide:
- VA claims support for their clients
- Community forum for peer connection
- Transition checklist integration
- Post-employment support

### Key Insight:
HH users are **job-focused but have broader needs**. They still need VA claims, state benefits, housing, healthcare. MTT can **complement HH** by handling non-career transition needs.

**Strategic angle:** Position as **"Hire Heroes' comprehensive transition partner"** - they get you the job, we handle everything else.
