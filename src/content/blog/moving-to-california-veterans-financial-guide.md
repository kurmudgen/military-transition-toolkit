# Moving to California for Veterans: Financial Guide and Complete Cost Analysis 2025

California attracts military retirees and transitioning service members despite its reputation for high costs. The combination of mild climate, robust job market, excellent VA healthcare, and military-heavy communities creates attraction. However, California is expensive—understanding total costs is essential for financial planning.

## California Veteran Tax Considerations

**Military Pension Tax Exemption:**
- Up to $75,000 of military retirement pension exempt from California income tax
- Amount applies per servicemember
- Survivor benefit plan (SBP) also eligible
- Must have served on active duty

**California Income Tax on Other Income:**
- State income tax rate: 9.3-13.3% depending on income
- Top rate applies to incomes over $662,000
- Capital gains tax: same as ordinary income
- Sales tax: 7.25-8.625% (varies by county)

**Tax Impact Example:**
Retiree with $50,000 pension + $30,000 other income:
- Pension tax (first $75,000 exempt): $0
- Other income tax (13.3%): $3,990
- Effective tax rate: 5.3%

**If relocated from no-income-tax state:**
This represents $3,990 annual NEW tax burden—significant consideration.
