# VA Disability Rating for Vertigo: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Vertigo and vestibular disorders are rated under **Diagnostic Codes 6204** (peripheral vestibular disorders) or **6205** (Meniere's disease) with ratings from **10% to 100%**. The key criteria are **frequency of dizziness episodes** and whether **cerebellar gait** (staggering) is present. Vertigo is commonly secondary to **TBI**, **hearing loss**, and **tinnitus**, or caused directly by **blast exposure** or **acoustic trauma**. The critical evidence is documenting **episode frequency** and **functional impact**. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Vertigo?

Vertigo is the sensation that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving. It's caused by problems with the inner ear or brain's balance system.

**Types:**
- **Peripheral vertigo**: Inner ear problems (most common)
- **Central vertigo**: Brain/brainstem problems
- **BPPV** (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo): Most common type
- **Meniere's disease**: Vertigo with hearing loss and tinnitus
- **Labyrinthitis/Vestibular neuritis**: Inner ear inflammation

**Symptoms:**
- Spinning sensation
- Dizziness
- Nausea/vomiting
- Balance problems (staggering gait)
- Falls
- Difficulty focusing eyes

**Military connections:**
- Blast exposure/TBI
- Acoustic trauma
- Head injuries
- Ear infections during service
- Barotrauma (diving, flying)
- Toxic exposures affecting vestibular system

## VA Rating Criteria

### DC 6204 - Peripheral Vestibular Disorders

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Occasional dizziness |
| **30%** | Dizziness and occasional staggering |

### DC 6205 - Meniere's Syndrome (Endolymphatic Hydrops)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **30%** | Hearing impairment with vertigo less than once a month, with or without tinnitus |
| **60%** | Hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring from 1-4 times monthly, with or without tinnitus |
| **100%** | Hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring more than once weekly, with or without tinnitus |

**Note:** Meniere's disease includes hearing loss, vertigo, and often tinnitus together.

### DC 8045 - TBI with Vestibular Dysfunction

If vertigo is caused by TBI, it may be rated under the TBI diagnostic code (DC 8045), which evaluates vestibular disturbance as one of the 10 facets.

### Understanding Key Terms

**Cerebellar Gait**: Staggering, unsteady walking pattern—like being drunk. This is critical for higher Meniere's ratings.

**Attack of Vertigo**: Episode of significant dizziness/spinning that impairs function.

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing dizziness/vertigo
- Blast exposure documentation
- TBI history
- Hearing loss records (often associated)
- Buddy statements about in-service symptoms

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- ENT (otolaryngologist) evaluation
- Audiological evaluation
- Vestibular testing:
  - **Electronystagmography (ENG)**
  - **Videonystagmography (VNG)**
  - **Rotary chair testing**
  - **Posturography**
- MRI (to rule out central causes)

### Severity Evidence
- **Vertigo diary**: Log every episode with date, duration, and impact
- Documentation of staggering/gait problems
- Falls documented
- Treatment records
- Work limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review vestibular and hearing history
2. Perform physical examination
3. Assess balance and gait
4. Look for nystagmus (eye movements)
5. Review vestibular testing results
6. Document episode frequency

**What to tell them:**
- How often you have vertigo episodes
- How long episodes last
- Whether you stagger when walking
- Falls or near-falls
- Impact on driving, work, daily life
- Nausea/vomiting with episodes
- Any hearing loss or tinnitus

**Keep a vertigo diary:** Document every episode with:
- Date and time
- Duration
- Severity (scale 1-10)
- Triggers (if any)
- Impact (couldn't work, couldn't drive, fell)

## Secondary Conditions

**Vertigo can be secondary to:**
- TBI (very common)
- Tinnitus
- Hearing loss
- Ear surgery complications
- Medications

**Vertigo can cause:**
- Falls/injuries (claim secondary injuries)
- Depression/anxiety
- Inability to work
- Social isolation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between DC 6204 and DC 6205?
DC 6204 is for general vestibular disorders (max 30%). DC 6205 is specifically for Meniere's disease (with hearing loss and tinnitus, max 100%). Meniere's provides higher potential ratings.

### Do I need vestibular testing?
Vestibular function tests (VNG, ENG) provide objective evidence supporting your diagnosis and can help establish severity. While not always required, they strengthen your claim.

### Can I claim vertigo secondary to TBI?
Yes. Vestibular dysfunction is one of the most common TBI symptoms. The nexus is well-established medically.

### What if I have vertigo and tinnitus?
If you have Meniere's disease, vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus are all part of the same condition and rated together under DC 6205. If they're separate conditions, they may be rated separately (but watch for pyramiding issues).

### How do I document cerebellar gait?
Describe staggering, unsteady walking, needing to hold onto walls/furniture, and any falls. Video evidence can be helpful. Have family members provide buddy statements describing your gait.

### Can vertigo be rated 100%?
Yes, under DC 6205 (Meniere's disease) if you have hearing impairment with vertigo attacks and cerebellar gait more than once weekly.
