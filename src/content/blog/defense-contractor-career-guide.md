# Defense Contractor Jobs for Veterans: Complete Career Guide (2025)

Defense contracting offers veterans a unique opportunity: continue supporting the mission, use your security clearance, work in a familiar military culture, and earn competitive private-sector salaries. Many veterans find this the smoothest transition path from military to civilian life.

This guide covers how to break into defense contracting, top employers, salary expectations, and strategies to maximize your earning potential.

## Why Defense Contracting for Veterans?

### The Advantages

**Your Clearance is Gold**: An active clearance costs companies $15,000-$50,000 and 6-18 months. You bring it with you for free.

**Familiar Culture**: Defense contractors work alongside military. You'll understand the environment, terminology, and mission.

**Higher Salaries**: Private sector typically pays more than equivalent GS positions, especially for cleared roles.

**Use Your Expertise**: Your military MOS/rate/AFSC experience applies directly to many contractor positions.

**Flexible Career Growth**: Move between projects, companies, and locations as opportunities arise.

### Clearance Value

Your clearance provides immediate earning power:

| Clearance Level | Salary Premium | Approximate Value |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Secret | $5,000-$15,000 | $15,000-$25,000 (cost to sponsor) |
| Top Secret | $15,000-$30,000 | $30,000-$50,000 |
| TS/SCI | $20,000-$40,000 | $40,000-$80,000 |
| TS/SCI with Poly | $30,000-$50,000+ | $80,000-$100,000+ |

**Critical**: Your clearance lapses 24 months after separation if not sponsored. Get a cleared job before it expires.
