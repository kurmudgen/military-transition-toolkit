# VA Disability Rating for Gulf War Syndrome: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Gulf War Syndrome refers to a cluster of unexplained chronic symptoms affecting veterans who served in Southwest Asia. Under **38 CFR § 3.317**, Gulf War veterans can receive service connection for **undiagnosed illnesses** and **medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illnesses (MUCMI)** without proving a direct nexus. Key presumptive conditions include **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome**, **Fibromyalgia**, and **Functional GI Disorders (IBS)**. Symptoms must have manifested **by December 31, 2026** and be **10% or more disabling** to qualify. This is one of the most veteran-friendly areas of VA law—file your claim if you have unexplained symptoms.

## What Is Gulf War Syndrome?

Gulf War Syndrome (also called Gulf War Illness) is a term for the complex of unexplained symptoms many Gulf War veterans experience. These symptoms affect multiple body systems but often can't be attributed to a specific diagnosis.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Fatigue
- Muscle and joint pain
- Headaches
- Memory and concentration problems
- Skin problems (rashes)
- Respiratory symptoms
- Gastrointestinal issues
- Sleep disturbances
- Mood changes

## VA Rating Criteria

### Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (DC 6354)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Symptoms that wax and wane, incapacitating episodes 1-2 weeks per year, or controlled by medication |
| **20%** | Nearly constant symptoms restricting activities <25% of pre-illness level, or incapacitating episodes 2-4 weeks per year |
| **40%** | Nearly constant symptoms restricting activities to 50-75% of pre-illness level, or incapacitating episodes 4-6 weeks per year |
| **60%** | Nearly constant symptoms restricting activities to <50% of pre-illness level, or incapacitating episodes 6+ weeks per year |
| **100%** | Symptoms nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine activities almost completely |

### Fibromyalgia (DC 5025)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Widespread pain and tender points requiring continuous medication |
| **20%** | Episodic symptoms present more than 1/3 of the time |
| **40%** | Constant or nearly constant symptoms refractory to treatment |

### IBS/Functional GI Disorders (DC 7319)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mild disturbances, infrequent episodes |
| **10%** | Moderate; frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress |
| **30%** | Severe; diarrhea or alternating diarrhea/constipation with more or less constant abdominal distress |

### Undiagnosed Illness
Rated by analogy to most closely related diagnosed condition under 38 CFR § 4.20.

## Evidence You Need

### For All Gulf War Claims
- DD-214 showing service in qualifying location
- Documentation of when symptoms began
- Medical records showing evaluation and treatment

### For Undiagnosed Illness
- Medical records showing symptoms cannot be attributed to known diagnosis
- Objective evidence of symptoms (not just subjective complaints)
- Chronic duration (6+ months)
- Impact on function

### For MUCMI (CFS, Fibromyalgia, IBS)
- Specific diagnosis from physician
- Documentation meeting diagnostic criteria
- Chronic symptoms (6+ months)

### Helpful Evidence
- Buddy statements describing symptoms
- Employment records showing decline
- Personal statement documenting symptom history

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review service in Southwest Asia
2. Document all symptoms
3. Determine if symptoms can be attributed to known diagnosis
4. If diagnosable, provide specific diagnosis
5. If not diagnosable, document as undiagnosed illness
6. Assess severity

**What to tell them:**
- All symptoms, even if seemingly unrelated
- When symptoms began
- How symptoms affect daily life
- Connection to Gulf War service
- Any exposures during service

**Be Comprehensive:** Gulf War Syndrome involves multiple symptoms. Don't focus on just one—describe the full picture.

## Exposures During Gulf War Service

Document any exposures you experienced:

- **Smoke from oil well fires**
- **Depleted uranium**
- **Pesticides**
- **Chemical warfare agents (Khamisiyah)**
- **Vaccines (anthrax, botulinum)**
- **Burn pits**
- **Sand/dust**
- **Diesel exhaust**
- **Contaminated water**
- **Infectious diseases**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the deadline for Gulf War presumptive claims?
Symptoms must have manifested by **December 31, 2026** to qualify for presumptive service connection under 38 CFR § 3.317. Congress may extend this date.

### Do I need a specific diagnosis?
**No.** That's the key benefit of Gulf War presumptions. You can receive service connection for undiagnosed illnesses—symptoms that can't be attributed to a known diagnosis.

### What if my symptoms are diagnosed?
If diagnosed with a specific condition, you may still qualify:
- If diagnosed with a MUCMI (CFS, fibromyalgia, IBS): presumptive service connection
- If diagnosed with another condition: may need nexus opinion to service

### What does "10% disabling" mean?
Your symptoms must meet or exceed the criteria for a 10% rating under VA rating schedules. Even if rated by analogy for undiagnosed illness, must reach 10% threshold.

### Can I claim if I served after 9/11?
**Yes.** The Gulf War period is ongoing. Veterans who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other Southwest Asia locations after 9/11 qualify.

### What about PACT Act conditions?
The PACT Act added additional presumptive conditions (mostly respiratory and cancers) for Gulf War veterans. These are separate from the 38 CFR § 3.317 undiagnosed illness provisions. You may qualify under both.

### What if I was previously denied?
If denied previously, consider filing a supplemental claim with additional evidence, especially if:
- Your condition is now diagnosed as a MUCMI
- You have new medical evidence
- The presumptive period was extended

## Common Denial Reasons and Appeals

### Denial Reasons
1. Symptoms attributed to known diagnosis
2. Symptoms not shown to be chronic (6+ months)
3. Service in Southwest Asia not documented
4. Symptoms not shown to be 10% disabling
5. Symptoms manifested after presumptive deadline

### Appeal Strategies
- Obtain specialist evaluation questioning attributed diagnosis
- Gather evidence of chronic, ongoing symptoms
- Document functional limitations supporting 10%+ rating
- Obtain buddy statements corroborating symptoms since service
