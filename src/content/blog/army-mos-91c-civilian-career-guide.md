## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest about civilian skills you don't have:

**Customer service and sales:** Residential HVAC techs sell equipment replacements, system upgrades, and maintenance agreements. Commercial techs interact with facility managers and building owners. You need to explain technical issues in layman's terms, provide accurate estimates, and build trust—very different from military equipment maintenance where you just fix it.

**Business operations (if going independent):** Running an HVAC business requires invoicing, licensing, insurance, marketing, customer acquisition, tax planning, and employee management. Many 91Cs have technical skills but struggle with business side. Take small business courses or partner with someone who handles administration.

**Code compliance:** Civilian HVAC work must comply with building codes, electrical codes, and local regulations. Inspections and permits are required for many installations. You'll need to learn code requirements for your area—military maintenance doesn't have these constraints.

**Modern building automation and smart systems:** New construction uses computerized building management systems (BMS), smart thermostats, and IoT-connected equipment. These are more advanced than military systems. You'll learn on the job, but expect 6-12 month learning curve.

**Residential customer dynamics:** Homeowners are emotional about their homes and often don't understand HVAC. You'll encounter price objections, unrealistic expectations, and blame for pre-existing problems. Develop patience, communication skills, and professional boundaries.
