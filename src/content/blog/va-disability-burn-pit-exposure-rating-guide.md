# VA Disability Rating for Burn Pit Exposure (PACT Act): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The **PACT Act** (Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022) is the largest expansion of VA benefits in decades, adding **23+ presumptive conditions** for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances. If you served in qualifying locations and develop a presumptive condition, **you don't need to prove the connection**—service connection is presumed. Key conditions include **respiratory cancers**, **chronic respiratory diseases**, and **constrictive bronchiolitis**. The law also extends the presumptive period and toxic exposure screening for all veterans. **File your claim now**—many conditions can be backdated to the PACT Act's effective date if filed within certain timeframes.

## What Is the PACT Act?

The **Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act** became law on August 10, 2022. It:

1. **Adds 23+ presumptive conditions** for toxic-exposed veterans
2. **Expands Agent Orange presumptions** to new locations and conditions
3. **Creates toxic exposure screening** for all veterans in VA care
4. **Removes requirement to enroll within 5 years** for combat veterans
5. **Expands eligibility for VA health care** for toxic-exposed veterans

## Rating Your Condition

Each presumptive condition is rated under its specific diagnostic code:

### Respiratory Conditions (DC 6600-6847)

**Asthma (DC 6602):**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | FEV-1 of 71-80% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 71-80%; or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy |
| **30%** | FEV-1 of 56-70% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 56-70%; or daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy; or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication |
| **60%** | FEV-1 of 40-55% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 40-55%; or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations; or intermittent (at least 3 per year) courses of systemic corticosteroids |
| **100%** | FEV-1 less than 40% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC less than 40%; or more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure; or daily use of systemic corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications |

**COPD/Chronic Bronchitis (DC 6600):**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | FEV-1 of 71-80% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 71-80%; or DLCO (SB) 66-80% predicted |
| **30%** | FEV-1 of 56-70% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 56-70%; or DLCO (SB) 56-65% predicted |
| **60%** | FEV-1 of 40-55% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 40-55%; or DLCO (SB) 40-55% predicted; or maximum oxygen consumption of 15-20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit) |
| **100%** | FEV-1 less than 40% predicted; or FEV-1/FVC less than 40%; or DLCO (SB) less than 40% predicted; or maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation); or cor pulmonale; or right heart failure; or need for outpatient oxygen therapy |

### Cancers

Cancer ratings vary by type, treatment status, and residuals:
- **Active cancer**: Often rated 100% during treatment
- **Post-treatment**: Rated based on residuals
- Each cancer has specific diagnostic codes and criteria

## Evidence You Need

### For Presumptive Conditions
- DD-214 showing service in qualifying location
- Current diagnosis of presumptive condition
- **NO nexus letter required** for presumptive conditions

### For Non-Presumptive Conditions
- Service in toxic exposure location
- Diagnosis of condition
- **Nexus opinion** linking condition to exposure

### Severity Evidence
- Pulmonary function tests (for respiratory conditions)
- Treatment records
- Imaging studies
- Pathology reports (for cancers)

## Key PACT Act Dates

### August 10, 2022
- PACT Act signed into law
- Cancers become presumptive immediately

### October 1, 2022
- Respiratory conditions become presumptive

### Effective Dates for Claims
- If you file within certain timeframes, effective dates may go back to the law's enactment
- **File as soon as possible** to preserve earliest effective date

## Toxic Exposure Screening

The PACT Act requires VA to screen all veterans for toxic exposure during health care appointments. This includes:
- Questions about service locations
- Potential exposure assessment
- Referral for evaluation if needed

**If you haven't been screened**, request a toxic exposure screening at your next VA appointment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a nexus letter for PACT Act conditions?
**No**, for presumptive conditions. You only need to prove you served in a qualifying location and have a current diagnosis of a presumptive condition.

### What if my condition isn't on the presumptive list?
You can still file a claim with a nexus opinion linking your condition to toxic exposure. The presumptive list is not exhaustive.

### Can I file if I was already denied?
**Yes.** If you were previously denied for a condition now presumptive under the PACT Act, file a supplemental claim. Many previously denied claims can now be approved.

### Do I need proof of burn pit exposure?
For presumptive conditions, you only need proof of service in qualifying locations. Specific burn pit exposure documentation is helpful but not required.

### What about conditions not yet diagnosed?
Enroll in VA health care and request a toxic exposure screening. The VA can evaluate you for conditions related to your service.

### Can survivors file claims?
Yes. Surviving family members can file Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) claims for veterans whose death resulted from presumptive conditions.

### What if I served before 9/11?
The PACT Act also expanded Agent Orange presumptions and added conditions for earlier service periods. Gulf War veterans (August 2, 1990+) are covered.
