# VA Rating for Anxiety: Compensation Rates and Criteria (2025)

Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions affecting veterans. If you're struggling with anxiety related to your military service, you may be entitled to significant VA disability compensation—potentially up to $3,906.04 per month.

But here's what most veterans don't know: the VA rates anxiety using the same criteria as PTSD, depression, and other mental health conditions. The difference is in how you prove service connection.

This guide covers everything you need to get the anxiety rating you deserve.

## How the VA Rates Anxiety Disorders

All mental health conditions—anxiety, PTSD, depression, bipolar disorder—are rated under the same General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (38 CFR § 4.130). Your rating depends on how severely your symptoms affect your occupational and social functioning.

### Anxiety Rating Criteria

| Rating | Monthly Pay (2025) | Criteria Summary |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **0%** | $0 | Diagnosis confirmed, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with functioning or require continuous medication |
| **10%** | $175.51 | Mild symptoms causing slight occupational and social impairment |
| **30%** | $524.31 | Occasional decrease in work efficiency; symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **50%** | $1,110.55 | Reduced reliability and productivity; difficulty establishing relationships |
| **70%** | $1,716.28 | Deficiencies in most areas; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances |
| **100%** | $3,906.04 | Total occupational and social impairment |

### Detailed Rating Descriptions

- Disorientation to time or place
- Memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name

## Anxiety vs. PTSD: What's the Difference?

Many veterans wonder whether to claim anxiety or PTSD. Here's the key distinction:

**PTSD requires:**
- A specific traumatic stressor event
- Re-experiencing symptoms (nightmares, flashbacks)
- Avoidance of trauma reminders
- Hyperarousal symptoms

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder requires:**
- Persistent, excessive worry about various aspects of life
- Difficulty controlling worry
- Physical symptoms (restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, sleep problems)
- No specific traumatic event necessary

**Bottom line**: If your anxiety stems from a specific traumatic event, you may have both PTSD and anxiety. If your anxiety is generalized and not tied to specific trauma, claim anxiety disorder.

**Important**: The VA will only rate you once for mental health conditions. If you're service-connected for PTSD at 50% and also have anxiety, you won't get a separate rating for anxiety. The rating covers all mental health symptoms.

## Types of Anxiety Disorders the VA Rates

The VA recognizes several anxiety conditions:

- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** - Persistent worry about many things
- **Panic Disorder** - Recurrent panic attacks
- **Social Anxiety Disorder** - Fear of social situations
- **Specific Phobias** - Intense fear of specific objects/situations
- **Agoraphobia** - Fear of places where escape might be difficult
- **Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety** - Anxiety in response to identifiable stressor

All are rated using the same criteria—it's about symptom severity, not diagnosis type.

## Proving Service Connection for Anxiety

### Direct Service Connection

To establish direct service connection, you need:

1. **Current diagnosis** of anxiety disorder from qualified mental health professional
2. **In-service event or symptoms** documented in service treatment records
3. **Nexus** (medical opinion) linking current condition to service

**Evidence that helps:**
- Service treatment records showing anxiety symptoms, medication, or treatment
- Reports of stressors during service (combat, dangerous duties, sexual assault)
- Performance evaluations mentioning anxiety-related behaviors
- Buddy statements describing your anxiety symptoms during service

### Secondary Service Connection

Anxiety is commonly secondary to other service-connected conditions:

**Common primary conditions:**
- **Chronic pain** from back, knee, or shoulder injuries → anxiety about daily functioning
- **Sleep apnea** → sleep deprivation → anxiety symptoms
- **TBI** → neurological changes → anxiety disorder
- **Tinnitus** → constant ringing → anxiety and irritability
- **PTSD** → can have comorbid anxiety disorder
- **Chronic illness** → worry about health → generalized anxiety

**How to file secondary:**
If you already have a service-connected condition that's causing or worsening your anxiety, file anxiety as secondary to that condition. You'll need a nexus opinion explaining the connection.

### Aggravation Claims

If you had mild anxiety before service that got significantly worse during service, you may have an aggravation claim. The VA will rate based on the worsened portion of your condition.

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Current diagnosis** from psychiatrist, psychologist, or qualified mental health provider
2. **Treatment records** showing ongoing care (therapy sessions, medication management)
3. **Symptom documentation** describing frequency, severity, and impact on life
4. **GAF or other assessment scores** (if available from treatment)

### Lay Evidence

5. **Personal statement** describing:
   - When symptoms started
   - How service caused or worsened your anxiety
   - How symptoms affect daily life, work, relationships
   - Specific examples of anxiety episodes

6. **Buddy statements** from:
   - Fellow service members who witnessed your anxiety
   - Spouse/family describing changes they've observed
   - Coworkers noting occupational impairment

### For Secondary Claims

7. **Nexus letter** from qualified provider explaining how your service-connected condition causes or worsens anxiety
8. **Medical literature** supporting the connection

## C&P Exam for Anxiety

The mental health C&P exam is crucial. The examiner will assess your symptoms and provide an opinion on service connection and severity.

### What to Expect

**Duration**: 30-90 minutes

**Format**: Interview-style conversation about your history, symptoms, and functioning

**Examiner**: Psychiatrist, psychologist, or qualified mental health professional

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- When did your anxiety symptoms start?
- What symptoms do you experience?
- How often do you have panic attacks? (If applicable)
- How does anxiety affect your work?
- How does anxiety affect your relationships?
- What treatment have you received?
- What medications do you take?
- Have you had any hospitalizations for mental health?
- Do you have thoughts of suicide or self-harm?
- (For secondary claims) How does your [primary condition] affect your anxiety?

### How to Prepare

**Document your worst days**. Write down specific examples:
- "Last week I had a panic attack in the grocery store and had to leave my cart"
- "I haven't been able to maintain friendships since service"
- "I've been written up at work twice for snapping at coworkers"

**Don't minimize symptoms**. Many veterans downplay their struggles. Be honest about how bad it really is.

**Describe impact on functioning**. The examiner needs to understand how anxiety affects:
- Your job performance and attendance
- Your relationships (spouse, children, friends)
- Your daily activities
- Your ability to handle stress

**Bring documentation**:
- List of medications and dosages
- Names of all mental health providers
- Notes on specific anxiety episodes
- Buddy statements

### Common Mistakes

1. **Saying "I'm fine" or "I manage"** - The exam assesses impairment, not how tough you are
2. **Not disclosing the full picture** - If you've had suicidal thoughts, say so
3. **Presenting on a good day** - Describe your typical or worst functioning, not your best day
4. **Being vague** - Give specific examples with dates and details
5. **Not mentioning panic attacks** - Frequency of panic attacks directly affects your rating

## Increasing Your Anxiety Rating

If you're currently rated for anxiety but your symptoms have worsened, you can file for an increase.

### When to File

- Symptoms have objectively worsened since last rating
- New symptoms have developed
- You've been hospitalized for anxiety
- You've had to change/increase medications
- Your work or relationships have deteriorated
- You have new evidence supporting higher rating

### What You Need

1. **Recent medical evidence** showing worsening (within past 12 months)
2. **New buddy statements** describing current severity
3. **Personal statement** explaining how things have gotten worse
4. **Any new treatment records**, hospitalizations, or medication changes

### Rating Increase C&P Exam

The examiner will compare your current functioning to your previous rating and assess whether your condition has worsened. Be prepared to discuss specific changes since your last evaluation.

## Common Denial Reasons and How to Overcome Them

### "No current diagnosis"
**Solution**: Get diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional before filing. The VA needs a current diagnosis in your records.

### "No in-service event or nexus"
**Solution**: For direct claims, provide buddy statements, service records showing symptoms, or a nexus opinion. For secondary claims, provide nexus letter explaining the connection.

### "Symptoms attributed to non-service-connected cause"
**Solution**: Get medical opinion specifically addressing why your anxiety is related to service (not civilian stressors).

### "Not severe enough for compensable rating"
**Solution**: Document how symptoms affect daily functioning. Buddy statements describing occupational and social impairment are crucial.

## Anxiety Secondary Conditions

If you're service-connected for anxiety, you may be able to claim these as secondary:

- **Sleep disorders** (anxiety → insomnia → rated under sleep conditions)
- **GERD/IBS** (stress and anxiety worsen GI conditions)
- **Hypertension** (chronic anxiety contributes to high blood pressure)
- **Substance abuse** (if you developed dependence managing anxiety symptoms)
- **Erectile dysfunction** (anxiety and anxiety medications can cause ED)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I be rated for both anxiety and PTSD?
No. The VA only provides one rating for mental health conditions. You'll be rated based on your overall mental health impairment, which may include symptoms from multiple diagnoses.

### Does the VA rate anxiety differently than PTSD?
No. Both use the same rating criteria (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders). The difference is in how you prove service connection, not how symptoms are rated.

### What if I was diagnosed with anxiety before service?
You may still have a claim if military service permanently aggravated your pre-existing condition. You'll need medical evidence showing worsening.

### How long does an anxiety claim take?
Average is 4-6 months for initial claims. Mental health claims sometimes take longer due to C&P exam scheduling.

### Can I claim anxiety if I'm already service-connected for depression?
You likely already have symptoms counted. But if you have new/different symptoms, you can file for an increase to your mental health rating.

### What's the average rating for anxiety?
Most veterans receive 30% or 50% for anxiety. Higher ratings (70-100%) require significant documentation of severe occupational and social impairment.
