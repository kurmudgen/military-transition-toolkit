# How to Read Federal Job Announcements: A Veteran's Decoder Guide

Federal job announcements are written in bureaucratic code. Understanding that code separates veterans who get hired from those who waste months applying to jobs they'll never get.

Every announcement contains specific information about who can apply, what qualifications are required, and what the job actually involves. Miss one detail—like applying to a merit promotion announcement when you're external—and your application goes straight to rejection.

This guide decodes federal job announcements section by section, showing you exactly how to identify positions where you're competitive.

## The Anatomy of a Federal Job Announcement

Every USAJOBS announcement has the same basic structure:

1. **Overview** – Basic job information at a glance
2. **Duties** – What you'll actually do
3. **Requirements** – Qualifications, conditions of employment
4. **Evaluation** – How they'll assess your application
5. **Benefits** – Compensation and perks
6. **How to Apply** – Application instructions and deadlines

Let's decode each section.

## Section 1: The Overview

The overview gives you the critical facts at a glance. Here's what to look for:

### Position Title and Series
```
Management Analyst, GS-0343-12
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **Management Analyst** – Job title
- **GS** – General Schedule pay system
- **0343** – Occupational series number (tells you the job family)
- **12** – Grade level (pay grade)

**Common series for veterans:**
- 0080 – Security Administration
- 0301 – Miscellaneous Administration and Program
- 0343 – Management Analyst
- 0346 – Logistics Management
- 0391 – Telecommunications
- 1102 – Contract Specialist
- 1811 – Criminal Investigation
- 2210 – Information Technology

### Salary Range
```
$82,764 - $107,590 per year
```

This shows the full range from Step 1 to Step 10. Most new hires start at Step 1 unless they negotiate higher (which you can do).

### Location
```
Arlington, VA (1 vacancy)
Fort Meade, MD (2 vacancies)
Remote eligible (5 vacancies)
```

Location determines locality pay. The same GS-12 pays differently in DC vs. rural Nebraska.

### Open and Close Dates
```
Open: 11/01/2024
Close: 11/15/2024
```

**Critical:** Applications must be submitted by 11:59 PM Eastern on the closing date. Don't wait until the last day—technical issues happen.

**Application limits:** Some announcements have application caps:
- "This announcement will close at 200 applications OR the closing date, whichever comes first"

Apply early if there's a cap.

### Appointment Type
```
Permanent - Full-Time
```

**Types you'll see:**
- **Permanent** – Ongoing position with full benefits
- **Term** – Limited to specific duration (usually 1-4 years)
- **Temporary** – Usually less than 1 year, often seasonal
- **Intermittent** – As needed (unpredictable hours)

Aim for permanent unless you have a strategic reason for term/temporary.

## Section 2: Who May Apply (CRITICAL)

This section determines whether you can even apply. Read it carefully.

### Open to the Public
```
"This position is open to all U.S. citizens."
```
Anyone can apply. Veterans preference applies here.

### Merit Promotion
```
"Open to current federal employees and other merit promotion eligible applicants."
```

This is an internal announcement. Who qualifies?
- Current federal employees
- **VEOA eligibles** (veterans with 3+ years active duty or preference eligibles)
- **30% or more disabled veterans**
- Former federal employees with reinstatement eligibility
- Some others (military spouses, etc.)

**Key for veterans:** If you're VEOA eligible, you can apply to many merit promotion announcements even as an external candidate.

### Specific Hiring Authorities
```
"This position is open to: Veterans eligible under the Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) authority"
```

Some announcements are specifically for veterans using particular authorities.

### Agency-Only
```
"Open only to current employees of the Department of Defense."
```

You must already work there. Veterans without current federal employment generally cannot apply.

### Understanding "Who May Apply" Codes

USAJOBS uses standard eligibility categories. Common ones include:

| Code | Who It Covers |
|------|---------------|
| **US Citizens** | Any U.S. citizen |
| **Merit Promotion** | Current/former federal employees, VEOA |
| **Federal employees** | Current permanent federal employees |
| **Veterans** | VRA, 30% disabled, VEOA, Schedule A |
| **Military spouses** | Under Executive Order 13473 |
| **Individuals with disabilities** | Schedule A eligible |

**Pro tip:** If you're not sure whether you qualify, check all your eligibilities and claim them when applying. The system will tell you if you don't qualify.

## Section 3: Duties

This section describes what you'll do day-to-day. It helps you:
1. Decide if you actually want the job
2. Identify which of your experiences are relevant
3. Tailor your resume to emphasize matching experience

### Reading Between the Lines

**"May include some travel"** = Occasional travel
**"Travel may be required up to 25% of the time"** = Significant travel
**"Travel up to 50% or more"** = Heavy travel

**"Work schedule may include nights and weekends"** = Regular schedule varies
**"May require shift work"** = Rotating shifts

**"Serves as a liaison"** = Lots of coordination and meetings
**"Conducts analysis"** = Data and report-heavy
**"Oversees programs"** = Management responsibility

## Section 4: Requirements

This is where applications succeed or fail. The requirements section tells you exactly what you need to qualify.

### Qualifications

#### Specialized Experience
The most important requirement. Usually reads:

```
"Specialized Experience: One year of specialized experience equivalent to the
GS-11 grade level in the federal service that includes: (1) conducting analysis
of organizational programs; (2) preparing reports and presentations for senior
leadership; (3) coordinating with multiple stakeholders to accomplish
organizational objectives."
```

**How to interpret:**
- **"One year"** – You need 52 weeks (not necessarily consecutive) of this experience
- **"Equivalent to GS-11"** – Could be federal GS-11, military equivalent, or private sector equivalent
- **Each numbered item** – You must have experience in ALL listed areas

**Common mistake:** Thinking you only need experience in SOME of the areas. You typically need ALL.

#### Education Substitution
Some positions allow education instead of experience:

```
"Education: Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree OR 3 full years of
progressively higher-level graduate education leading to such a degree..."
```

This can help if your experience is light but education is strong.

#### Combination
```
"A combination of education and experience may be used to qualify..."
```

Example: 6 months of specialized experience + 1 year of relevant graduate education = qualification.

### Time-in-Grade (for federal employees)

```
"Time-in-Grade: Applicants must have 52 weeks at the GS-11 grade level."
```

This only applies to current federal employees applying through merit promotion. External applicants (including veterans using special authorities) typically aren't held to time-in-grade.

### Conditions of Employment

These are requirements you must meet after selection:

```
Conditions of Employment:
- Must be a U.S. citizen
- Must be able to obtain and maintain a Secret security clearance
- Subject to pre-employment drug testing
- Must pass a physical examination
- Males born after December 31, 1959 must be registered with Selective Service
```

**Security clearance:** If you currently hold a clearance, mention it prominently. If the position requires a clearance you don't have, understand the investigation takes 6-18 months.

**Drug testing:** Federal positions with security requirements are drug-free. This includes marijuana even in states where it's legal.

**Physical requirements:** Usually for law enforcement, trades, or positions with fieldwork.

### Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs)

Some announcements list KSAs:

```
Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:
1. Knowledge of federal regulations and policies
2. Skill in analyzing complex problems
3. Ability to communicate orally and in writing
4. Ability to plan and organize work
```

Even if not separately required, address these in your resume and questionnaire responses.

## Section 5: Evaluation

This section explains how your application will be assessed.

### Category Rating

```
"Applicants will be evaluated based on qualifications and placed into one
of three categories: Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified."
```

Under category rating:
1. Applications are reviewed against criteria
2. Placed into quality categories
3. Within each category, veterans float to the top
4. Hiring manager selects from top category

### Competitive Rating

```
"Applicants will receive a numerical score based on..."
```

Under competitive rating:
1. Applications receive numerical scores (typically 70-100)
2. Veterans preference points are added (5 or 10)
3. Applicants ranked by total score

### What They're Looking For

```
"You will be evaluated based on your responses to the assessment questionnaire
and the information in your resume."
```

**Translation:**
1. Your questionnaire score determines initial ranking
2. Your resume is used to verify questionnaire answers
3. Mismatch between questionnaire claims and resume = disqualification

## Section 6: How to Apply

### Application Instructions

```
"To apply for this position, you must complete the online application and
submit the documentation specified in the Required Documents section."
```

Follow these exactly. Missing documents = automatic rejection.

### Required Documents

```
Required Documents:
- Resume
- DD-214 (Member Copy 4)
- SF-15 (if claiming 10-point preference)
- VA letter (if claiming disability preference)
- Transcripts (if using education to qualify)
```

**Upload all relevant documents.** Even if you're not sure they're required, include them. More documentation is better than less.

### Application Deadline

```
"All applications must be received by 11:59 PM EST on 11/15/2024"
```

Submit at least 24 hours early. System crashes happen near deadlines.

## Red Flags and Green Flags

### Green Flags (Apply!)
- ✅ "Open to all U.S. citizens" with veterans preference applied
- ✅ Your experience clearly matches specialized experience requirements
- ✅ Multiple vacancies
- ✅ "Direct hire authority" (faster process)
- ✅ Agency where your MOS/rating is valued
- ✅ Career ladder position (GS-9/11/12 = guaranteed promotions)

### Yellow Flags (Investigate Further)
- ⚠️ Very short application window (2-3 days)
- ⚠️ "May be filled at lower grade" (position may be downgraded)
- ⚠️ "Temporary appointment not to exceed 1 year"
- ⚠️ Requirement for certification you don't have
- ⚠️ Very specific experience requirements

### Red Flags (Proceed with Caution)
- ❌ "Current employees only" when you're external
- ❌ Specialized experience you clearly don't have
- ❌ Required credentials you can't obtain quickly (licenses, etc.)
- ❌ Security clearance you don't have for positions needing immediate start
- ❌ Numerous "highly desirable" qualifications you lack

## Decoding Common Phrases

### "Knowledge, skill, or ability preferred but not required"
This is truly optional. You can qualify without it.

### "Must have" vs "Should have"
"Must have" = required
"Should have" = strongly preferred but not absolute requirement

### "Equivalent experience"
Military or private sector experience at a comparable level counts.

### "Demonstrated ability"
Your resume must show concrete examples, not just claim the ability.

### "Expert-level proficiency"
Highest level. You should have trained others or led programs in this area.

### "Journey-level"
Fully competent. Can work independently without close supervision.

### "Entry-level"
Learning the job. Will receive training and close supervision.

### "May be required to work overtime"
Overtime is possible but not constant.

### "Overtime is common"
Expect regular overtime.

## Real Announcement Analysis

Let's analyze a real-type announcement:

```

Indianapolis, IN
$70,685 - $110,803 per year

WHO MAY APPLY: Open to all U.S. citizens. Veterans preference applies.

DUTIES: Serves as a Management Analyst responsible for evaluating
organizational programs and making recommendations for improvement.

```

### Analysis:

**Who should apply:**
- Any U.S. citizen with relevant experience
- E-6/E-7 with staff experience = competitive for GS-11
- E-7/E-8 or O-3+ with significant staff experience = competitive for GS-12

**Keyword targets for resume:**
- "analyzing organizational programs" → operations analysis, mission analysis
- "preparing written reports" → briefings, SOPs, operation orders
- "coordinating with stakeholders" → liaison duties, working groups
- "leading cross-functional teams" → project leadership, working groups

**Application strategy:**
- Apply for highest grade you qualify for
- If unsure, apply for GS-11 (you can negotiate higher if selected)
- Address each specialized experience element specifically in resume
- Application cap at 150 = apply immediately

## Quick Reference: Questions to Ask About Every Announcement

Before applying, answer these questions:

1. **Am I eligible?** (Check "Who May Apply")
2. **Do I meet the specialized experience?** (All elements required)
3. **Do I have required conditions?** (Clearance, education, certifications)
4. **Is the location acceptable?** (Including relocation if required)
5. **Is the appointment type acceptable?** (Permanent vs. temporary)
6. **Can I tailor my resume to match?** (Keywords, requirements)
7. **Is there a deadline or application cap?** (Apply early)

If you answer "no" to questions 1-3, don't apply—you won't qualify.

## The Bottom Line

Federal job announcements contain everything you need to know—if you can decode them.

**Key takeaways:**
- **"Who May Apply" determines eligibility** – Read it first
- **"Specialized Experience" determines qualification** – Match it exactly
- **Keywords matter** – Mirror the announcement language in your resume
