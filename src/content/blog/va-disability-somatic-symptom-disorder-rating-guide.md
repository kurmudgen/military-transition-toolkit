# VA Disability Rating for Somatic Symptom Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Somatic Symptom Disorder is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9422** with ratings from **0% to 100%** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. This condition involves distressing physical symptoms combined with excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to those symptoms. Most veterans receive **30-50%** depending on functional impairment. The challenge is proving the condition began during or was aggravated by service. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Somatic Symptom Disorder?

Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) is characterized by one or more physical symptoms causing significant distress, accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to those symptoms.

**Key features:**
- Distressing somatic (physical) symptoms
- Excessive thoughts about the seriousness of symptoms
- Persistent high anxiety about health
- Excessive time/energy devoted to symptoms
- Symptoms present for 6+ months

**This is NOT "faking"** - the distress and impairment are real, even if medical tests don't explain the severity of symptoms.

**Related conditions:**
- Illness Anxiety Disorder (hypochondriasis)
- Conversion Disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder)
- Pain Disorder

**Military connections:**
- Chronic unexplained symptoms after deployment
- Gulf War Syndrome overlap
- Trauma-related somatic symptoms
- Stress manifesting as physical symptoms
- Medical uncertainty during/after service

| **10%** | Mild symptoms during stress OR controlled by medication |
| **30%** | Occasional decrease in work efficiency, symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment |
