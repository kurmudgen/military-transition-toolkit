# Military Spouse to Teacher: Licensing Across States

## Bottom Line Up Front

Teaching offers military spouses **$45,000-$75,000 salaries** and jobs at every duty station—but licensure headaches have historically derailed careers. Good news: as of 2024, **48 states** have enacted laws to expedite teacher licensure for military spouses. Many states now offer **30-day license processing** or **automatic reciprocity**. Online teaching and DODea schools provide additional PCS-proof options. Your teaching career no longer has to restart every move.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Teaching should be the perfect military spouse career: high demand, good salary, family-friendly schedule, jobs everywhere. But the licensing maze has caused countless military spouse teachers to give up:

- 50 different state licensing systems
- Different tests, coursework requirements, fees
- 6-12 month processing times
- Provisional licenses that limit positions
- Starting over as a "new teacher" each move

The policy landscape has shifted dramatically. Here's what's actually possible now.

## State-by-State Licensure Landscape (2024-2025)

## Success Stories

**Marissa, Marine Corps Spouse - Online Teacher**
"I was licensed in California and dreaded our move to North Carolina—I'd heard horror stories about license transfers. The new interstate compact meant my California license was recognized. Processing took 45 days instead of the 8 months my friend experienced two years ago. I'm teaching fifth grade math and actually like the school better than my California one."

**David, Army Spouse - DODEA Teacher**
"After three PCS moves where I couldn't get licensed in time to teach full-time, I applied to DODEA. Yes, the application took nine months. But now I've taught at schools in Germany, Korea, and Italy. Same employer, same benefits, same retirement. When we PCS, I just request a transfer. It's not perfect, but it's stable."

**Jasmine, Air Force Spouse - Virtual School Teacher**
"I teach Georgia Virtual Academy while living in Texas. My students are in Georgia, my license is Georgia, but I'm physically in San Antonio. When we PCS to Hawaii next year, I'll keep teaching the same students. The time zone will be interesting—I'll teach from 5am-noon Hawaii time—but I'll have the same job, same students, same salary."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "My license expired while I was waiting for the new state to process it"
**Solution:** Most states allow military spouses to renew expired licenses without penalty. New interstate compact includes provisions for license renewal across states. Contact both the old and new state boards—advocacy matters.

### "The new state requires tests I already passed"
**Solution:** Many states now accept Praxis scores indefinitely. The interstate compact explicitly prevents requiring new tests. Push back on this—have the SLO advocate if needed.

### "I can only get a provisional/emergency license"
**Solution:** Provisional licenses let you work while completing requirements. Use this time to build relationships—many principals advocate to keep good teachers. Take required courses online during the school year.

### "I'll lose seniority and start at the bottom of the pay scale"
**Solution:** Many districts now give credit for out-of-state experience. Ask during interview—this is negotiable. DODEA guarantees experience credit. Some states (Virginia, Florida) mandate experience recognition by law.

### "There are no teaching jobs mid-year when we PCS"
**Solution:** Substitute teaching provides income and networking. Long-term sub positions often convert to permanent. Online teaching doesn't follow school year calendars. Private schools hire year-round.

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Research Your Situation
- **Week 1:** Check your current license status (active? expiration?). Research destination state's military spouse licensure policies.
- **Week 2:** Contact destination state board of education. Ask specifically about military spouse expedited processing.
- **Week 3:** Identify required documents (transcripts, test scores, background check). Begin gathering paperwork.
- **Week 4:** Apply for license in new state OR apply for DODEA positions OR research online teaching options.

### Days 31-60: Active Job Search
- **Week 5-6:** Create/update teaching resume (highlight diversity of experience, not gaps). Contact school districts in destination area.
- **Week 7-8:** Apply to 10-20 positions. Network through installation SLO. Consider substitute positions if timing is difficult.

### Days 61-90: Position Security
- **Week 9-10:** Interview for positions. Follow up on license application status.
- **Week 11-12:** Accept position OR develop backup plan (substitute, tutoring, online teaching). Connect with teacher communities at new location.
