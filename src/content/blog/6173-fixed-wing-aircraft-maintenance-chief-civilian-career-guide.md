- **Advantage:** Guaranteed eligibility to test, structured curriculum, often includes job placement assistance

Most 6173s don't need this route—your military experience qualifies you via the documentation pathway.

### Inspection Authorization (IA) - Your next critical credential

After obtaining 3 years of A&P experience (your military time may count), pursue your IA:

**What it is:** Advanced certification allowing you to:
- Perform and approve annual inspections
- Approve major repairs and alterations
- Sign off on airworthiness

**Why it matters:** Required or strongly preferred for Director of Maintenance positions at Part 135 operators and corporate flight departments.

**How to get it:**
- Hold A&P for 3+ years
- Be actively engaged in maintenance
- Pass written exam covering FARs and maintenance regulations
- Cost: $100 exam fee
- Study: 40-80 hours using FAA materials and IA prep courses

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest about civilian aviation differences:

**FAA regulations vs. NAVAIR:** You know NAVAIR technical directives and military technical manuals. Civilian aviation follows FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations)—Part 91 (general aviation), Part 121 (airlines), Part 135 (charter), Part 145 (repair stations). Different structure, same compliance mindset. Your A&P study covers this comprehensively.

**Business and P&L responsibility:** Civilian operations focus heavily on cost control, financial performance, and profitability. You'll need business acumen—budgeting, cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, financial reporting. Consider business courses or MBA.

**Customer service orientation:** Military aviation focuses on mission. Civilian aviation balances safety, customer satisfaction, on-time performance, and profitability. You'll communicate with passengers, executives, and clients—diplomacy and service mindset matter.

**Union labor relations:** Airlines and many MRO facilities are heavily unionized (IAM, TWU). You'll work within collective bargaining agreements, manage union grievances, and navigate labor relations. Different from military command authority.

**Computer systems:** Civilian maintenance uses sophisticated computerized systems—CAMP, Trax, Ultramain, SAP, proprietary airline systems. You'll adapt quickly—these are user-friendly databases for tracking maintenance, parts, and compliance.

**Marketing and customer relations:** Some roles (corporate aviation, MRO sales, charter operations) require client-facing skills, business development, and relationship management. Not purely technical—interpersonal and business skills.
