## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 35G Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analysts transitioning out—you're entering one of the fastest-growing intelligence fields. Your **imagery analysis expertise, geospatial intelligence production, satellite and drone imagery interpretation, terrain analysis, GIS proficiency, and ability to extract intelligence from visual data** make you highly sought after by both government agencies and private sector companies. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$80,000-$100,000** with federal agencies like NGA or entry-level contractor positions, scaling to **$110,000-$150,000** with mid-career positions at defense contractors or commercial satellite companies, and **$150,000-$180,000+** for senior GEOINT positions or specialized technical roles. Your TS/SCI clearance adds **$20,000-$35,000** in salary premium.

The geospatial intelligence market is exploding. Commercial satellite companies (Maxar, Planet Labs, BlackSky) are launching hundreds of satellites. Tech companies need geospatial analysts. Defense contractors can't hire 35Gs fast enough. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) actively recruits former 35Gs. Climate analysis, disaster response, urban planning, agriculture, and autonomous vehicles all need GEOINT expertise. You have options—and they pay well.

As a 35G, you didn't just "look at pictures." You conducted imagery intelligence (IMINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) analysis from satellites, drones, and aircraft. You identified military installations, enemy activity, terrain features, and infrastructure changes. You produced intelligence products integrating imagery with other sources. You mastered specialized software (RemoteView, SOCET GXP, ArcGIS). You briefed commanders on enemy positions and terrain impacts on operations. That's technical expertise, spatial analysis, pattern recognition, and geospatial data science—all highly marketable civilian skills.

The key advantage: GEOINT is both government AND commercial. Unlike other intelligence fields dominated by government work, 35Gs can choose federal agencies, defense contractors, OR commercial companies (Maxar, Google Earth, Planet Labs, Esri) with diverse missions. Your skills translate to disaster response, environmental monitoring, urban planning, infrastructure analysis, agriculture, energy, and more.

## What Does a 35G Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analyst Do?

As a 35G, you conducted imagery and geospatial analysis using satellite imagery, aerial photography, and full-motion video to identify and assess threats, terrain, and infrastructure. You performed imagery interpretation, photogrammetry, terrain analysis, and change detection. You operated specialized GEOINT systems and software including RemoteView, SOCET GXP, Google Earth, ArcGIS, and other geospatial tools. You created intelligence products such as Imagery Intelligence Reports (IIRs), geospatial intelligence products, target materials, and terrain studies.

Your work involved analyzing multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, identifying military equipment and facilities, conducting battle damage assessment (BDA), mapping enemy positions, assessing terrain for route planning, and supporting targeting operations. You integrated GEOINT with other intelligence disciplines (HUMINT, SIGINT) to provide comprehensive intelligence assessments. You maintained imagery libraries and databases, collaborated with other intelligence analysts, and briefed commanders on terrain and enemy analysis.

This role required strong visual analysis skills, attention to detail, spatial reasoning, technical proficiency with geospatial software, understanding of geography and terrain, and security clearance to handle sensitive imagery. You developed expertise in satellite imagery interpretation, change detection, geospatial analysis methodologies, intelligence production, and tactical terrain analysis.

- **Active TS/SCI clearance** (mandatory)
- **GEOINT Professional Certification (GPC)** (NGA offers this—valuable for career progression)
- **Polygraph** (required for most NGA positions)

**Reality check:**
NGA has two main campuses: Springfield, Virginia (DC area) and St. Louis, Missouri. Most imagery analyst positions are at these locations. The hiring process takes 12-18 months including background investigation and polygraph. NGA doesn't use the General Schedule (GS) pay scale—they use their own GG system with pay bands instead of step increases.

The mission is identical to what you did in the military—supporting warfighters and national security—but with better work-life balance, higher pay than military, excellent federal benefits, and no deployments (though OCONUS assignments are possible).

NGA actively recruits military GEOINT professionals. Your 35G experience makes you highly competitive. Apply 18+ months before separation.

**Best for:** 35G analysts who want to continue GEOINT mission, prefer government stability, and want federal benefits with clear career progression.

### Defense Contractor GEOINT Positions (highest near-term pay, fastest hiring)

**Reality check:**
Commercial GEOINT is different from military/government work. Instead of analyzing enemy forces, you're monitoring agriculture, tracking ships for maritime commerce, assessing disaster damage, monitoring construction projects, analyzing environmental changes, or supporting commercial clients.

The missions are diverse: helping insurance companies assess risk, supporting agriculture companies with crop monitoring, tracking deforestation for environmental groups, monitoring global supply chains for corporations, or providing data for autonomous vehicles.

Many positions don't require security clearances, which means more geographic flexibility (San Francisco, Denver, New York, not just DC). The work-life balance is typically better than government/contractor roles. Companies often offer stock options and bonuses.

The downside: less "national security mission" and you may need to learn commercial/business applications of GEOINT. Salaries are competitive but may start slightly lower than cleared defense positions.

**Best for:** 35G analysts interested in commercial applications of GEOINT, want to live outside DC area, prefer private sector culture, and are excited about cutting-edge satellite technology.
