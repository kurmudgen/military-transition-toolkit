## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 15Q Air Traffic Controllers have **the most direct civilian pathway of any MOS**, with FAA immediately recognizing military ATC experience and issuing equivalent certifications. Your radar operations, traffic sequencing, separation standards, and emergency procedures transfer directly to FAA positions earning **$65,000-$140,000+ annually**. Entry-level controllers start at **GS-7 ($48K-$62K)**, promote to **GS-9 ($58K-$75K)**, reach **GS-11 ($72K-$95K)** within 5-7 years, and senior controllers/supervisors earn **$100,000-$140,000+**. No additional training required beyond FAA certification. Veterans receive hiring preference and FAA actively recruits from military ATC ranks. The U.S. faces critical controller shortage - your military experience is in extreme demand.

## Why 15Q Controllers Excel at FAA Positions

The FAA doesn't just accept military ATC experience - **they prefer hiring military controllers** because you've operated under real-world conditions with actual life-or-death consequences.

You didn't just watch radar screens. You:
- Separated multiple aircraft simultaneously under high stress
- Made split-second decisions affecting safety
- Followed strict separation standards and procedures
- Communicated clearly in crisis situations
- Operated complex radar and navigation systems
- Worked rotating shifts and night operations
- Maintained composure during emergencies
- Documented all actions accurately
- Followed strict regulatory compliance
- Demonstrated exceptional concentration and attention

That's not "just military," that's **FAA foundation**. The FAA knows military controllers bring maturity, discipline, and operational experience that takes civilian controllers years to develop.

**Reality check:**
FAA has streamlined hiring for military controllers. Process: Apply through USAJobs, pass FAA medical exam, receive controller certificate (issued within 30-60 days), hire at GS-7, complete facility checkout (12-24 months), promote to GS-11 after certification.

Military experience counts for GS-7 entry instead of lower grades. Your 15Q background provides "equivalent experience" to civilian controllers with years of training.

Facility checkout varies by complexity: Low-traffic facilities 12 months, medium facilities 18 months, high-traffic facilities 24+ months.

Starting at GS-7: $50K-$65K base salary. With premium pay (midnight shift, Sunday premium) and overtime, first-year income $65K-$80K realistic.

Controllers at major facilities earn significantly more: Newark TRACON $95K-$120K+, New York TRACON $100K-$130K+, Los Angeles TRACON $95K-$120K+.

Within 5-7 years at busy facility: GS-11 controller making $80K-$100K base + overtime ($100K-$125K total).

Within 10-15 years: Supervisory positions, facility management, $100K-$140K+.

**Best for:** 15Q veterans wanting direct civilian ATC position with immediate GS-7 hire.

### Position 2: Tower Controller (Tower Cab)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1:** Medical disqualification. FAA medical exams are rigorous. Significant vision problems, hearing loss, or medical conditions can disqualify. Get medical exam FIRST before investing time.

**Mistake #2:** Applying to only one facility. Hire is competitive. Apply to 5-10+ facilities nationwide to maximize options and timeline.

**Mistake #3:** Not researching facility traffic volume. Start at moderate-traffic facility for better checkout experience and job security. Don't start at mega-facilities unless you have significant confidence.

**Mistake #4:** Ignoring cost of living in major facilities. NYC and LA controllers earn more but cost of living is high. Consider mid-size cities offering better work-life balance.

**Mistake #5:** Not understanding shift work commitment. Controllers work rotating shifts, nights, weekends, holidays. 24-hour operations requirement means schedule varies. Must be comfortable with this.
