# Best Cities in Texas for Veterans 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Austin ranks **#1 nationally** for veterans (WalletHub 2025)—offering the best colleges, 10th highest veteran median income ($62,000), 7th best job growth, and extensive military discounts, but housing is expensive at $499,000 median. San Antonio takes **#2 for Texas veterans**—massive military presence (80,000 at Joint Base San Antonio), strong veteran community (110,000+ veterans), affordable housing ($335,000 median), and excellent quality of life.

For employment, Dallas (#25 nationally) offers the most jobs with median home prices at $439,999. For affordability, El Paso, Corpus Christi, and Lubbock offer median homes under $250,000 while maintaining good veteran services and low cost of living.

Texas's unique advantage: **no state income tax** saves military retirees $2,000-$6,000 annually, and 100% disabled veterans get **full property tax exemptions** worth $5,000-$12,000+ annually depending on location. A 100% disabled veteran with $50,000 military retirement saves $10,000-$15,000 annually in combined tax benefits, substantially offsetting Texas's higher property tax rates.

Overall, Texas cities excel for job opportunities, military culture, and tax benefits, but housing costs vary dramatically—Austin and Dallas are expensive ($440K-$500K median) while smaller cities offer affordability ($150K-$300K). Best state for veterans prioritizing employment, education (Hazlewood Act), and veteran community.
