# Military to Transportation/Logistics: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Transportation and logistics offer veterans immediate career entry with CDL drivers earning $50,000-$90,000+ and logistics managers earning $70,000-$120,000+. Your military transportation experience translates directly—military vehicle experience often reduces CDL training time. The trucking industry has a severe driver shortage, creating excellent demand and signing bonuses for CDL holders. Logistics management roles leverage your supply chain and operations experience. Most veterans can transition within 1-3 months for driving roles or 3-6 months for management positions.

## Why Veterans Excel in Transportation/Logistics

Military logistics IS civilian logistics. You've moved equipment, personnel, and supplies—often in the most challenging conditions imaginable. This experience exceeds what most civilian candidates offer.

Your experience operating large military vehicles provides CDL foundation. Many states allow military vehicle experience to count toward CDL requirements, reducing or eliminating training needs.

Safety discipline from military driving translates to DOT compliance requirements. You understand pre-trip inspections, maintenance reporting, and safe operations.

Your ability to work independently while maintaining standards fits trucking. Long-haul drivers operate autonomously; your military discipline ensures compliance without direct supervision.

Logistics management skills from military supply chain apply directly. You've coordinated complex movements, managed inventories, and maintained distribution operations.

Security clearances matter for defense logistics positions and sensitive cargo transportation.

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. Not Checking Military CDL Waiver**
Many states waive CDL skills test for military vehicle experience. Check your state's requirements before paying for training.

**2. Choosing Wrong Company**
Research company reputation, home time, pay structure, and equipment. Not all carriers are equal.

**3. Unrealistic Expectations About OTR**
Long-haul trucking means weeks away from home. Ensure lifestyle compatibility.

**4. Ignoring Local/Regional Options**
Local and regional driving offer better home time. Consider these if family time matters.

**5. Not Getting Endorsements**
Hazmat, tanker, and doubles endorsements increase pay significantly. Get them early.

**6. Overlooking Logistics Management**
With your military logistics experience, management roles may be appropriate. Don't limit yourself to driving only.

**7. Not Using VA Benefits for Training**
GI Bill and VR&E may cover CDL training. Investigate before paying out of pocket.
