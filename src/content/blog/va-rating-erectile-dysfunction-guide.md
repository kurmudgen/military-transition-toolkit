# VA Rating for Erectile Dysfunction (ED): SMC-K Compensation (2025)

Erectile dysfunction is one of the most underrated VA disability claims—literally. Many veterans don't know that ED qualifies for compensation, and even those who do often miss out on the Special Monthly Compensation (SMC-K) that comes with it.

Here's the key: ED is rated at 0%, but it qualifies for SMC-K, which adds $131.64 per month to your compensation regardless of your overall rating. And if ED is secondary to a service-connected condition (which it usually is), getting it approved is straightforward.

## How the VA Rates Erectile Dysfunction

### The 0% Rating

ED by itself is rated at 0% under Diagnostic Code 7522 (penis, deformity, with loss of erectile power).

**Why 0%?** The VA considers ED itself a condition that doesn't cause "industrial impairment"—it doesn't directly affect your ability to work.

**But here's the important part**: Even at 0%, ED qualifies for Special Monthly Compensation K (SMC-K) for "loss of use of a creative organ."

### Special Monthly Compensation K (SMC-K)

SMC-K is additional monthly compensation for specific severe disabilities. Loss of erectile function qualifies.

**2025 SMC-K Rate: $131.64/month**

This is added ON TOP of your regular compensation. If you're rated at 70% ($1,716.28/month) and have SMC-K for ED, your total is $1,847.92/month.

**Annual value of SMC-K: $1,579.68/year**

Over 20 years, that's $31,593.60 in additional compensation most veterans don't know they can claim.

### What You Get

- **0% rating** for erectile dysfunction
- **SMC-K** adding $131.64/month
- Access to VA treatment for ED (medications, devices)
- Documentation for future claims

## Why ED Is Usually a Secondary Claim

ED is rarely directly caused by military service. Instead, it's almost always secondary to another service-connected condition.

### Most Common Connections

**PTSD → ED**
- Anxiety and stress affect sexual function
- PTSD medications (SSRIs) commonly cause ED
- Hypervigilance interferes with relaxation needed for erection
- One of the strongest secondary connections

**Diabetes → ED**
- Diabetes damages blood vessels and nerves
- Very common in diabetic men (up to 75%)
- Clear medical connection

**Hypertension → ED**
- High blood pressure damages blood vessels
- BP medications frequently cause ED as side effect
- Beta blockers, diuretics especially

**Sleep Apnea → ED**
- Oxygen deprivation affects function
- Sleep disruption affects hormones
- Well-documented connection

**Medications for Service-Connected Conditions → ED**
- SSRIs and SNRIs (depression, anxiety, PTSD)
- Blood pressure medications
- Pain medications
- Prostate medications

**Prostate Conditions → ED**
- Prostate surgery
- Prostatitis
- BPH treatments

**Back/Spinal Cord Conditions → ED**
- Nerve damage from spine injuries
- Lumbar radiculopathy

**Traumatic Brain Injury → ED**
- Hormonal disruption
- Neurological effects

### Filing Secondary ED Claims

If you're service-connected for ANY of these conditions and have ED:

1. File ED as secondary to that condition
2. Provide current diagnosis of ED
3. Get nexus letter (or let C&P examiner provide opinion)
4. Receive 0% rating + SMC-K

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Diagnosis of erectile dysfunction** from doctor
2. **Treatment records** showing:
   - Prescriptions for ED medication (Viagra, Cialis, etc.)
   - Urology consultations
   - Any devices prescribed

3. **Documentation of primary condition** (PTSD, diabetes, etc.)

### Connection Evidence

4. **For medication-caused ED:**
   - List of medications for service-connected conditions
   - Medical literature showing ED as side effect

5. **For condition-caused ED:**
   - Nexus letter explaining connection
   - Medical literature supporting link

### Lay Evidence

6. **Personal statement** describing:
   - When ED began
   - Connection to service-connected condition or medications
   - Impact on quality of life and relationships

7. **Spouse/partner statement** (optional but powerful):
   - Corroborates ED
   - Describes impact on relationship

## C&P Exam for ED

### What to Expect

ED exams are conducted with privacy and professionalism. The examiner will:

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about medical history
3. Ask about ED symptoms and onset
4. Ask about treatments tried
5. **Will NOT require physical demonstration**
6. Provide nexus opinion for secondary claims

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- When did you first notice ED?
- How often does ED occur?
- Have you tried treatment? What?
- What service-connected condition do you think caused it?
- Are you taking medications that might contribute?
- How has ED affected your quality of life?

### How to Answer

**Be straightforward:**
- "I haven't been able to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse for the past 3 years"
- "I started having problems about 6 months after beginning [SSRI medication] for PTSD"
- "Since my diabetes diagnosis, my ED has gotten progressively worse"

**Don't be embarrassed:**
The examiner deals with this routinely. Your answers directly affect your rating. Be honest and complete.

### The Privacy Factor

Many veterans don't file for ED because they're embarrassed. Remember:
- Your claim file is confidential
- Examiners are medical professionals
- This is about compensation you've earned
- It's $1,500+ per year you're leaving on the table

## The Medication Connection

### SSRIs/SNRIs and ED

If you take any of these for PTSD, depression, or anxiety:
- Sertraline (Zoloft)
- Fluoxetine (Prozac)
- Paroxetine (Paxil)
- Citalopram (Celexa)
- Escitalopram (Lexapro)
- Venlafaxine (Effexor)
- Duloxetine (Cymbalta)

**ED is a well-documented side effect.** File ED as secondary to the mental health condition being treated.

### Blood Pressure Medications and ED

Common BP medications causing ED:
- Metoprolol
- Atenolol
- Lisinopril
- Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
- Amlodipine

If you're service-connected for hypertension and taking BP meds, ED may be secondary.

### Pain Medications and ED

Opioids and some pain medications affect testosterone and sexual function. If you're taking these for service-connected conditions, ED may be secondary.

## Common Misconceptions

### "ED isn't a real disability"
ED significantly affects quality of life and relationships. The VA recognizes this with SMC-K.

### "I'm too young for ED"
ED affects veterans of all ages, especially those with PTSD, diabetes, or on certain medications.

### "The VA won't approve this"
ED secondary to PTSD, diabetes, or medications is very commonly approved. It's a straightforward claim.

### "It's too embarrassing"
Your claim is confidential. The $1,500+/year adds up. Don't leave money on the table.

### "0% means no compensation"
0% means no compensation FROM THE RATING—but SMC-K is ADDITIONAL compensation that doesn't depend on your percentage.

## How SMC-K Combines with Your Rating

SMC-K is ADDED to your regular compensation. Examples:

| VA Rating | Base Pay | + SMC-K | Total Monthly |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| 30% | $524.31 | $131.64 | $655.95 |
| 50% | $1,110.55 | $131.64 | $1,242.19 |
| 70% | $1,716.28 | $131.64 | $1,847.92 |
| 100% | $3,906.04 | $131.64 | $4,037.68 |

SMC-K is the same amount regardless of your rating.

## Other SMC-K Qualifying Conditions

ED isn't the only condition that qualifies for SMC-K. Others include:
- Loss of one or both eyes
- Loss of use of one or both feet
- Loss of use of one or both hands
- Deafness in both ears
- Inability to communicate by speech
- **Loss of use of a creative organ** (ED falls here)

You can receive multiple SMC-K awards for multiple qualifying conditions (though there are caps).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to prove ED with tests?
No. Diagnosis based on your reported symptoms and medical history is sufficient. No physical demonstration required.

### Can I claim ED if I'm not in a relationship?
Yes. The condition exists regardless of relationship status.

### What if my ED is partial (sometimes works)?
You can still claim if you have "loss of erectile power"—it doesn't have to be complete inability.

### Will ED medication appear on my VA records?
Yes, if you use VA pharmacy. Your records are confidential under HIPAA.

### Can I get ED treatment through the VA?
Yes. Service connection gives you access to VA treatment including medications (Viagra, Cialis) and devices.

### What if my ED was caused by aging?
If you have a service-connected condition or take medication for service-connected conditions that contribute to ED, you can still claim. The VA doesn't require the condition to be SOLELY caused by service.

### Is there a form specifically for ED?
No special form—use standard VA Form 21-526EZ and claim ED as secondary to your primary condition.

## Step-by-Step: Filing Your ED Claim

### Step 1: Identify Your Primary Condition

What service-connected condition is ED secondary to?
- PTSD/anxiety/depression
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Sleep apnea
- Medications for any service-connected condition

### Step 2: Get Diagnosed

See your doctor (VA or private) and get ED documented in your records. Mention it at your next appointment.

### Step 3: Document the Connection

If ED is from medications, have a list of your medications for service-connected conditions.

If ED is from the condition itself, understand the medical connection (PTSD affects arousal, diabetes damages blood vessels, etc.).

### Step 4: File the Claim

File VA Form 21-526EZ:
- Claim: Erectile dysfunction
- Secondary to: [Your primary condition]

### Step 5: Attend C&P Exam

Answer questions honestly. The exam is private and professional.

### Step 6: Receive Decision

Expect 0% rating + SMC-K award.

## Bottom Line

Erectile dysfunction is a common condition among veterans with PTSD, diabetes, hypertension, and those taking medications for service-connected conditions. Yet many veterans never claim it because they don't know it qualifies for compensation or are embarrassed.

**Key facts:**
- ED is rated 0% but qualifies for SMC-K ($131.64/month)
- Almost always secondary to another condition
- Very straightforward claim with proper documentation
- Confidential—your records are protected

Don't leave $1,500+ per year on the table.
