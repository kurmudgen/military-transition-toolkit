# South Carolina Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

South Carolina operates two full VA medical centers—**Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston** and **William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center in Columbia**—plus nine community-based outpatient clinics across the state (Anderson, Florence, Beaufort, Greenville, Spartanburg, Rock Hill, Sumter, Orangeburg, and Myrtle Beach). Together, these facilities serve over 200,000 enrolled veterans. About 90% of South Carolina veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care.

For education, South Carolina offers exceptional benefits: **free tuition at any state-supported college or university for children of 100% disabled or deceased veterans** (up to age 26)—one of the best state education programs nationally. Major GI Bill schools include University of South Carolina (Yellow Ribbon, 1,500+ student veterans), Clemson University (Yellow Ribbon, 900+ student veterans), and The Citadel (Yellow Ribbon, ranked #1 for veterans among regional universities South). BAH rates range from $1,850-$2,100/month depending on location.

Employment is excellent: South Carolina veterans recorded a **1.7% unemployment rate in 2024**—tied for 7th lowest nationally and significantly below the 3.0% national veteran average. The state offers mandatory veteran hiring preference (every state agency must interview at least one qualified veteran per position posted). Major veteran employers include Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson (3,500 civilian employees), Shaw Air Force Base, Boeing, BAE Systems, and Fidelity Investments.

Overall rating: **8.5/10** for healthcare (two medical centers, excellent geographic coverage), **9/10** for education (outstanding state benefits plus strong GI Bill schools), **9.5/10** for employment (1.7% veteran unemployment, mandatory state hiring preference).

- Urban access (Charleston, Columbia, Greenville): Excellent—direct access to medical centers or major clinics within 20-30 minutes
- Suburban access (Rock Hill, Spartanburg, Anderson, Florence, Beaufort, Myrtle Beach): Very good—outpatient clinics within 30-40 minutes
