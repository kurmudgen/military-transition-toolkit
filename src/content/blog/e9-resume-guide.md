# E9/Master Chief Resume: Commanding Your Civilian Career Transition

## Bottom Line Up Front

You're in the top 1% of enlisted personnel. You advised commanders, shaped organizational culture, influenced decisions affecting hundreds or thousands of people. You're an executive who doesn't realize it yet. **E9s should be targeting $120K-$250K+ positions** in senior leadership, executive roles, consulting, and C-suite equivalent positions. But most E9s undersell themselves massively and end up in roles making $75K-$90K. This guide shows you how to position yourself at the executive level you've already earned.

## You're not a senior manager. You're an executive.

Let's be blunt: You were the senior enlisted advisor to a commanding officer. In civilian terms, that's advising the CEO.

You shaped organizational culture for 200-2,000+ people. You influenced strategic decisions. You were the voice of the workforce to executive leadership. You mentored dozens of leaders. You solved enterprise-level problems that nobody else could touch.

That's C-suite equivalent work.

But your resume probably says something like "Senior enlisted leader with 25 years experience seeking challenging opportunity."

That's the problem.

## The imposter syndrome trap

Here's what happens to most E9s:

You look at civilian executive job postings and think "I don't have a business degree. I don't have an MBA. I've never worked in this industry. They want someone with corporate experience."

So you apply for "manager" or "senior manager" roles making $75K-$95K. You get hired. And you spend the next five years being dramatically underpaid while watching people with half your leadership experience get promoted above you.

Stop.

You have 20-30 years of executive leadership experience. You advised CEOs (COs). You shaped organizations. You've done the work.

The degree gap? You can frame your military education as equivalent leadership development (and it is). The industry gap? Leadership is leadership. The corporate experience gap? You managed complexity that makes most corporate problems look simple.

Position yourself at the level you've already operated at for the past 5-10 years.

## What E9s actually did (translated for civilians)

**What you think your job was:** "Senior enlisted advisor to the CO"

**What your job actually was in civilian terms:** "Chief People Officer and Senior Advisor to CEO. Provided strategic counsel on organizational culture, workforce development, and operational readiness. Led enterprise-wide initiatives affecting 500-1,000+ personnel. Shaped policies impacting retention, performance, and organizational effectiveness."

**What you write:** "Led command morale and welfare programs"

**What you actually did:** "Directed employee engagement and organizational culture initiatives for 800-person organization, increasing retention 18% and achieving #1 ranking in employee satisfaction across 20 peer organizations."

**What you write:** "Advised commanding officer on personnel matters"

**What you actually did:** "Served as strategic advisor to CEO-equivalent on workforce strategy, organizational development, change management, and executive decision-making. Influenced policy affecting $50M+ organization."

See the difference?

## The executive resume format for E9s

Your resume needs to look like an executive resume, not a military resume.

### Executive profile (not "summary")

This is a 5-6 line positioning statement that screams "senior leader":

"Senior Executive Leader with 25 years driving organizational transformation, strategic change, and enterprise-level performance improvement. Proven track record advising C-suite executives, shaping organizational culture for 500-2,000+ person organizations, and leading strategic initiatives delivering measurable results. Expertise in leadership development, change management, organizational culture, and strategic planning. Built and developed dozens of high-performing leaders across complex, mission-critical environments. Recognized thought leader with track record of solving enterprise-level problems and driving sustainable organizational change."

You're not looking for a job. You're positioning your executive brand.

### Executive competencies

Strategic capabilities, not technical skills:

- Executive Advisory & Strategic Counsel
- Organizational Culture & Change Management
- Leadership Development & Succession Planning
- Strategic Planning & Execution
- Enterprise Program Management
- Organizational Development & Design
- Stakeholder Engagement & Communication
- Crisis Leadership & Risk Management
- Workforce Strategy & Talent Management
- Performance Management & Continuous Improvement

These are C-suite competencies. This is your playing field.

### Professional experience

E9 resume bullets need to show three things:
1. Strategic scope
2. Executive-level problem-solving
3. Measurable organizational impact

**Format for E9 roles:**

**Title** (use executive equivalent) **- Organization | Dates**
Context paragraph showing scope and strategic accountability

Then 5-7 bullets showing executive-level impact:

**Senior Enlisted Advisor / Chief People Officer, Naval Command (2,000 personnel) | 2020-2024**
*Senior advisor to Commanding Officer (CEO) on organizational culture, workforce strategy, and enterprise operations. Provided strategic counsel on executive decisions affecting $200M organization. Led cross-functional initiatives spanning multiple departments and geographic locations.*

- **Transformed** organizational culture for 2,000-person enterprise through comprehensive employee engagement strategy, increasing retention 22% and achieving #1 ranking in command climate across 30 peer organizations
- **Advised** executive leadership on strategic decisions, policy formulation, and organizational design, directly influencing $200M+ in operations and resource allocation
- **Architected** leadership development pipeline affecting 150+ leaders at all levels, resulting in 45 promotions (18% above command average) and 94% retention of high-performers
- **Led** enterprise-wide change management initiative during major organizational restructuring, ensuring zero mission impact while integrating 300+ new personnel and standing up 2 new departments
- **Championed** diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy that increased diverse representation in leadership by 35% and won Department-level recognition
- **Directed** crisis response and organizational resilience during 4 major events, providing executive leadership that maintained operations and protected organizational reputation
- **Built** strategic partnerships with community organizations, government agencies, and industry partners, enhancing organizational brand and creating $500K+ in value through resource sharing

Every bullet shows executive-level thinking and enterprise impact.

## Before and after: the full executive transformation

### Before (the resume that gets $75K offers)

**Command Master Chief, USS Something | 2019-2024**
- Served as senior enlisted advisor to commanding officer
- Oversaw morale, welfare, and recreation programs
- Managed enlisted performance evaluation system
- Mentored junior enlisted leaders
- Coordinated command events and ceremonies
- Maintained communication between enlisted personnel and leadership
- Represented command at various events

This gets you middle management roles at $70K-$85K. You're positioned as "senior staff" not "executive."

### After (the resume that gets $150K+ offers)

**Senior Executive Advisor / Chief People Officer, USS Something (800 personnel) | 2019-2024**
*Senior strategic advisor to Commanding Officer on organizational culture, workforce development, and enterprise operations. Provided executive counsel on decisions affecting $180M organization across multiple locations. Led enterprise initiatives driving organizational transformation.*

- **Transformed** organizational culture and employee engagement for 800-person enterprise, implementing data-driven retention strategy that reduced turnover 24% (saving $3.2M in replacement costs) and achieving #1 climate ranking among peer commands
- **Served** as strategic advisor to CEO-equivalent on workforce strategy, policy formulation, organizational design, and change management, influencing decisions affecting $180M annual operations
- **Architected** comprehensive leadership development ecosystem for 100+ emerging leaders, resulting in 35 promotions to supervisory roles (22% above historical average) and 96% retention of identified high-potential personnel
- **Led** enterprise-wide organizational transformation during major restructuring, coordinating change management across 6 departments, integrating 200+ new employees, and maintaining 100% operational readiness throughout transition
- **Championed** diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy that increased underrepresented groups in leadership by 40%, established mentoring programs affecting 150+ employees, and won regional recognition for cultural transformation
- **Directed** enterprise crisis management and organizational resilience during 5 critical incidents, providing executive leadership that protected organizational reputation and maintained stakeholder confidence
- **Built** strategic external partnerships generating $650K+ in community support, enhanced organizational brand awareness, and positioned command as employer of choice in region
- **Drove** continuous improvement initiatives yielding $1.8M in cost savings through process optimization, resource allocation enhancement, and operational efficiency improvements

Now you're positioned for VP, Chief People Officer, or senior consulting roles at $120K-$200K+.

## The jobs you should target

**Chief People Officer / VP of Human Resources** ($130K-$220K)
You were essentially a CPO. You shaped culture, developed talent, drove engagement. This is a natural fit.

**VP of Operations** ($140K-$200K)
If your advisory role included operational oversight (many E9s), you're qualified to lead operations at enterprise level.

**Chief of Staff** ($120K-$180K)
You were the CO's senior advisor. Chief of Staff roles do the same thing for CEOs - strategic counsel, initiative leadership, organizational effectiveness.

**Senior Organizational Development Consultant** ($150K-$250K+)
Your experience transforming organizational culture, developing leaders, and driving change is exactly what OD consultants do. You can command premium rates.

**Executive Coach / Leadership Consultant** ($120-$350/hour)
You've coached dozens of leaders. Executive coaching is a lucrative field for experienced E9s who can articulate their leadership philosophy.

**Senior Program Manager / Program Director** ($115K-$175K)
You led enterprise programs. These roles manage large-scale initiatives across organizations.

**Director of Learning & Development** ($100K-$160K)
You built leadership pipelines and development programs. L&D directors do the same in corporate environments.

**Veteran Affairs Leadership** ($110K-$165K)
VA medical centers, regional offices, and veteran service organizations need senior leaders who understand military culture.

## The consulting path (worth serious consideration)

Many E9s are uniquely positioned for consulting:

**Organizational culture consulting** - Help companies transform culture, improve engagement, reduce turnover. You've done this at scale.

**Leadership development** - Design and deliver leadership programs. You've trained hundreds of leaders.

**Change management** - Guide organizations through restructuring, mergers, technology change. You've led enterprise change.

**Executive coaching** - One-on-one coaching for emerging and established executives. You've mentored leaders for decades.

**Rates:** $150-$350/hour is reasonable for E9-level consultants with proper positioning. That's $200K-$500K+ annually if you can stay busy.

**Getting started:** Build your brand on LinkedIn, get certified (ICF coaching credential, Prosci change management, etc.), start with veteran-owned businesses or defense contractors who know your value, build from there.

## The MBA question

Do you need an MBA for executive roles?

Short answer: It helps, but it's not required.

**When it matters:** Fortune 500 companies, financial services, some consulting firms. They have MBA preferences for senior roles.

**When it doesn't:** Mid-size companies, operations roles, manufacturing, logistics, defense contractors, consulting (experience trumps degree).

**The reality:** Your 25 years of leadership development is equivalent education. But some companies use MBA as a filter.

**Options:**
- **Get one:** Executive MBA programs are designed for experienced leaders. 18-24 months, $40K-$80K. Good ROI if targeting corporate executive roles.
- **Substitute it:** Emphasize your senior-level military leadership courses (Navy Senior Enlisted Academy, etc.) as "executive leadership development programs."
- **Sidestep it:** Target companies that value experience over credentials. Plenty of E9s become VPs without MBAs.

If you're targeting CPO or Chief of Staff roles at Fortune 500 companies, MBA helps. If you're targeting mid-market or consulting, your experience is enough.

## Addressing the "no corporate experience" objection

Here's how to flip it:

**Don't say:** "I don't have corporate experience, but I'm a quick learner."

**Say:** "I've led organizational transformation in complex, high-stakes environments where mission failure has serious consequences. While the context was military, the leadership fundamentals are universal - strategic planning, culture building, change management, developing people. In fact, the complexity and scale I operated at exceeds most corporate environments."

**Then back it up:**
"At my last command, I advised the CEO on workforce strategy for an 800-person organization with $180M annual budget. I led culture transformation initiatives, built leadership pipelines, managed change across multiple departments. The challenges - retention, engagement, performance management, succession planning - are identical to corporate HR/OD work. The scale is often larger than most companies you'll work with."

**Your "lack of corporate experience" is actually an asset** - you bring fresh perspective and you've solved problems at scale that many corporate leaders never face.

## Translating command selection and awards

**Command Master Chief / Command Senior Enlisted Leader selection:**
"Competitively selected (top 1% of eligible candidates) for senior executive advisory role to CEO of 800-person organization. Selection based on demonstrated leadership excellence, strategic thinking, and organizational impact."

This matters. Most civilians don't understand how selective these positions are. Frame it.

**Major awards:**
- **SEAL/SECNAV Level Awards:** "Received Department-level recognition for organizational transformation initiatives"
- **Fleet/Force Level:** "Awarded regional-level excellence recognition for leadership"
- **Joint Meritorious Service Medal:** "Received joint service recognition for strategic contributions"

Don't list every award. Highlight the strategic-level ones that show enterprise recognition.

## The LinkedIn executive presence

Your LinkedIn profile is critical at the E9 level.

**Headline:**
Not "Retired Command Master Chief"
Try: "Senior Executive Leader | Organizational Transformation | Leadership Development | Change Management"

**Summary:**
Write 3-4 paragraphs positioning yourself as an executive, not a retiree. Tell your leadership story. What problems do you solve? What impact do you create? What do you bring to organizations?

**Experience:**
Same format as your resume - executive titles, strategic scope, measurable impact.

**Recommendations:**
Get them from COs, senior officers, peer E9s. LinkedIn recommendations from O-6+ leaders carry weight.

**Activity:**
Post occasionally about leadership, share articles on organizational culture, comment on content from target companies. Be visible. Executives notice executives who are engaged.

**Network:**
Connect with VPs, CHROs, Chiefs of Staff, CEO coaches. Not just recruiters - connect with people in the roles you want.

## The executive interview is different

E9s get asked different questions than E7s or E8s:

**"How would you describe your leadership philosophy?"**
Have a clear, articulate answer. This is an executive question. They want to see if you can think and speak strategically about leadership.

Good answer: "I believe leadership is about three things: developing people to their highest potential, creating culture where high performance is the standard, and serving as the strategic voice of the workforce to executive decision-makers. Throughout my career, I've focused on building leadership capacity at all levels while ensuring the workforce perspective informs strategic decisions."

**"Tell me about a time you influenced executive decision-making."**
They want to know you can operate at the senior table. Have 2-3 stories ready about advising the CO on strategic decisions.

**"How do you approach organizational culture change?"**
This is your wheelhouse. Walk them through your framework: assess current state, define desired state, engage stakeholders, build coalition, implement with clear metrics, sustain through systems and leadership.

**"What's your experience with diversity and inclusion?"**
Have a thoughtful answer. If you led D&I initiatives, talk specifics. If not, talk about how you built diverse teams and created inclusive environments.

**"Why should we hire you over candidates with corporate experience?"**
"I bring something corporate candidates often lack - experience leading at scale in high-stakes, complex environments where mission failure has serious consequences. I've advised senior executives, transformed organizational culture for 500+ person organizations, and led enterprise change. The context was military, but the leadership challenges - retention, engagement, change management, building high-performing teams - are universal. I bring proven executive leadership without corporate baggage or industry blind spots."

## Salary negotiation at executive level

E9s consistently undersell themselves. Here's reality:

**Your experience level is worth:** $120K-$200K+ in most markets
**What E9s often accept:** $75K-$95K because they don't know their value

**How to negotiate:**

1. **Research market rates** for VP, Director, Chief People Officer roles in your area. Use Glassdoor, Salary.com, LinkedIn Salary.

2. **Don't discuss salary until they make an offer.** If pressed early, give a range: "Based on my research for executive roles at this level, I'm targeting $140-$160K, but I'm open to discussing total compensation."

3. **Negotiate everything:** Base salary, bonus/incentive pay, 401k match, PTO (you're used to 30 days - don't accept 10), flexible work, professional development budget, title.

4. **Know your walk-away number.** If they offer $80K for an executive role, they're not valuing you appropriately. Be willing to decline.

5. **Get it in writing.** Executive offers should be formal offer letters. Review before signing.

**Don't accept the first offer.** Companies expect executive candidates to negotiate. If you don't, it signals lack of confidence.

## Common mistakes E9s make

**Mistake 1: Positioning as "senior enlisted" not "executive"**
Using military titles and talking about your role as "senior enlisted" makes civilians think "HR person" not "executive leader."

Fix: Position as strategic advisor, chief people officer, senior executive leader.

**Mistake 2: Targeting manager roles**
Manager roles are 2-3 levels below where you should be.

Fix: Target Director, VP, C-suite, senior consultant roles.

**Mistake 3: Underselling advisory impact**
"Advised the CO" sounds like you gave opinions. You shaped strategic decisions.

Fix: "Provided strategic counsel to CEO on organizational strategy, influencing decisions affecting $200M enterprise"

**Mistake 4: Not quantifying culture/people impact**
"Improved morale" is vague. Numbers matter.

Fix: "Increased retention 22%, improved engagement scores from 3.1 to 4.4/5.0, achieved #1 climate ranking among peer organizations"

**Mistake 5: Accepting lowball offers**
"I'm just happy someone wants to hire me" is not an executive mindset.

Fix: Know your market value. Negotiate accordingly. Walk away from insulting offers.

## The executive certification question

Certifications that matter at E9 level:

**International Coach Federation (ICF) Credential** - If pursuing executive coaching. ACC or PCC level. Cost: $2K-$5K. Opens doors to coaching work.

**Prosci Change Management Certification** - Shows you can lead organizational change using recognized methodology. Cost: $2,500-$3,500. Valued in consulting.

**SHRM-SCP (Senior Certified Professional)** - For CPO/senior HR roles. Shows you understand HR at strategic level. Cost: $800-$1,200.

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - Still valuable for program management roles. Cost: $800-$1,200.

You don't need all of these. Pick 1-2 based on your target path. ICF and Prosci are probably the highest ROI for E9s.

## The board member opportunity

E9s are qualified for nonprofit and corporate board positions. This is often overlooked.

**Why you're qualified:** Board members provide strategic oversight, governance, and counsel to executive teams. That's what you did as a senior advisor.

**Where to start:**
- **Veteran nonprofit boards:** Many veteran service organizations need board members who understand military culture
- **Community nonprofit boards:** Local organizations often seek experienced leaders for board service
- **Corporate boards:** Harder to access but possible, especially with veteran-focused companies

**Value:** Board positions pay $5K-$50K+ annually depending on organization size. More importantly, they position you as an executive peer and expand your network.

## Speaking and thought leadership

E9s have valuable insights on leadership, organizational culture, and change management.

**Speaking opportunities:**
- Military transition conferences
- Veteran organizations
- Leadership development events
- Corporate training programs
- University guest lectures

**Start small:** Local veteran groups, Rotary clubs, chambers of commerce. Build your speaking reputation.

**Get paid:** Professional speakers make $2K-$10K+ per engagement. E9s with good content and delivery can build speaking income.

**Thought leadership:** Write on LinkedIn. Share leadership insights. Build your brand as a leadership expert. This attracts consulting and coaching opportunities.

## The timeline reality

Finding the right executive role takes longer than finding a manager job.

**Expect:** 3-6 months for a good fit at the right level
**Don't panic at:** 6-9 months if you're targeting senior roles

Executive hiring moves slower. Companies conduct more interviews. They want multiple candidates. The process is longer.

Use the time wisely:
- Get certified (PMP, coaching, change management)
- Build your LinkedIn presence
- Network strategically
- Consider interim consulting while you search
- Don't take a $75K manager role out of impatience

The right role at the right level is worth waiting for.

## The bottom line

You're in the top 1% of enlisted leadership. You advised CEOs. You shaped organizational culture. You developed dozens of leaders. You led enterprise transformation.

That's not a $75K manager. That's a $120K-$200K+ executive.

But positioning yourself at that level requires confidence, proper framing, and understanding your value.

Your resume needs to position you as an executive, not a retiree. Your LinkedIn needs to show executive presence. Your interviews need to demonstrate strategic thinking. Your salary expectations need to reflect your level.

You've already done executive-level work for years. Now claim the title and compensation that match.

Command Master Chief isn't middle management. It's C-suite equivalent.

Own it. Position yourself accordingly. Accept nothing less.
