## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 91F Small Arms/Artillery Repairers transitioning out—you're not just a gunsmith, you're a **specialized weapons technician with firearms expertise, precision maintenance skills, armament systems knowledge, troubleshooting abilities, safety discipline, and proven experience maintaining mission-critical weapons systems**. Your hands-on experience repairing rifles, pistols, machine guns, grenade launchers, and artillery weapons translates to specialized civilian careers in firearms manufacturing, law enforcement, defense contracting, and sporting goods industries. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$40,000-$52,000** for entry-level gunsmiths or retail armorers, scaling to **$60,000-$75,000+** with 3-5 years experience at firearms manufacturers or as law enforcement armorers. Top-tier master gunsmiths, defense contractor technicians, or custom firearms builders can earn **$75,000-$100,000+**. You've got specialized skills in a niche but passionate industry—deploy them strategically.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 91F separating hears the same concern: "Aren't gun industry jobs hard to find and don't they pay poorly?"

Here's the reality: **The firearms industry is a $28 billion sector with consistent demand for qualified technicians. While it's true that retail gunsmith jobs start lower than other trades, specialized roles—firearms manufacturing, defense contractors, law enforcement armorers, custom builders—pay competitive wages. Your military weapons maintenance experience opens doors most civilian gunsmiths can't access.**

You didn't just "clean guns." You:
- Performed depot and organizational maintenance on M4/M16 rifles, M9/M17 pistols, M2 .50 cal machine guns, M249/M240 machine guns, M320 grenade launchers
- Repaired and maintained artillery weapons systems (M119 howitzer, M777, M109 paladin)
- Diagnosed malfunctions using technical manuals and diagnostic procedures
- Replaced barrels, bolts, firing pins, extractors, and other critical components
- Performed headspace and timing on crew-served weapons
- Conducted test firing and function checks
- Maintained detailed repair records and parts accountability
- Used precision measurement tools (headspace gauges, timing gauges, micrometers)
- Applied armorer-level expertise across multiple weapons platforms
- Maintained security and accountability for sensitive military weapons

That's precision mechanics, technical troubleshooting, quality control, and weapons systems expertise. The civilian firearms world values those skills—but you need to target the right sectors where military weapons experience matters.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest about civilian skills you don't have:

**Custom gunsmithing techniques:** Military armoring is maintenance and repair using factory parts. Custom gunsmithing involves stock work, metal finishing, trigger jobs, custom modifications, bedding, and aesthetic work. These require additional training beyond military 91F experience.

**Business operations (if going independent):** Running a gunsmith business requires FFL management (extensive record-keeping, ATF compliance), liability insurance, customer acquisition, pricing, invoicing, and tax planning. Many 91Fs have technical skills but struggle with regulatory compliance and business administration.

**Civilian market preferences:** Civilian firearms market emphasizes different aspects than military—aesthetics, custom features, accuracy tuning, hunting applications. Military focuses on durability and function. Understanding civilian customer desires requires market knowledge.

**Sales and customer service:** Retail and range positions require sales skills, conflict resolution, and customer service—very different from military armorer work where you just maintain weapons and return them to units.

**Patience with slow career build:** Unlike other trades where certifications immediately boost pay, gunsmithing reputation and income build slowly over years. Many gunsmiths work other jobs while establishing their business. Be prepared for 3-5 year build period.
