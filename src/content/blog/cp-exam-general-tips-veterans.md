# C&P Exam Tips: 15 Things Every Veteran Should Know

## Bottom Line Up Front

The Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam is often the most important factor in your VA disability rating. This single exam can mean the difference between 30% and 70%, between $500/month and $1,500/month. The examiner's report carries enormous weight. **Your job:** ensure the exam accurately reflects your condition. These 15 tips will help you prepare, perform, and avoid the mistakes that hurt thousands of veterans every year.

## What Is a C&P Exam?

A C&P (Compensation and Pension) exam is a medical examination ordered by the VA to:
1. Verify you have the condition you're claiming
2. Determine the severity of your condition
3. Establish whether it's connected to your military service

The examiner may be:
- A VA employee at a VA medical center
- A contract examiner (VES, LHI, QTC) at a private facility
- Conducted via telehealth for some conditions

**Key fact:** The C&P examiner is NOT your doctor. They're not there to treat you. They're evaluating you for the VA. Treat it like a job interview where you're demonstrating your disability.

## The 15 Essential Tips

### Tip 1: Don't Minimize Your Symptoms

This is the #1 mistake veterans make.

Military culture taught you to push through pain, never complain, never show weakness. That mentality will cost you money at a C&P exam.

**The Problem:** Veterans say things like:
- "It's not that bad"
- "I can still function"
- "Other guys have it worse"
- "I just deal with it"

**The Reality:** The examiner documents exactly what you say. If you minimize, you get a lower rating.

**What to Do:** Be honest about your limitations. Describe your worst days. Don't exaggerate, but don't downplay either.

**Instead of:** "My back hurts sometimes"
**Say:** "I have constant back pain rated 5-6/10 daily. On bad days it's 8-9/10. I can't sit for more than 30 minutes. I can't bend to tie my shoes without severe pain. I've had to modify how I do everything."

### Tip 2: Describe Your Worst Days

The VA doesn't rate you on your best days. They need to understand your condition at its worst.

**Tell the examiner:**
- How often bad days occur
- How severe symptoms are on bad days
- What you can't do on bad days
- How long bad days/flare-ups last

**Example:** "Today is actually a decent day. But 3-4 times a week, my pain is severe. During those flare-ups, I can barely get out of bed. I've missed work because of it. The pain lasts 1-2 days when it's bad."

### Tip 3: Connect Everything to Function

Symptoms alone don't determine ratings. **Functional impact** does.

For every symptom, explain how it affects your ability to:
- Work
- Take care of yourself
- Do household tasks
- Participate in activities
- Maintain relationships

**Instead of:** "I have knee pain"
**Say:** "My knee pain prevents me from standing more than 15 minutes. I can't climb stairs without holding the rail. I had to quit my job as a warehouse worker. I can't play with my kids on the floor."

### Tip 4: Know What the Examiner Is Looking For

Different conditions have specific rating criteria. Know yours.

**Musculoskeletal (back, knees, shoulders):**
- Range of motion measurements
- Pain with movement
- Flare-ups and additional limitation
- Functional impact

**Mental Health (PTSD, anxiety, depression):**
- Symptom frequency and severity
- Occupational impairment
- Social impairment
- Hospitalization history

**Sleep Apnea:**
- CPAP use (50% rating)
- Daytime symptoms
- Sleep study results

**Research your specific condition's rating criteria before the exam.**

### Tip 5: Prepare a Written Summary

Don't rely on memory during the exam. Write down:

1. **Timeline of your condition**
   - When it started
   - How it's progressed
   - Key events and treatments

2. **Current symptoms**
   - List each symptom
   - Frequency and severity
   - What triggers them

3. **Flare-ups**
   - How often
   - How severe
   - What causes them
   - How long they last

4. **Functional limitations**
   - What you can't do
   - Work impact
   - Daily life impact

5. **Treatment history**
   - Medications (current and past)
   - Therapies
   - Surgeries
   - Doctors seen

Bring this list to the exam. Reference it. Leave a copy with the examiner.

### Tip 6: Bring Documentation

The examiner has your claims file, but bring copies of key evidence:

**Essential:**
- List of all medications with dosages
- Names and contact info of treating doctors
- Summary of relevant treatments

**Helpful:**
- Private medical records supporting your claim
- Buddy/lay statements
- Personal statement
- Symptom diary or journal

**For musculoskeletal exams:**
- Bring and wear any assistive devices (brace, cane)
- Bring recent X-rays or MRI reports

### Tip 7: Don't Try to "Perform"

Some veterans think they need to act sicker than they are. Don't.

Examiners are trained to detect exaggeration. If caught, your credibility is destroyed, and your claim may be denied.

**The Balance:**
- Don't exaggerate
- Don't minimize
- Be consistently honest
- Describe your typical and worst experiences

### Tip 8: Understand Flare-Ups (DeLuca Factors)

For musculoskeletal conditions, **flare-ups are critical**.

Under *DeLuca v. Brown*, the examiner must consider additional functional loss during flare-ups due to:
- Pain
- Weakness
- Fatigability
- Incoordination

**What to tell the examiner:**
- "I have flare-ups about [X] times per [week/month]"
- "During flare-ups, I lose an additional [X] degrees of motion"
- "Flare-ups are triggered by [activity, weather, etc.]"
- "They last [duration]"

**If the examiner doesn't ask about flare-ups, bring it up yourself.**

### Tip 9: Don't Assume the Examiner Read Your File

Examiners see many veterans each day. They may not have thoroughly reviewed your file.

**Be prepared to explain:**
- Your military service
- The in-service event that caused/aggravated your condition
- Your treatment history
- Your current symptoms

Don't assume they know anything. Cover the key points.

### Tip 10: Arrive Early and Be Professional

- Arrive 10-15 minutes early
- Bring your ID and appointment letter
- Be polite and cooperative
- Don't argue with the examiner

**However:** Being professional doesn't mean being passive. If the examiner doesn't ask about something important, volunteer the information.

### Tip 11: Don't Take Medications That Mask Symptoms

If your pain medication makes you feel significantly better right before the exam, the examiner sees you at your best, not your typical state.

**Consider:**
- Taking medications as normally scheduled (don't skip doses)
- But don't take extra medication to feel better for the exam
- If asked about medications, explain their effect

**Important:** Don't go off necessary medications just for the exam if it could harm you. Just be honest about medication effects.

### Tip 12: Request Specific Testing If Needed

For some conditions, specific tests are important:

**Orthopedic:**
- Range of motion testing (required)
- Stability testing
- Repetitive use testing
- Flare-up assessment

**Mental Health:**
- Full evaluation of all symptoms
- Assessment of occupational/social impairment

**If the examiner doesn't perform a necessary test, ask:** "Are you going to test my [stability/range of motion after repetitive use/etc.]?"

### Tip 13: Know When Something Is Wrong

Sometimes exams are inadequate. Red flags include:

- Extremely short exam (5-10 minutes for a complex condition)
- Examiner doesn't perform necessary tests
- Examiner doesn't ask about flare-ups or functional impact
- Examiner seems dismissive or disbelieving
- Examiner doesn't ask about your military service

**What to do:**
- Note exactly what happened and how long the exam lasted
- Document any concerns immediately after
- Request a copy of the exam report
- If inadequate, request a new exam or submit a complaint

### Tip 14: Take Notes After the Exam

Immediately after your exam, write down:
- What was asked
- What tests were performed
- How long the exam lasted
- Anything concerning or that seemed wrong
- What you said about key symptoms

This documentation helps if you need to appeal or request a new exam.

### Tip 15: Follow Up and Review the Report

After your rating decision:

1. **Request a copy of the C&P exam report** through eBenefits or VA.gov
2. **Review for accuracy:**
   - Are your symptoms correctly recorded?
   - Did the examiner note your flare-ups?
   - Is the range of motion accurate?
   - Is the nexus opinion reasonable?

3. **If inaccurate:**
   - File a Higher-Level Review for clear errors
   - File a Supplemental Claim with new evidence
   - Get a private medical opinion to counter the exam

## What to Say: Example Scripts

### When Asked About Pain Level

**Weak:** "It hurts"
**Strong:** "On a daily basis, my pain is a 5-6 out of 10. On bad days, it's an 8-9. The pain is constant—it never fully goes away. It's worse in the morning and after activity. It's a sharp, stabbing pain in my lower back that sometimes radiates down my leg."

### When Asked About Daily Function

**Weak:** "I manage"
**Strong:** "My condition significantly limits my daily activities. I can't sit for more than 30 minutes without pain. I can't bend to pick things up. I can't exercise or play sports. I've had to modify how I shower, dress, and sleep. My wife has to help me with household tasks."

### When Asked About Work Impact

**Weak:** "I still work"
**Strong:** "I can still work, but with significant limitations. I've had to change positions because I couldn't handle the physical demands. I miss work 2-3 days per month due to flare-ups. I need frequent breaks. My productivity has decreased."

### When Asked About Flare-Ups

**Weak:** "Sometimes it gets worse"
**Strong:** "I have flare-ups about 3 times per week. During a flare-up, my pain increases from 5/10 to 8/10, and I lose about 20 degrees of motion. Flare-ups are triggered by activity, weather changes, and prolonged sitting. They last 1-2 days."

## After the Exam: What Happens Next

1. **Examiner completes report:** 2-4 weeks
2. **VA reviews all evidence:** Variable
3. **Rating decision issued:** Typically 30-90 days post-exam
4. **You receive notification:** Letter explaining rating and compensation

**If dissatisfied:**
- Higher-Level Review (for errors)
- Supplemental Claim (with new evidence)
- Board of Veterans' Appeals

## Final Thoughts

The C&P exam is your opportunity to ensure the VA understands your condition. Don't let military toughness or modesty cost you the rating you deserve.

**Remember:**
- Be honest, not exaggerated
- Don't minimize
- Describe worst days and flare-ups
- Connect symptoms to functional impact
- Come prepared with documentation
- Take notes after

Your service earned you the right to these benefits. Make sure your C&P exam reflects that.
