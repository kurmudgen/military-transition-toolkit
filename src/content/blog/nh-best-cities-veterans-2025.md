# Best Cities in New Hampshire for Veterans 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Portsmouth ranks #1 for New Hampshire veterans—it's safe, has excellent quality of life, strong veteran community, proximity to healthcare (40 min to Manchester VA), and sits on the seacoast with median homes at $585,000. Manchester takes #2, offering the best job opportunities, direct access to VA Medical Center, and more affordable housing at $480,000 median.

For affordability, Berlin and Claremont offer median home prices under $200,000, though they're remote with limited jobs. Concord balances cost ($390,000 median), state government jobs with veteran preference, and 30-minute access to Manchester VA.

New Hampshire's challenge is expensive housing—statewide median is $463,000, well above national average ($404,400). However, no income tax saves $2,000-$5,000 annually for military retirees, and 100% disabled veterans get full property tax exemptions worth $7,000-$10,000+ annually, substantially offsetting costs.

Overall, NH cities excel for quality of life, safety, veteran employment (0.2% unemployment—best in nation), but you'll pay premium housing costs. Best for veterans prioritizing excellent schools, low crime, outdoor recreation, and tax savings.
