**Advocacy note:** Veterans and families interested in expanded services should contact the Vermont Office of Veterans Affairs and state legislators to support funding increases for the Veterans' Home.

## Education Benefits: Vermont National Guard Tuition Program

Vermont offers one of the nation's most generous state-level education benefits for National Guard members through the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit Program.

### Program Overview

The Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit provides **full tuition coverage** for active Vermont National Guard members in good standing, covering in-state tuition rates at Vermont colleges and universities.

**Established:** 1999 (expanded in 2018)

**Administered by:** Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (VSAC)
**Contact:** (802) 655-9602 or tuitionbenefit@vsac.org
**Website:** vsac.org/vermont-national-guard-tuition-benefit-program

### Coverage Amounts

**Vermont State College System institutions (including Community College of Vermont):** Full in-state tuition
**University of Vermont:** Full in-state tuition
**Vermont private colleges:** Up to the UVM in-state tuition rate
**Eligible training institutions:** Lower of institution's standard tuition or UVM in-state tuition rate

**UVM in-state tuition (2024-25):** $18,890 per year
**Vermont State Colleges in-state tuition (2024-25):** $11,712 per year
**Community College of Vermont (2024-25):** $8,280 per year

This means Guard members can receive **$18,890 per year** in tuition benefits if attending UVM, or up to that amount at private Vermont colleges like Middlebury, Norwich, or Champlain College.

### Eligibility Requirements

**Service requirement:** Must be an active member of the Vermont National Guard in good standing

**Education level:** Available for undergraduate, graduate, certificate, and non-degree continuing education programs

**Federal benefits requirement:** Must exhaust any Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition benefits and other federally funded military tuition assistance BEFORE accessing this benefit (Vermont benefit serves as a "last-payer" after federal benefits)

**Residency:** No Vermont residency requirement—benefits apply regardless of where Guard member lives

**Academic standing:** Must maintain satisfactory academic progress at your institution

**Service obligation:** Tuition benefits are structured as an **interest-free loan that is forgiven** upon completion of service obligations. Typically, you must complete **2 years of service in the Vermont National Guard for each full-time academic year** (12+ credits) paid through the program. Part-time students have prorated obligations.

### Application Process

1. **Meet with Vermont National Guard Education Office** - Contact your unit's education officer or the state Education Office at (802) 338-3371
2. **Confirm eligibility** - Verify you've exhausted federal benefits (or certify none are available)
3. **Complete VSAC application** - Apply online at vsac.org during the application period
4. **Sign promissory note** - Acknowledge service obligation to have loan forgiven
5. **Provide enrollment verification** - Submit proof of enrollment from your college each semester
6. **Funding awarded** - Benefits are paid directly to your institution

**Application deadlines:**
- Fall semester: August 1
- Spring semester: December 1
- Summer term: May 1

**Funding limitation:** Program operates on a first-come, first-served basis until funds are exhausted. Apply early in each application cycle.

### What's Not Covered

The tuition benefit covers only **tuition**—not fees, books, room and board, or other expenses. You'll need to budget for:
- Mandatory student fees: $1,000-2,500/year
- Books and supplies: $800-1,200/year
- Housing: $8,000-15,000/year (if not living at home)
- Meals: $4,000-6,000/year

Plan to combine this benefit with:
- Federal Pell Grants (for eligible low-income students)
- Vermont State Grants
- Scholarships
- Part-time employment
- Federal student loans (if needed for living expenses)

### Recent Improvements (2022)

Vermont increased funding for the National Guard Tuition Benefit in 2022, expanding the number of Guard members who can access the program annually. Previous funding caps meant some qualified applicants couldn't receive benefits; expanded funding has reduced (though not eliminated) this issue.

## Education Benefits: Vermont State Colleges and Universities

Vermont colleges and universities provide robust support for veterans using federal GI Bill benefits, active-duty service members, and military family members.

### University of Vermont (UVM) - Burlington

**Office of Veterans Services**
**Location:** Waterman Building, 85 South Prospect Street, Burlington, VT 05405
**Phone:** (802) 656-3356
**Email:** veterans@uvm.edu
**Website:** uvm.edu/registrar/va-benefits

#### In-State Tuition for GI Bill Users

Federal law requires UVM to charge **in-state tuition rates** to veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33), Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (Chapter 35), and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Chapter 31) benefits, even if they're classified as out-of-state residents.

**Savings for out-of-state veterans:** $27,864 per year
- Out-of-state tuition: $46,754
- In-state tuition: $18,890
- **Annual savings: $27,864**

#### Yellow Ribbon Program

UVM participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program, which provides additional tuition assistance beyond the Post-9/11 GI Bill's coverage.

**Undergraduate students:** Unlimited participants, unlimited maximum contribution per student
**Graduate College students:** 2 students per year, up to $5,000 each
**Larner College of Medicine students:** 5 students per year, up to $10,000 each

**How it works:** The Yellow Ribbon Program splits the cost of tuition exceeding the GI Bill cap. If your tuition exceeds the GI Bill's payment, UVM contributes 50% of the excess and the VA matches it, covering 100% of the overage.

**Example:** Out-of-state graduate student with Post-9/11 GI Bill
- Graduate tuition: $20,000/year
- GI Bill covers: $28,937.88 (2024-25 Vermont maximum)
- Tuition is fully covered by GI Bill alone; Yellow Ribbon isn't needed

For medical students with higher tuition ($60,000+), Yellow Ribbon provides critical gap coverage.

#### Prior Learning Assessment for Military Training

UVM evaluates military training and experience for potential college credit through:
- American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations
- Joint Services Transcript (JST) review
- Portfolio assessment

**Potential credits:** 0-30 credits depending on military experience, MOSs, and training schools

**How to apply:** Submit your JST to the Registrar's Office along with a credit evaluation request. Processing typically takes 4-6 weeks.

#### Student Veteran Services

- Dedicated Veterans Services Coordinator (full-time staff member who is a veteran)
- Student Veterans of America (SVA) chapter on campus
- Veteran-specific orientation programs
- Study spaces reserved for student veterans
- Peer mentorship programs

### Vermont State University (formerly Vermont State Colleges)

**Veterans Services Contact:**

**Email:** veterans@vermontstate.edu
**Website:** vermontstate.edu/admission/veterans-military-service-members

#### In-State Tuition for Veterans

Like UVM, Vermont State University charges in-state tuition rates to GI Bill users regardless of residency.

**In-state tuition (2024-25):** $11,712

**Savings for out-of-state veterans:** $15,432 per year

### Norwich University - Northfield, VT (Private Military College)

**Office of Military and Veterans Programs**
**Phone:** (802) 485-2531

**Unique benefit:** Military structure and culture feels familiar to veterans, easing the transition to civilian college life.

## Employment Resources and State Hiring Preference

### Vermont State Employment Preference

Vermont law provides hiring preference points to veterans applying for state government positions.

**Preference points:**
- **Veterans:** 5 points added to employment test score
- **Disabled veterans:** 10 points added to employment test score

**How it works:** When applying for a Vermont state job that involves a competitive examination or scored evaluation, your veteran status earns you additional points that can move you ahead of non-veteran applicants with similar qualifications.

**Eligibility requirement:** Honorable discharge from U.S. Armed Forces

**Expanded job access:** Vermont law also allows eligible veterans to apply for certain state jobs that are normally available only to current state employees, providing broader job opportunities.

**Spousal benefits:** If a veteran is totally disabled and unable to work, preference points transfer to the spouse. If the veteran dies, the surviving spouse retains the preference provided they remain unmarried.

**How to claim:** When applying for state positions through the Vermont Department of Human Resources careers portal (careers.vermont.gov), indicate your veteran status and provide a copy of your DD-214 when requested.

**Contact:** Vermont Department of Human Resources
**Phone:** (802) 828-3454

**Q: Can I use the VA healthcare system if I'm already enrolled in Medicare or private insurance?**

A: Yes, absolutely. VA healthcare is available regardless of other insurance. However, if you have other coverage, the VA may bill your insurance for certain services. You're never charged more than you would pay under your VA copay requirements. Many veterans use both VA and non-VA providers, getting primary care at the VA while using Medicare or private insurance for specialty care or services not available at the VA.

**Q: What if I live in Vermont but closer to a VA facility in New Hampshire or New York?**

A: Veterans can receive care at any VA facility nationwide. If you're closer to the White River Junction VA or a New Hampshire CBOC (Littleton or Keene), you can access care there. If you're near the New York border, you might find facilities in Albany or Plattsburgh more convenient. Enroll at White River Junction VA, then request transfer of care to the most convenient facility.

**Q: How do I get my medications refilled through the VA?**

A: Three options: (1) Call the VA pharmacy refill line at (802) 295-9363 and select the pharmacy option; (2) Use the VA's My HealtheVet website to request refills online; (3) Sign up for VA mail-order pharmacy—prescriptions are automatically refilled and mailed to your home with free shipping, typically arriving in 3-5 days.

**Q: Is mental health counseling really confidential at the VA?**

A: Yes. Your mental health records are protected by HIPAA and additional VA confidentiality regulations. Mental health providers cannot share information with your command (if you're in the Guard or Reserves), your employer, or family members without your written authorization. The only exception is imminent risk of harm to yourself or others. Many veterans worry about stigma—VA providers are experienced, nonjudgmental, and focused solely on your wellbeing.

**Q: Can I use both the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit and the Post-9/11 GI Bill?**

A: Yes, but there's a specific order. You must exhaust your federal Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition benefits FIRST. Once your GI Bill benefits are used up, you can then access the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit for remaining education. This is intentional—federal benefits don't require service obligations, while the Vermont benefit requires 2 years of Guard service per year of tuition. Use federal benefits first, then state benefits to extend your education funding.

**Q: Does the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit cover graduate school?**

A: Yes. The benefit covers undergraduate, graduate, certificate programs, and eligible continuing education courses. However, graduate tuition at Vermont institutions can exceed the benefit cap (UVM in-state tuition rate of $18,890/year), meaning you'd be responsible for the difference. Still, it's an excellent benefit for master's degrees, particularly at Vermont State University where graduate tuition is lower.

**Q: I'm separating from active duty and planning to use my GI Bill at UVM. Do I automatically get in-state tuition?**

A: Yes, if you're using Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33), Vocational Rehabilitation (Chapter 31), or Survivors' and Dependents' Assistance (Chapter 35) benefits, federal law requires UVM to charge you in-state tuition rates even if you're from out of state. However, you must live in Vermont OR be assigned to a duty station in Vermont (for active-duty students). After three years of continuous enrollment, you can maintain in-state tuition even if you move out of state.

**Q: How do I get college credit for my military training and experience?**

A: Request your Joint Services Transcript (JST) at jst.doded.mil. Submit the JST to your college's registrar or prior learning assessment office. Colleges use American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations to award credit for formal military training schools. Informal experience can be evaluated through portfolio assessment. Expect to receive anywhere from 0-30 credits depending on your MOS, schools attended, and the college's policies.

**Q: What's the difference between the Vermont State Veterans' Home and the VA Medical Center?**

A: They're completely separate facilities. The Vermont State Veterans' Home in Bennington is a state-operated nursing home providing long-term residential care for veterans who need skilled nursing (similar to a civilian nursing home). The VA Medical Center in White River Junction is a federal VA hospital providing medical treatment, surgery, and outpatient care—you go there for appointments but don't live there. Think of it this way: you see your doctor at the VA Medical Center; if you eventually need long-term nursing care, you'd move into the Veterans' Home.

**Q: Can my spouse or dependent children receive healthcare at the VA?**

A: Generally, no. VA healthcare is for veterans only. However, there are exceptions: (1) Spouses and dependents can receive counseling at Vet Centers for issues related to the veteran's service; (2) The CHAMPVA program provides health insurance to dependents of certain veterans (100% disabled or deceased in the line of duty); (3) Some VA facilities offer limited services to family members under specific programs. For primary healthcare, spouses and dependents typically need private insurance, Medicaid, or employer coverage.

**Q: How does the 5-point veteran hiring preference actually work when I apply for Vermont state jobs?**

A: When you apply for a competitive state position, you'll be evaluated on qualifications, experience, and potentially a scored exam or assessment. If you're a veteran, 5 points are added to your final score (10 points if you're a disabled veteran). Example: You score 85 on the assessment; with 5-point preference, your final score is 90. This can move you ahead of non-veteran candidates with similar or even slightly higher raw scores. To claim the preference, indicate your veteran status on the application and provide your DD-214 when requested.

**Q: Is the Vermont Department of Labor's veteran employment help actually useful, or is it just generic career counseling?**

A: It's genuinely useful. Vermont's Veteran Services Coordinators are veterans themselves who understand military experience and how to translate your MOS and skills to civilian job language. They have connections to employers actively seeking veteran employees and can make warm introductions. They're also familiar with federal veteran hiring programs and can help navigate USAJOBS for federal positions. That said, like any service, effectiveness varies by individual counselor—if you don't connect with one, try a different regional office.

**Q: What's the veteran unemployment rate in Vermont compared to civilian unemployment?**

A: Specific quarterly Vermont veteran unemployment data isn't published separately, but national trends show veteran unemployment at 3.0% vs. 3.9% for non-veterans (2024). Vermont's overall unemployment is typically at or below the national average, suggesting Vermont veteran unemployment is likely in the 2.8-3.5% range. Vermont's strong economy, low population, and robust veteran hiring programs contribute to low veteran unemployment.

**Q: Can I use my GI Bill for trade schools and certifications, or only for college degrees?**

A: You can use GI Bill benefits for approved certificate programs, apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and flight training, not just degrees. For example, you could attend Vermont Adult Learning programs for CNA certification, Vermont Technical College for welding certification, or use benefits during a plumbing apprenticeship through Helmets to Hardhats. The program must be approved for VA education benefits—check with the school or program.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled through the VA. Do I get priority for hiring at Vermont state jobs?**

A: You receive 10-point preference on employment test scores (vs. 5 points for non-disabled veterans), which gives you significant advantage. However, this is a preference, not a guarantee—you still must meet minimum qualifications and compete with other candidates. That said, many Vermont state agencies actively recruit veterans, particularly disabled veterans, and the 10-point preference can be decisive in close competitions.

**Q: What if I need emergency care after hours or on weekends?**

A: The White River Junction VA Medical Center has a 24/7 Emergency Department for urgent medical issues. Call ahead at (802) 295-9363 if possible, but walk-ins are accepted. For life-threatening emergencies, call 911 or go to the nearest civilian emergency room—VA will typically cover emergency care at non-VA facilities if it was a true emergency and you notify VA within 72 hours. For mental health crises, call the Veterans Crisis Line at 988 (press 1) any time, day or night.

**Q: Can I receive care at a CBOC instead of traveling to White River Junction?**

A: Yes. CBOCs provide primary care, mental health services, lab work, and some specialty care. You can receive most routine care at the CBOC nearest you. Complex cases, surgery, imaging, and certain specialty services require travel to White River Junction, but 70-80% of your appointments can be handled at CBOCs. Let your provider know you prefer the CBOC for convenience.

**Q: If I'm denied VA healthcare enrollment, what are my options?**

A: If denied, you'll receive a letter explaining why. Common reasons include not meeting service requirements, discharge characterization issues, or high income with no service-connected disabilities (low priority group). You can appeal the decision or provide additional documentation. Even if denied for full VA healthcare, you may still qualify for specific services like mental health counseling at Vet Centers (available to all combat veterans) or state-funded veteran programs. Contact a County Veteran Service Officer for assistance with appeals.

**Q: Does Vermont offer any veteran education benefits beyond the National Guard Tuition Benefit?**

A: The National Guard program is Vermont's primary state-level education benefit. However, all Vermont colleges offer in-state tuition to GI Bill users (federal law), and most participate in Yellow Ribbon programs, effectively making education very affordable or free for veterans with GI Bill benefits. Additionally, many Vermont colleges offer institutional scholarships specifically for veterans—contact financial aid offices to inquire.

**Q: How do I find out about job openings specifically seeking veterans?**

A: (1) Visit careers.vermont.gov and filter for veteran-preference positions; (2) Use USAJOBS.gov for federal positions with veteran preference; (3) Meet with Vermont Department of Labor Veteran Services Coordinator who has direct connections to employers; (4) Join Vermont veteran Facebook groups where employers post openings; (5) Attend veteran job fairs hosted by Vermont Department of Labor and veteran organizations.

**Q: Is there help available if I'm a veteran facing homelessness or about to become homeless?**

A: Yes, immediate help is available. Call the White River Junction VA at (802) 295-9363 and ask for the Homeless Veteran Coordinator. Resources include: (1) HUD-VASH housing vouchers + case management; (2) Vermont Veterans Place transitional housing in Burlington; (3) Emergency financial assistance; (4) Supportive services including employment help and healthcare. Don't wait until you're on the street—reach out as soon as housing becomes unstable.

**Q: Can I bring a family member or friend to my VA medical appointments?**

A: Absolutely. Many veterans bring a spouse, family member, or battle buddy to appointments for support and to help remember information. However, if you want your guest to speak with your provider or access your medical information, you'll need to complete a VA authorization form (available from your provider) due to HIPAA privacy laws.
