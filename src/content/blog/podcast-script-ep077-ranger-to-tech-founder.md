[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

What if I told you that an Army Ranger with no tech background built a cybersecurity startup that's now valued at $5 million—just four years after leaving the military? Meet Marcus Thompson, who went from leading direct action missions in Afghanistan to founding SecureVet Solutions, a company that helps businesses protect against cyber threats using security protocols he developed based on military operational security principles.

Marcus left the Army in 2020 as an E-7 Ranger with 12 years of service. He had no college degree, no tech certifications, and no business experience. What he did have was leadership experience, an understanding of risk mitigation, and the ability to learn quickly under pressure. Today, his company has 15 employees, serves 200+ clients, and generates $5 million in annual revenue.

This is Jacob, your host on the Veteran Transition Blueprint podcast. Today we're breaking down Marcus's transition from Army Ranger to tech entrepreneur—covering how he identified his business opportunity, learned the technical skills he needed, secured his first clients, and scaled his company. This is a real success story with actionable lessons for any veteran considering entrepreneurship.

Let's get into it.

**The Military Background**

Marcus joined the Army at 18, assigned to 75th Ranger Regiment after completing RASP. He deployed six times between 2008-2019—three to Afghanistan, two to Iraq, one to Africa. As a squad leader and later platoon sergeant, he led high-risk missions requiring meticulous planning, real-time adaptation, and flawless execution.

"In the Rangers, you learn that 90% of mission success happens in the planning phase," Marcus explains. "We'd spend days planning a 30-minute operation. Risk assessment, contingency plans, communication protocols—everything had to be airtight. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was learning operational security principles that would become the foundation of my business."

By 2019, Marcus knew it was time to transition. He was physically broken down—chronic back and knee injuries from jumps and heavy kit. He was rated 70% disabled by the VA for back, knee, and PTSD. "I could've stayed until 20, but my body was telling me it was time. I separated in March 2020 with 12 years of service."

**The Transition Period: Finding the Problem**

Marcus used his terminal leave to take a coding bootcamp—a 16-week intensive program in Austin, Texas. "Everyone told me tech was hiring veterans, so I figured I'd learn to code. I used my GI Bill for the bootcamp."

But Marcus struggled with pure software development. "I wasn't naturally good at coding. I could do it, but there were 22-year-olds in my class who were 10x better. I wasn't going to compete on pure technical skills."

Instead, Marcus noticed a pattern: small and mid-sized businesses needed cybersecurity help but couldn't afford expensive consultants. "I talked to a dozen business owners during my bootcamp. They all said the same thing: 'We know we need better security, but we don't know where to start, and the quotes we get are $50,000-100,000.'"

Marcus saw an opportunity. He understood operational security from the military. He knew how to assess risks, create protocols, and train teams. "I realized I could translate military OPSEC principles into business cybersecurity. Not the super technical stuff—just the basics that most small businesses were getting completely wrong."

---

**Year 1: Building the Foundation (2020)**

Marcus started SecureVet Solutions in May 2020 with $5,000 from his separation pay. "I had no clients, no team, just an idea. I spent the first month building a website and creating a service offering."

His initial service: 30-day cybersecurity assessments for small businesses ($3,000 flat fee). "I'd audit their systems, identify vulnerabilities, create a security protocol, and train their team. Think of it like a pre-mission brief for their business security."

**First Client:** A friend of a friend who owned a small medical practice. "I charged him $1,500 just to get started. I found 23 serious security gaps—weak passwords, no two-factor authentication, employees clicking phishing emails constantly. I created a simple security protocol and trained his staff. It took me about 40 hours total."

The client was thrilled and referred Marcus to two other businesses. By December 2020, Marcus had completed 8 assessments, earning $21,000 in total revenue. "It wasn't much, but it proved the model worked. Small businesses needed this service, and they'd pay for it if the price was reasonable."

---

**Year 2: Scaling Up (2021)**

In 2021, Marcus added recurring services: monthly security monitoring and quarterly training for $500/month. "One-time assessments were good, but I needed recurring revenue to build a real business."

He also hired his first employee—another veteran from his Ranger battalion who had studied cybersecurity after service. "I couldn't do this alone. I needed someone who understood the military mindset but also had deeper technical skills than me."

By end of 2021:
- 32 clients on monthly service plans
- 15 one-time assessments completed
- $180,000 in annual revenue
- 2 employees (Marcus + 1)

**Key Lesson from Year 2:** "I learned that veteran clients trusted me immediately because of my background. About 40% of our early clients were veteran-owned businesses. They understood the value of operational discipline and security protocols."

---

**Year 3: Productizing the Service (2022)**

In 2022, Marcus created a software tool that automated parts of his assessment process. "I was doing the same checks manually for every client—password strength audits, phishing tests, access control reviews. I worked with a developer to build a tool that automated 60% of this work."

The software reduced assessment time from 40 hours to 15 hours, allowing Marcus to serve more clients without adding staff proportionally.

He also expanded his team to 5 people and moved into a small office space. "We were profitable, growing 150% year-over-year, and I started to realize this could be a real company, not just a consulting gig."

By end of 2022:
- 85 clients on monthly plans
- $450,000 in annual revenue
- 5 employees
- Profitable (25% profit margin)

**Year 4: Building a Real Company (2023-2024)**

In 2023, Marcus raised $500,000 from angel investors (mostly veteran entrepreneurs) to accelerate growth. "I used the money to hire a sales team, improve our software, and expand marketing. Up until then, everything was word-of-mouth."

The investment paid off. By mid-2024:
- 200+ clients on monthly plans
- $5 million annual revenue run rate
- 15 employees
- Expanded to three cities (Austin, San Antonio, Houston)

"We're now at a point where the company runs without me being involved in every client engagement," Marcus says. "I've transitioned from being a technician to being a CEO. That required a whole different set of skills—delegation, strategic planning, managing managers. Honestly, that's been harder than the technical side."

**Keys to Success: What Made This Work**

**1. Identified a Real Problem**
"I didn't build a solution looking for a problem. I found a real pain point—small businesses needed affordable cybersecurity—and built a service to solve it."

**2. Leveraged Military Experience**
"My value wasn't technical expertise—it was operational discipline, risk assessment, and training. Those are pure military skills applied to a civilian problem."

**3. Started Small and Iterated**
"I didn't try to build a $5M company on day one. I did one assessment for $1,500, learned from it, and improved. Minimum viable product, just like in tech."

**4. Hired Veterans Early**
"Every one of my first 10 employees was a veteran. They understood the culture I was trying to build—disciplined, mission-focused, team-oriented. That foundation still defines our company today."

**5. Stayed Patient**
"Year 1, I made $21,000. That's poverty-level income. But I believed in the vision, lived cheap, and reinvested every dollar into the business. It took 3 years to get to real scale."

---

**Challenges and Setbacks**

**Challenge 1: Imposter Syndrome**
"I'd be in meetings with clients who had MBAs and decades of business experience, and I'm a Ranger who barely graduated high school. I constantly felt like I didn't belong. It took years to build confidence."

**Challenge 2: Cash Flow**
"In Year 2, I almost went out of business. Three large clients left in the same month, and I couldn't make payroll. I had to take out a personal loan to keep the company alive. That was terrifying."

**Challenge 3: Mental Health**
"My PTSD got worse during the transition. Building a company is incredibly stressful, and I wasn't dealing with my service-related trauma. I finally got therapy through the VA in 2022, and it made a huge difference."

**Advice for Veterans Considering Entrepreneurship**

**1. "Start Before You're Ready"**
"I had no idea what I was doing when I started. But if I'd waited until I felt fully prepared, I'd still be waiting. Take the first step even if it's messy."

**2. "Use Your Military Skills—Don't Discount Them"**
"Leadership, planning, risk management, training—these are valuable business skills. You just have to translate them into civilian language."

**3. "Find a Problem You Care About Solving"**
"I care about helping small businesses protect themselves. That's what keeps me motivated when things get hard. If you're just chasing money, you'll quit when it gets tough."

**4. "Network with Other Veteran Entrepreneurs"**
"Some of my best mentors and investors are veterans who built companies. They understand the transition challenges and want to help. Use veteran entrepreneur networks like Bunker Labs, VetsinTech, or local veteran business organizations."

**5. "Take Care of Your Mental Health"**
"You can't build a successful business if you're falling apart mentally. Get therapy, use your VA benefits, talk to other veterans. The business will suffer if you don't deal with your transition trauma."
