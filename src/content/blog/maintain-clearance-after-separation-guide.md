# How to Maintain Your Security Clearance After Military Separation

Your security clearance doesn't disappear when you take off the uniform. But it does change status, and understanding what happens—and what you need to do—can mean the difference between preserving a valuable asset and watching it expire.

This guide covers everything you need to know about maintaining your clearance through military transition.

## Understanding Clearance Status

### Active vs. Current

These terms are different:

**Active Clearance:**
- Currently sponsored by an organization
- Able to access classified information
- In the system and usable

**Current Clearance:**
- Investigation completed within validity period
- Not currently sponsored/active
- Can be reactivated without new investigation

### What Happens at Separation

When you leave military service:
1. Your clearance becomes **inactive** (no longer sponsored)
2. Your investigation remains **current** (within validity period)
3. A new cleared employer can **reactivate** your clearance
4. If investigation expires, you need **reinvestigation**

### Investigation Validity Periods

| Clearance Level | Investigation Validity |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Confidential | 15 years |
| Secret | 10 years |
| Top Secret | 6 years |

**Important:** These are investigation validity periods, not clearance validity. Your clearance stays current for this period from your investigation date.

## The Critical Timeline

### Immediate Post-Separation

**Day 1 after separation:**
- Your clearance is now inactive
- Investigation is still current
- You can still access cleared employment
- Clock is ticking on investigation currency

### Currency Window

**If you find cleared employment:**
- Within currency period → Reactivation (fast)
- Outside currency period → Reinvestigation (slow)

### Example Timeline (Top Secret)

- **Investigation completed:** January 2022
- **Separate from military:** January 2025
- **Currency expires:** January 2028 (6 years from investigation)
- **Window to reactivate:** 3 years

### Example Timeline (Secret)

- **Investigation completed:** January 2020
- **Separate from military:** January 2025
- **Currency expires:** January 2030 (10 years from investigation)
- **Window to reactivate:** 5 years

## Keeping Your Clearance Active

### Best Strategy: No Gap

The optimal approach:
1. **Secure cleared job before separation**
2. **Transition directly** from military to contractor/federal
3. **Clearance transfers** without going inactive
4. **No gap, no questions, no delays**

### How Direct Transfer Works

When you have a job waiting:
1. New employer submits sponsorship request
2. Security office verifies your clearance in system
3. Clearance transfers to new facility clearance
4. You're active with new employer

**Timeline:** Days to a few weeks

### Reality Check

Not everyone can manage seamless transfer:
- Job search takes time
- Interview processes are lengthy
- Personal obligations may intervene
- Geographic moves require time

**This is okay**—you have options.

## Managing a Gap in Cleared Employment

### Short Gap (Under 24 Months)

If your gap is short:
- Investigation should still be current
- New employer can reactivate clearance
- No new investigation required
- Process is relatively quick

**Actions needed:**
- Document your investigation date
- Have separation paperwork ready
- Apply to cleared positions
- Be ready to verify clearance quickly

### Longer Gap (24+ Months)

If gap is extended:
- Investigation may still be current (check dates)
- Process may take longer
- Additional verification may be needed
- But still reactivatable if within currency

### Gap Near Currency Expiration

If nearing expiration:
- Act urgently on cleared employment
- Communicate timeline to employers
- Some may start process anyway
- Reinvestigation becomes necessary if it expires

## The Reactivation Process

### What Happens

When you're hired for cleared position after gap:

1. **Employer initiates:** Submits sponsorship to DCSA
2. **Verification:** DCSA confirms investigation currency
3. **Transfer:** Clearance activated under employer's facility
4. **Access:** You can now access classified material

### Timeline

Reactivation typically takes:
- **Ideal case:** 1-4 weeks
- **Typical case:** 2-8 weeks
- **Complicated case:** 2-3 months

Factors affecting timeline:
- Gap length
- Any issues discovered
- Employer security office speed
- DCSA workload

### What You Need to Provide

For reactivation:
- DD-214 (showing separation)
- Previous security clearance information
- Investigation date and type
- Any required forms (SF-86 update may be needed)

## When Reinvestigation Is Required

### Triggers for New Investigation

You need reinvestigation if:
- Investigation currency expired
- Upgrading clearance level (Secret → TS)
- Adding SCI access (may require new investigation)
- Significant adverse information

### Reinvestigation Process

What to expect:
- New SF-86 submission
- Full background investigation
- Personal interview possible
- Timeline: 6-18+ months

### Continuous Evaluation

Modern clearance maintenance:
- Automated monitoring
- Ongoing eligibility checks
- Replaces periodic reinvestigation
- Most cleared population now enrolled

## Protecting Your Clearance Eligibility

### Eligibility vs. Active Clearance

Even when clearance is inactive:
- You must maintain eligibility
- Issues can arise that affect future clearance
- Report requirements may still apply
- Lifestyle matters

### Things That Jeopardize Eligibility

**Financial Issues:**
- Bankruptcy
- Excessive debt
- Collections
- Unpaid taxes

**Criminal Activity:**
- Arrests
- Charges (even dismissed)
- Convictions
- Domestic violence

**Drug Use:**
- Illegal drug use
- Prescription abuse
- Marijuana (still federally illegal)

**Foreign Influence:**
- Marriage to foreign national
- Business dealings with foreign entities
- Substantial foreign contacts
- Foreign property ownership

**Mental Health:**
- Certain conditions may require review
- Seeking help is not disqualifying
- Failure to seek needed treatment is concerning
- Honesty about treatment is essential

### Best Practices During Gap

While between cleared jobs:
- **Financial:** Pay bills on time, avoid excessive debt
- **Legal:** Avoid any legal issues
- **Drugs:** Complete abstinence from illegal substances
- **Foreign:** Document any foreign contacts for future reporting
- **Honesty:** Be prepared to explain gap and activities

## Documentation You Need

### Before Separation

Collect and save:
- **Investigation information:** Date, type, agency
- **Clearance verification:** Any documentation of level
- **Access information:** SCI compartments, SAP accesses
- **Security manager contact:** In case questions arise

### After Separation

Keep accessible:
- **DD-214:** Shows military service and dates
- **Security documentation:** Whatever you have
- **SF-86 copy:** If you have one
- **References:** People who can verify clearance

### JPAS/DISS Information

When you have access to security systems:
- Note your investigation date
- Record type of investigation
- Document any special accesses
- Keep for your records

## Special Situations

### Reserve/Guard Status

If going to Reserve/Guard:
- Clearance may transfer with you
- Depends on billet requirements
- May maintain active status
- Confirm with unit security manager

### Federal Employment

If transitioning to federal civilian:
- Clearance typically transfers directly
- Same investigation supports federal service
- Process handled during hiring
- Often seamless if timed right

### Contractor to Contractor

If you've already separated and change contractors:
- Clearance transfers between contractors
- Process is routine
- May require brief gap during transfer
- Stay in touch with both security offices

### Extended Break

If taking significant time off:
- Know your currency timeline
- Document everything
- Maintain eligibility factors
- Plan return to cleared work before expiration

## Strategies by Clearance Level

### Secret Clearance

**10-year currency gives you time:**
- Less urgency than TS
- Can pursue education, other work
- Still valuable when you return
- Don't wait until last year though

### Top Secret Clearance

**6-year currency requires attention:**
- More valuable, less time to use it
- Plan cleared employment sooner
- Consider contractor work to maintain
- TS worth preserving

### TS/SCI Clearance

**Highest value, keep it active:**
- SCI access most valuable
- Consider interim cleared work
- Direct transition ideal
- Worth prioritizing

## Working with Employers

### Communicating Your Status

When job searching:
- Clearly state clearance level
- Note investigation date
- Indicate active/current status
- Be specific about any accesses

### Interview Discussion

In interviews:
- Confirm clearance status
- Discuss reactivation timeline
- Ask about their process
- Understand interim possibilities

### Negotiating Start Date

If clearance reactivation needed:
- Discuss realistic timelines
- Ask about uncleared work during processing
- Negotiate accordingly
- Get commitment on process speed

## If You've Already Lost Currency

### Options If Expired

If your investigation has expired:
- You'll need new investigation
- Focus on employers who sponsor
- Consider federal employment (often sponsor)
- Target entry-level cleared positions

### Getting Re-Cleared

Process for new clearance:
1. Get hired for position requiring clearance
2. Employer sponsors investigation
3. Complete SF-86 thoroughly
4. Cooperate with investigation
5. Wait for adjudication

**Timeline:** 6-18+ months depending on level

### Improving Your Chances

If seeking new clearance:
- Clean financial record
- No legal issues
- Stable lifestyle
- Strong references

## The Bottom Line

Maintaining your clearance after separation requires:
- **Understanding** your clearance status and timeline
- **Documentation** of investigation dates and types
- **Planning** to minimize gap in cleared employment
- **Protecting** your eligibility during any gap
- **Acting** before currency expires

Your clearance is valuable. Every month it remains current is a month you can still use it.

Don't let it expire. Don't jeopardize your eligibility. Plan your transition to preserve this asset.

**Your cleared future depends on actions you take now.**
