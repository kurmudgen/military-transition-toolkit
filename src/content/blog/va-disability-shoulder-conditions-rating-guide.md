# VA Disability Rating for Shoulder Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Shoulder conditions are among the most common VA disability claims, with ratings from **0% to 80%** depending on severity and which arm is affected. Ratings are higher for your **dominant arm** (major) versus non-dominant (minor). The most common ratings are **10-20%** for limitation of motion, but rotator cuff tears, instability, and severe limitations can earn higher ratings. Each shoulder is rated separately, so bilateral shoulder problems can significantly increase your total rating. The key to maximizing your rating is documenting range of motion limitations, especially **where pain begins**, not just maximum motion. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Shoulder Conditions and How Does Military Service Cause Them?

Shoulder conditions include a variety of injuries and degenerative changes affecting the shoulder joint, rotator cuff, and surrounding structures. The shoulder is particularly vulnerable to military service-related damage.

**Common shoulder conditions:**
- Rotator cuff tears (partial or complete)
- Shoulder impingement syndrome
- Labral tears (SLAP tears)
- Shoulder instability (recurrent dislocations/subluxations)
- Bursitis
- Tendinitis/tendinosis
- Osteoarthritis
- AC joint separation
- Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)

**Military causes:**

- **Carrying heavy loads**: Rucksacks, equipment, weapons
- **Overhead activities**: Loading vehicles, maintenance work
- **Repetitive movements**: Throwing, lifting, pushing
- **Direct trauma**: Falls, vehicle accidents, combat
- **Sports injuries**: Unit PT, mandatory sports
- **Specific MOS demands**: Infantry, artillery, mechanics, aircrew
- **Firing weapons**: Repetitive recoil, heavy weapon operation
- **Climbing**: Obstacles, vehicles, ships

## VA Rating Criteria for Shoulder Conditions

The VA rates shoulder conditions under multiple diagnostic codes in **38 CFR § 4.71a**. The rating depends on **which arm** (dominant = major, non-dominant = minor) and **specific impairment**.

### DC 5201 - Limitation of Motion of Arm

| Motion Level | Major (Dominant) | Minor (Non-Dominant) |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| At shoulder level (90°) | 20% | 20% |
| Midway between side and shoulder (45°) | 30% | 20% |
| To 25° from side | 40% | 30% |

**Note:** Normal shoulder flexion and abduction is 180°. This code rates how HIGH you can raise your arm.

### DC 5200 - Ankylosis of Scapulohumeral Articulation

| Position | Major | Minor |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Favorable (abduction to 60°, can reach mouth and head) | 30% | 20% |
| Intermediate (between favorable and unfavorable) | 40% | 30% |
| Unfavorable (abduction limited to 25° from side) | 50% | 40% |

**Note:** Ankylosis means the joint is frozen/immobile. This is for severe cases.

### DC 5202 - Other Impairment of Humerus

**Recurrent dislocation at scapulohumeral joint:**

| Frequency | Major | Minor |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Infrequent episodes, guarding of movement only at shoulder level | 20% | 20% |
| Frequent episodes and guarding of all arm movements | 30% | 20% |

**Malunion of humerus:**

| Severity | Major | Minor |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Moderate deformity | 20% | 20% |
| Marked deformity | 30% | 20% |

**Fibrous union of humerus:** 50% (major), 40% (minor)
**Nonunion of humerus (false flail joint):** 60% (major), 50% (minor)
**Loss of head of humerus (flail shoulder):** 80% (major), 70% (minor)

### DC 5203 - Impairment of Clavicle or Scapula

| Condition | Major | Minor |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Malunion | 10% | 10% |
| Nonunion without loose movement | 10% | 10% |
| Nonunion with loose movement | 20% | 20% |
| Dislocation | 20% | 20% |

### Understanding Shoulder Range of Motion

**Normal shoulder motion:**
- **Flexion**: 0-180° (raising arm forward and up)
- **Abduction**: 0-180° (raising arm to side and up)
- **External rotation**: 0-90°
- **Internal rotation**: 0-90°

**What the ratings mean practically:**
- **Can raise arm to shoulder level (90°)**: 20%
- **Can only raise arm halfway up (45°)**: 20-30%
- **Can barely lift arm from side (25°)**: 30-40%

### Painful Motion (38 CFR § 4.59)

Even if your range of motion doesn't technically meet the criteria, you can receive at least 10% for painful motion if you have:
- X-ray evidence of arthritis, AND
- Painful motion documented at examination

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**In-service documentation:**
- Service treatment records showing shoulder complaints, injuries, or treatment
- Physical profiles limiting lifting, overhead work, or PT
- Sick call visits for shoulder pain
- MRI, X-ray, or arthroscopy results from service
- Surgical records
- Line of duty determinations

**Circumstantial evidence:**
- MOS requiring heavy lifting or overhead work
- Deployment records
- Buddy statements about shared physical demands
- Fitness test score declines

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA C&P exam findings**
2. **Private orthopedic evaluation** with nexus statement
3. **Current imaging:**
   - X-ray showing arthritis, bone spurs, AC joint changes
   - MRI showing rotator cuff tears, labral damage
   - Ultrasound showing tendon pathology
4. **Physical examination findings:**
   - Range of motion measurements
   - Strength testing
   - Instability tests
   - Impingement signs

### Severity Evidence

1. **Medical records documenting:**
   - Ongoing treatment
   - Medications
   - Physical therapy
   - Injections (corticosteroid, PRP)
   - Surgical history

2. **Personal statement describing:**
   - Pain levels and patterns
   - Activities you can no longer do
   - Limitations at work
   - Flare-up frequency and severity
   - Use of slings or braces

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The shoulder C&P exam directly determines your rating through range of motion testing.

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about shoulder history and current symptoms
3. **Measure range of motion** (critical)
4. Test strength
5. Check for instability
6. Assess for impingement and rotator cuff integrity
7. Review imaging
8. Test repetitive motion (3 times)

**Range of Motion Testing:**

The examiner measures:
- **Flexion**: Raising arm forward
- **Abduction**: Raising arm to side
- **External rotation**: Rotating arm outward
- **Internal rotation**: Rotating arm inward

They should document:
- Where you stop moving
- Where pain begins
- Changes after repetitive motion
- Passive vs. active motion differences

**What to tell them:**

1. **Report where pain begins**: "I start feeling pain at about 70 degrees when raising my arm"
2. **Describe weakness**: "I can't lift more than 10 pounds overhead"
3. **Mention instability**: "My shoulder feels like it's going to pop out when I reach"
4. **Explain flare-ups**: "After using my arm a lot, I can barely move it the next day"
5. **Note all symptoms**: Pain, weakness, grinding, catching, popping
6. **Identify dominant arm**: Make sure the examiner knows which is your dominant arm

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Pushing through pain**: Stop at pain onset—that's what matters
- **Not identifying dominant arm**: Higher ratings for dominant arm
- **Forgetting overhead limitations**: Specifically describe overhead activity limits
- **Good day vs. bad day**: Describe your worst days
- **Not mentioning flare-ups**: These can support higher ratings

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Shoulder Conditions

Shoulder problems often lead to other issues:

1. **Cervical (Neck) Strain** - DC 5237
   - Compensating for shoulder causes neck problems
   - Same nerve roots involved
   - Can be secondary

2. **Radiculopathy (Upper Extremity)** - DC 8510-8512
   - Nerve symptoms radiating from neck to arm
   - Can be related to shoulder compensation

3. **Thoracic Outlet Syndrome**
   - Nerve and blood vessel compression
   - Related to shoulder mechanics

4. **Opposite Shoulder Condition**
   - Overcompensating with good shoulder
   - Claim aggravation

5. **Scars** - DC 7800-7805
   - From surgical repairs
   - Rated separately if painful or limiting

6. **Depression/Anxiety** - DC 9434, 9400
   - Chronic pain affects mental health
   - Loss of activities and function

7. **Elbow and Wrist Conditions**
   - Compensating for shoulder
   - Related kinetic chain issues

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "No current diagnosis"
**Why it happens:** Examination doesn't show pathology
**How to avoid:**
- Get MRI before filing showing tears or damage
- Obtain clear diagnosis from orthopedist

### 2. "No nexus to service"
**Why it happens:** Examiner attributes to aging or other causes
**How to avoid:**
- Document in-service injuries or demands
- Get buddy statements about physical requirements
- Obtain private nexus opinion

### 3. "Range of motion doesn't meet criteria"
**Why it happens:** Measured ROM at exam doesn't qualify for higher rating
**How to avoid:**
- Stop at pain onset, not maximum stretch
- Describe flare-ups and functional loss
- Request consideration of DeLuca factors (pain, fatigability)

### 4. "Dominant arm not documented"
**Why it happens:** Examiner didn't note or used wrong arm
**How to avoid:**
- Clearly state which arm is dominant
- Verify correct documentation at exam

### 5. "Pre-existing condition"
**Why it happens:** Shoulder problems before service
**How to avoid:**
- Argue aggravation during service
- Show worsening documented in records

## Buddy Statement Tips for Shoulder Conditions

**For fellow service members:**
- Describe physical demands you shared
- Injuries or complaints you witnessed
- Activities that required heavy shoulder use

**For family members:**
- Describe activities veteran can't do now
- Observations of pain and limitation
- Help needed with daily tasks
- Comparison to before service

**Example:**
"I am the spouse of [Veteran's Name]. I have observed their shoulder condition worsen over the years. They cannot reach overhead, and I must help them with [specific tasks—getting items from high shelves, putting on shirts, etc.]. They frequently complain of pain and take medication regularly. They have had to give up [activities—golf, swimming, etc.]. At night, they often wake due to shoulder pain. This is significantly different from when we first met [before/during their service], when they could [describe previous capability]."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** Examiner errors in ROM measurement, wrong dominant arm noted
**When to use:** If evidence supports claim but wasn't properly considered

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Adding new evidence
**What to submit:**
- New MRI showing damage
- Private orthopedic evaluation
- Independent Medical Opinion
- Updated ROM measurements during flare-up

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex cases or significant rating disputes
**When to use:** After HLR if still not satisfied

**Shoulder-specific appeal tips:**
- If ROM was close to threshold, argue painful motion and functional loss
- Request examiner specifically address DeLuca factors
- Get evaluation during a flare-up
- Challenge if both limitation AND instability weren't considered separately
- Verify correct documentation of dominant vs. non-dominant arm

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does it matter which arm is affected?
Yes. Your dominant arm (major) receives higher ratings than your non-dominant arm (minor) under most codes. Make sure the examiner correctly documents which arm is dominant.

### Can I claim both shoulders?
Absolutely. Each shoulder is rated separately. If both are affected by service, claim both.

### What if I had rotator cuff surgery?
Surgical repair doesn't prevent a rating. You're rated on your residual symptoms after surgery. You may also claim scars from the surgery.

### Can I get separate ratings for different shoulder problems?
Potentially. Different impairments (limitation of motion vs. instability) may warrant separate ratings, similar to knee conditions. However, this is less established than for knees.

### What if my shoulder is worse on some days?
Describe your flare-ups in detail. The VA must consider your functional loss during flare-ups, not just your best days.

### Should I claim my shoulder as "arthritis" or "rotator cuff tear"?
Describe your actual diagnosis. The VA will assign appropriate diagnostic codes. Having imaging evidence (MRI showing tears, X-ray showing arthritis) strengthens your claim regardless of how you label it.
