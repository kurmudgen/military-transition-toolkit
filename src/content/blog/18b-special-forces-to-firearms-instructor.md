**Obstacle #2: "Startup costs for training business seem high"**
**Solution:** Start mobile (lowest overhead). Teach at existing ranges. Build revenue before investing in facility. Many successful instructors operate mobile-only.

**Obstacle #3: "I don't have NRA instructor certs yet"**
**Solution:** Get them quickly ($1,000-$2,000, one week total). These are foundational. Many employers hire you and send you to NRA courses as part of onboarding.

**Obstacle #4: "Concerned about liability teaching firearms"**
**Solution:** Proper liability insurance ($1,500-$4,000/year) covers you. Solid safety protocols, waivers, and professional conduct minimize risk. Industry standard practices well-established.

**Obstacle #5: "Worried about income stability"**
**Solution:** Federal/state academy jobs offer stable salaries and benefits. Own business can be volatile first 1-2 years but stabilizes with reputation. Contractor work offers highest pay but requires flexibility.
