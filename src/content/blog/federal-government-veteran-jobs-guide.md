## Why Federal Employment for Veterans?

## Veterans Preference Explained

### Types of Veterans Preference

**5-Point Preference (TP):**
- Served on active duty during specified period
- Honorable discharge
- Adds 5 points to passing examination score

**10-Point Preference (Various Types):**

- **XP (Other 10-Point)**: Purple Heart, derived preference
- Adds 10 points to passing examination score
- Additional protections in hiring

### How Veterans Preference Works

**For Competitive Service Positions:**
1. You apply and are rated against other candidates
2. If you score in the "Best Qualified" range, preference is applied
3. Veterans are placed ahead of non-veterans with the same score
4. 10-point preference veterans are placed ahead of 5-point

**Important**: Veterans preference only applies after you're determined "qualified" for the position. You still need to meet basic qualifications.

### Derived Preference

**For Spouses/Family Members:**
- Spouse of 100% disabled veteran
- Widow/widower of veteran
- Mother of deceased/disabled veteran
- May qualify for 10-point preference
