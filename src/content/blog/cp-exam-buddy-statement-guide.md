# Buddy Statements for VA Claims: How to Write One That Helps (2025)

A buddy statement—also called a lay statement or statement in support of claim—is one of the most powerful yet underused tools in VA disability claims. The right buddy statement can make the difference between approval and denial, especially when official records are incomplete.

This guide covers how to write buddy statements that actually help.

## What Is a Buddy Statement?

A buddy statement is a written statement from someone who has witnessed your condition or the events related to it. This can be:

- **Fellow service members** (the traditional "buddy")
- **Spouse or partner**
- **Family members**
- **Coworkers**
- **Friends**
- **Anyone with firsthand knowledge**

### Legal Status

Buddy statements are considered "lay evidence"—testimony from non-medical professionals. Under VA law, lay evidence is valid and must be considered in rating decisions.

The VA recognizes that:
- Not everything is documented in official records
- Witnesses can speak to observable facts
- Personal accounts have evidentiary value

## When Buddy Statements Matter Most

### 1. Service Connection Without Records

If your service treatment records don't document an injury or condition, buddy statements can fill the gap.

**Example:** You hurt your knee during training but didn't go to sick call. A fellow service member can state: "I witnessed [Veteran] injure his knee during [training exercise] on [approximate date]."

### 2. In-Service Symptoms

For conditions like PTSD or sleep apnea where diagnosis came later, buddy statements can prove symptoms existed during service.

**Example:** Bunkmates describing your snoring and breathing stops during sleep in service can support a sleep apnea claim.

### 3. Continuity of Symptoms

Buddy statements can bridge the gap between service and current condition.

**Example:** Family members describing continuous symptoms from discharge to present.

### 4. Current Severity

Spouses and family see your daily struggles. Their observations carry weight.

**Example:** "Since returning from deployment, my husband has nightmares 3-4 times per week and wakes up screaming."

### 5. Behavior Changes

Observable changes in behavior support mental health claims.

**Example:** "Before deployment, [Veteran] was outgoing and social. After, they became withdrawn and isolated."

## Who Should Write Buddy Statements

### For In-Service Events
- Fellow service members who witnessed the event
- Anyone who served with you during relevant time
- Military supervisors who knew about your condition

### For Current Symptoms
- Spouse/partner (most valuable—they see everything)
- Adult children
- Parents if they observe you regularly
- Close friends
- Coworkers who observe limitations

### For Continuous Symptoms Over Time
- Long-term spouse or partner
- Parents
- Siblings
- Long-time friends

## What Makes a Strong Buddy Statement

### 1. Be Specific, Not General

**Weak:** "John has back pain."
**Strong:** "I have witnessed John struggle to stand up from his chair at least 5 times during our weekly dinners. He grimaces and has to use the table to push himself up. This has been happening for the past 3 years."

### 2. Include Dates and Timeframes

**Weak:** "Jane used to be happy."
**Strong:** "Before Jane's deployment to Iraq in 2015, she was outgoing and enjoyed family gatherings. After she returned in 2016, she stopped attending events and refuses to be in crowded places. This change happened immediately after her return and has continued since."

### 3. Describe What You Personally Witnessed

Use phrases like:
- "I personally observed..."
- "I witnessed..."
- "I saw firsthand..."
- "I was present when..."

Don't write about things you only heard about secondhand.

### 4. Explain Your Relationship and Opportunity to Observe

**Include:**
- How you know the veteran
- How long you've known them
- How often you interact with them
- Why you're in a position to observe their condition

### 5. Address Specific Symptoms

For PTSD claims, mention:
- Nightmares (how often? what happens?)
- Hypervigilance (specific behaviors)
- Isolation (compared to before)
- Anger outbursts (specific incidents)

For physical conditions:
- Specific limitations you've observed
- Activities they can't do anymore
- How often symptoms occur
- Severity you've witnessed

## Examples by Condition Type

### PTSD Buddy Statement Example

"I am the wife of [Veteran]. We have been married since 2010.

Since my husband returned from Afghanistan in 2012, I have personally witnessed the following symptoms:

**Nightmares:** He has nightmares 4-5 nights per week. He thrashes, screams, and sometimes throws punches in his sleep. I was hit in the face once when I tried to wake him. This has not improved in 10 years.

**Hypervigilance:** He refuses to sit with his back to the door in restaurants. He scans every room we enter and identifies exits. Last month, a car backfired at the grocery store and he dropped to the ground. He was embarrassed but said he couldn't help it.

**Anger:** Before deployment, he never raised his voice. Now, small things set him off. Last week, our son left dishes in the sink and my husband yelled for 20 minutes. He put a hole in the wall twice in the past year.

**Social isolation:** Before deployment, we had friends over regularly and attended his unit's events. He hasn't been to a unit event since 2012. We've lost contact with most friends because he refuses to go anywhere.

**Before and after:** When I married him in 2010, he was charming, calm, and loved being around people. The man who came back from Afghanistan is constantly on edge, avoids everyone, and struggles every day."

### Back Pain Buddy Statement Example

"I am [Veteran's] coworker at [Company]. I have worked with him for 5 years in the warehouse.

I have personally observed [Veteran] struggle with his back condition:

**Mobility:** I have seen him unable to bend down to pick up items from low shelves. He has to kneel or ask someone else to get items. This happens multiple times per shift.

**Pain:** He grimaces and holds his lower back after standing for more than 15-20 minutes. I've seen him take breaks to sit down several times per day.

**Missed work:** In the past year, he has called out sick at least once per month, telling me it's because his back is 'locked up.' When he comes back, he moves even more slowly.

**Limitations:** Before his back got bad, he could lift boxes up to 50 pounds like everyone else. Now he's limited to light duty and can't lift more than about 20 pounds. He was passed over for a promotion last year because of these limitations."

### Sleep Apnea Buddy Statement (In-Service Snoring)

"I served with [Veteran] in [Unit] at [Base] from 2005-2008. We shared a barracks room for approximately 18 months.

During this time, I personally witnessed the following:

**Snoring:** [Veteran] snored extremely loudly every night. Other soldiers in our barracks complained constantly. I wore earplugs but could still hear him through the wall.

**Breathing stops:** On multiple occasions, I observed [Veteran] stop breathing during sleep and then gasp or choke. This was alarming—I thought something was wrong with him. Other roommates witnessed this too.

**Daytime fatigue:** Despite sleeping 8+ hours, [Veteran] was always exhausted. He fell asleep during classes and briefings. Our NCO counseled him multiple times for seeming inattentive.

At the time, none of us knew about sleep apnea. We just thought he was a heavy snorer. Looking back, these were clearly symptoms of sleep apnea that existed during his military service."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Being Too Vague
**Wrong:** "He has PTSD symptoms."
**Right:** "He has nightmares about 4 nights per week where he wakes up screaming."

### 2. Overstating What You Know
**Wrong:** "I know his back injury occurred on March 15, 2008."
**Right:** "I witnessed him injure his back during training in approximately March 2008."

### 3. Medical Diagnoses
Don't diagnose conditions. Describe what you observe.
**Wrong:** "His PTSD is severe."
**Right:** "His symptoms include [specific observable behaviors]."

### 4. Copying the Veteran's Statement
Write in your own words. Identical statements look coordinated.

### 5. Failing to Sign and Date
An unsigned statement is much weaker. Include full signature, date, and contact information.

## How to Submit Buddy Statements

### With Initial Claim
Include with your VA Form 21-526EZ and other evidence.

### With Supplemental Claim
Add new buddy statements as new evidence.

### Before C&P Exam
Ensure statements are in your file before the examiner reviews your case.

### Upload Methods
- VA.gov claim upload
- Mail to VA regional office
- Through your VSO

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many buddy statements should I have?
Quality over quantity. 2-3 strong, specific statements are better than 10 vague ones.

### Can family members write buddy statements?
Yes. Spouses and family members are often the best observers of daily symptoms.

### Do buddy statements have to be notarized?
No. A signature is sufficient, though notarization adds formality.

### Can buddy statements alone prove service connection?
Sometimes. Combined with other evidence, they can establish service connection even without medical records.

### What if I can't find my military buddies?
Use family members, spouse, coworkers—anyone who can speak to your condition.

### Can I write a buddy statement for myself?
That's called a personal statement, not a buddy statement. You should write one too, but it's different from third-party observations.

Key points:
- Be specific with dates, examples, and observations
