## Understanding Shoulder Condition VA Ratings

Shoulder conditions are rated under 38 CFR § 4.71a, primarily using Diagnostic Code 5201 (Arm, limitation of motion). Ratings are based on range of motion limitations, pain on motion, weakness, and functional impairment.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown (DC 5201)

Shoulder ratings are based on limited range of motion at the shoulder level:

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** Shoulder or arm motion at shoulder level limited to 25 degrees from side.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Can raise arm to about 25 degrees (very limited elevation)
- Significant limitation in overhead activities
- Difficulty with many daily tasks
- Pain with movement
- Can still use arm but with major restrictions

**Monthly:** $171.23

#### 20% Rating
**Criteria:** Shoulder or arm motion at shoulder level limited to 45 degrees from side.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Can raise arm to about 45 degrees (limited to less than horizontal)
- Cannot reach overhead
- Difficulty with most reaching activities
- Major functional limitations
- Significant pain

**Monthly:** $333.01

**Common Rating** for moderate shoulder conditions.

#### 30% Rating
**Criteria:** Shoulder or arm motion at shoulder level limited to 90 degrees (horizontal).

**What This Looks Like:**
- Can raise arm to horizontal but no higher
- Cannot reach above shoulder level
- Difficulty with overhead activities
- Can perform some tasks but with limitations
- Regular pain and stiffness

**Monthly:** $524.31

**Most Common Rating** for service-connected shoulder conditions with significant impairment.

#### 40% Rating
**Criteria:** Shoulder or arm motion at shoulder level limited between 90 and 180 degrees (limited from horizontal toward vertical).

**What This Looks Like:**
- Can raise arm above horizontal but not fully overhead
- Moderate limitation in reaching
- Some functional impairment
- Pain with elevation

**Monthly:** $755.28

#### 50% Rating
**Criteria:** Ankylosis (complete immobility) of shoulder in favorable position.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Shoulder essentially frozen in good position for function
- Cannot move shoulder through normal range
- Significant disability despite favorable position

**Monthly:** $1,075.16

#### 60% Rating
**Criteria:** Ankylosis of shoulder in unfavorable position.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Shoulder frozen in position that severely impairs function
- Major disability

**Monthly:** $1,361.88

## Important: Alternative Rating Methods

### Painful Motion (38 CFR § 4.59)

**Critical:** If shoulder movement is accompanied by pain, the minimum compensable rating is 10%, **even if range of motion measurements don't meet the criteria**.

**What This Means:**
- If you have pain during shoulder movement
- Even if you can achieve full range of motion through the pain
- Minimum 10% rating

**This is often overlooked but very important.**

### Functional Loss (38 CFR § 4.40)

**Alternative Rating Method:**
If ROM measurements don't fully capture functional loss, VA can rate based on:
- Loss of function
- Weakness
- Fatigability
- Poor endurance
- Inability to perform tasks

**Example:** Rotator cuff tear with significant weakness preventing lifting, even if ROM measurements don't support higher rating.

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Medical Diagnosis and Imaging

**Required:**
- Medical records documenting shoulder condition
- Orthopedic evaluation

**Imaging:**
- **X-rays:** Show arthritis, bone spurs, fractures, AC joint problems
- **MRI:** Best for rotator cuff tears, labral tears, soft tissue
- **Ultrasound:** Can show rotator cuff tears
- **CT scan:** Bone detail, sometimes used

**Diagnosis Should Include:**
- Specific condition (rotator cuff tear, arthritis, etc.)
- Which shoulder (left, right, or bilateral)
- Severity
- Treatment provided/recommended

### 2. Range of Motion Measurements - CRITICAL

**Shoulder ROM:**
- **Forward elevation (flexion):** Normal 180 degrees
- **Abduction (raising to side):** Normal 180 degrees
- **External rotation:** Normal 90 degrees
- **Internal rotation:** Normal reaching to T6-T8 vertebrae (mid-back)

**How ROM Measured:**
- Goniometer
- Measured by physician, PA, or physical therapist
- Active ROM (you move it) most important
- Passive ROM (examiner moves it) also documented

**Important Angles for Ratings:**
- 25 degrees from side = 10%
- 45 degrees from side = 20%
- 90 degrees (horizontal) = 30%
- Between 90-180 degrees = 40%

**Pain on Motion:**
- Pain during ROM testing can limit functional ROM
- Minimum 10% for painful motion even if ROM is good

**Weakness:**
- Reduced strength from rotator cuff tear
- Functional limitation beyond ROM measurements
- Can support higher rating or alternative rating method

### 3. Functional Impact Documentation

**Employment:**
- Job requirements (overhead work, lifting, reaching)
- Work limitations due to shoulder
- Reduced hours or job loss
- Accommodations needed (can't lift over X pounds)

**Daily Life:**
- Difficulty with overhead activities (shelves, cabinets)
- Dressing difficulties (shirt, coat)
- Grooming difficulties (hair, back)
- Household tasks affected
- Sports/activities given up
- Driving difficulty
- Sleep disturbance from shoulder pain

**Specific Examples:**
- Cannot reach into backseat of car
- Cannot put dishes away in upper cabinets
- Cannot wash back or put on bra
- Cannot throw ball with child
- Cannot perform job duties

### 4. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Shoulder injury during service
- Service medical records documenting injury
- Continuity of symptoms from service to present

**Common Service Injuries:**
- Falls, training accidents
- Vehicle accidents
- Heavy lifting, load carrying
- Repetitive overhead activities
- Combat injuries
- Sports injuries during service

**Secondary Service Connection:**
- Shoulder condition secondary to another service-connected condition:
  - **Neck condition:** Cervical radiculopathy affecting shoulder
  - **TBI:** Fall or injury mechanism that also injured shoulder
  - **Compensation:** Altered mechanics from another injury

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing shoulder condition worsened by service

### 5. Nexus Opinion

Medical opinion linking shoulder condition to service or service-connected condition.

**Strong Nexus Includes:**
- Review of service records showing injury
- Review of imaging and current condition
- Medical explanation of connection
- Timeline supporting connection
- "At least as likely as not" statement

**Example Nexus:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's right shoulder rotator cuff tear is related to military service. Service records document a fall from a height during training in 2010 with shoulder injury. Current MRI shows full-thickness rotator cuff tear. The mechanism of injury and temporal relationship support service connection."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability for shoulder pain even if I can move it?
Yes. If you have pain during shoulder movement, you qualify for minimum 10% rating under the painful motion provision (38 CFR § 4.59), even if ROM measurements are good.

### What ROM measurement qualifies for 30%?
Shoulder motion limited to 90 degrees (horizontal/shoulder level) from the side. This means you can raise your arm to horizontal but no higher.

### Do I need an MRI to get a shoulder rating?
Not absolutely required, but very helpful for diagnosing rotator cuff tears, labral tears, and soft tissue problems. X-rays can show arthritis. Better imaging = better documentation.

### Will VA reduce my shoulder rating if I get surgery?
Not automatically. Often surgery reveals worse damage than expected or leaves residual symptoms, resulting in same or higher ratings. Don't avoid needed surgery for fear of rating reduction.

### Can shoulder problems be secondary to neck conditions?
Yes. Cervical radiculopathy (nerve compression in neck) can cause shoulder pain and weakness. Can be rated as both neck condition and shoulder condition if distinct.

### What if I have weakness but good ROM?
Use functional loss provision (38 CFR § 4.40). Weakness preventing lifting and functional activities can warrant rating even if ROM is good. Document weakness and functional limitations thoroughly.

### Can I get separate ratings for multiple shoulder conditions?
Generally no. The shoulder is rated as a whole under the condition producing the greatest limitation (pyramiding rules). However, some combinations may be rateable separately (e.g., nerve damage plus joint condition).

### What if I have arthritis in both shoulders?
File for both. Each shoulder is rated separately, then combined with a bilateral factor, often resulting in a higher combined rating.

### How important is my job for the rating?
Functional impact matters. If your job requires overhead work and your shoulder prevents this, document it. However, rating is primarily based on ROM and pain, not job-specific factors.

### Can I get TDIU for shoulder conditions?
Possibly. If shoulder problems (combined with other conditions) prevent substantially gainful employment, you may qualify for TDIU. Requires one condition at 60% or combined 70% with one at 40%.

### What if my shoulder "catches" or "pops"?
Document these symptoms. May indicate labral tear, rotator cuff problem, or instability. Get imaging (MRI) to diagnose. These symptoms support functional impairment.

### Should I mention night pain?
Yes. Shoulder pain at night (especially from rotator cuff problems) is common and significantly impacts quality of life. Document sleep disturbance.

### Can shoulder conditions cause neck problems?
Yes. Biomechanical relationships mean shoulder problems can affect neck and vice versa. Both should be evaluated and potentially rated.

### What if I can't lift my arm at all?
This would likely be more than 30% rating. May be 40% if between 90-180 degrees, or 50% if ankylosis. Get comprehensive evaluation including strength testing and ROM.

## Final Thoughts

Shoulder conditions are among the most common musculoskeletal disabilities affecting veterans. Repetitive overhead work, heavy lifting, training injuries, and combat trauma all take a toll on shoulders.

**Keys to a Successful Shoulder Claim:**

1. **Get comprehensive evaluation** - Imaging, ROM, orthopedic exam
2. **Document functional impact** - Specific examples of limitations
3. **Understand painful motion** - Minimum 10% even with good ROM if painful
4. **Establish service connection** - Injury during service or secondary to another condition
5. **File for both shoulders** - If both affected, bilateral claims rate higher
6. **Consider weakness** - Functional loss can support rating beyond ROM measurements
7. **Update as condition worsens** - Arthritis and old injuries progress over time

Shoulder problems significantly impact ability to work and perform daily activities. If your shoulder condition is related to your military service, you deserve compensation.

**File your claim. Protect your shoulders. Get the benefits you earned.**
