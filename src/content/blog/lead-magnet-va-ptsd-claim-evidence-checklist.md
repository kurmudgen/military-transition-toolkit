## INTRODUCTION

### Why I Created This Guide

I'm currently navigating my own VA disability claims process, and PTSD is one of the most misunderstood and improperly filed conditions. I've seen too many deserving veterans get denied—not because they don't have PTSD, but because they didn't provide the right evidence in the right format.

The VA isn't going to do the work for you. They need specific evidence presented in specific ways. This guide gives you the exact roadmap.

### The Challenge with PTSD Claims

PTSD claims are uniquely challenging because:

1. **The trauma is in the past** - often years or decades ago
2. **Symptoms are internal** - not visible like a physical injury
3. **Records may be incomplete** - especially for combat veterans
4. **The VA uses strict criteria** - miss one element and you're denied

But here's the good news: **PTSD is one of the most common service-connected disabilities.** The VA approves thousands of PTSD claims every month. You just need to give them what they're looking for.

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Read Chapter 1** to understand exactly what the VA requires
2. **Work through Chapters 2-6** to gather each type of evidence
3. **Use Chapter 7** to prepare for your C&P exam
4. **Follow Chapter 8's checklist** to ensure you have everything before filing

This isn't a quick process. Plan for 3-6 months to gather proper evidence. But the difference between a denied claim and a 70% rating is worth the time.

## CHAPTER 1: Understanding VA PTSD Claims (The 4 Required Elements)

### Overview

The VA will NOT approve your PTSD claim unless you provide evidence for ALL FOUR of these elements:

1. **Stressor Event** (the traumatic event occurred in service)
2. **Current Diagnosis** (you have PTSD right now)
3. **Nexus** (your current PTSD is connected to the service stressor)
4. **Symptoms** (evidence of how PTSD affects you)

**Miss even ONE element = Claim Denied**

Let's break down each requirement.

---

### ELEMENT #1: STRESSOR EVENT

**What the VA Wants to Know:**
"Did a traumatic event actually occur during your military service?"

**Why This Matters:**
The VA must verify that you experienced a qualifying traumatic stressor while in service. They don't just take your word for it.

**Types of Qualifying Stressors:**

**Combat-Related Stressors** (Easiest to Prove)
- Direct combat engagement
- IED attacks or explosions
- Being fired upon
- Witnessing casualties
- Handling human remains
- Experiencing mortar/rocket attacks

**Non-Combat Stressors** (Require More Evidence)
- Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
- Physical assault
- Accidents or disasters
- Threat of injury or death
- Witnessing violence or death

**Evidence Required:**
- **Combat stressors:** Often your DD-214 showing deployment to combat zone is sufficient
- **Non-combat stressors:** Require incident reports, medical records, or buddy statements

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you served in a combat zone, the VA presumes you experienced combat stressors. This makes approval much easier.

---

### ELEMENT #2: CURRENT DIAGNOSIS

**What the VA Wants to Know:**
"Do you currently have PTSD diagnosed by a qualified professional?"

**Why This Matters:**
You must have an actual PTSD diagnosis from a psychiatrist, psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker. Self-diagnosis doesn't count.

**What Qualifies:**

✅ **Diagnosis from:**
- VA psychiatrist or psychologist
- Private psychiatrist or psychologist
- Licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)
- Military mental health provider

✅ **Diagnosis must:**
- Be based on DSM-5 criteria for PTSD
- Be current (within last 2 years preferred)
- Include diagnostic codes
- List specific symptoms

❌ **Does NOT Qualify:**
- Self-diagnosis
- Diagnosis from primary care doctor only (not mental health specialist)
- Diagnosis of "anxiety" or "depression" without PTSD
- Decades-old diagnosis with no current treatment

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you haven't been formally diagnosed, schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist or psychologist NOW. Get the diagnosis before filing your claim.

---

### ELEMENT #3: NEXUS

**What the VA Wants to Know:**
"Is your current PTSD connected to the service stressor?"

**Why This Matters:**
You could have PTSD from a car accident last year. The VA needs evidence that your PTSD is **caused by or related to** your military service, not other life events.

**How to Prove Nexus:**

**Best Evidence:**
- **Nexus letter** from treating psychiatrist/psychologist stating PTSD is "at least as likely as not" related to service stressor

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Timeline showing symptoms began during or shortly after service
- No other traumatic events that could explain PTSD
- Treatment records linking symptoms to service events

**Nexus Statement Language:**
The magic words the VA wants to see:

> "It is at least as likely as not that [Veteran's Name]'s current diagnosis of PTSD is related to the in-service stressor of [specific event]."

This meets the VA's burden of proof standard (50% or greater probability).

💡 **Pro Tip:** A strong nexus letter is often the difference between approval and denial. We'll cover exactly how to get one in Chapter 4.

---

### ELEMENT #4: SYMPTOMS (For Rating Purposes)

**What the VA Wants to Know:**
"How severely does PTSD affect your daily life and functioning?"

**Why This Matters:**
This determines your disability rating (0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%) and therefore your monthly compensation.

**Evidence of Symptoms:**
- Your own testimony (DBQ form, personal statement)
- Lay statements from spouse, family, friends
- Treatment records showing symptoms
- Work performance issues
- Social/relationship problems
- Daily living difficulties

We'll cover how to document symptoms for maximum rating in Chapter 5.

---

### The VA Rating Scale for PTSD

| Rating | Monthly Compensation (2025) | Symptom Severity |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------|
| 0% | $0 | Diagnosed but no functional impairment |
| 10% | $171 | Mild symptoms, minimal impairment |
| 30% | $524 | Occasional symptoms, some impairment |
| 50% | $1,075 | Moderate symptoms, significant impairment |
| 70% | $1,716 | Severe symptoms, major impairment |
| 100% | $3,737 | Total occupational and social impairment |

**The difference between 50% and 70% is $641/month = $7,692/year.**

Proper symptom documentation is worth tens of thousands of dollars.

---

### Common Reasons PTSD Claims Get Denied

❌ **Insufficient Stressor Evidence**
- Claiming combat trauma but no deployment records
- Non-combat stressor with no supporting documentation

❌ **No Current Diagnosis**
- Filing before getting formally diagnosed
- Diagnosis from non-qualified provider

❌ **Missing Nexus**
- No medical opinion connecting PTSD to service
- Weak nexus letter not meeting "at least as likely as not" standard

❌ **Understating Symptoms**
- Being "tough" at C&P exam and downplaying symptoms
- No documentation of how PTSD affects daily life

❌ **Incomplete Application**
- Missing forms or evidence
- Not submitting buddy statements
- Vague personal statement

**All of these are preventable with proper preparation.**

### ✓ ACTION ITEMS: Understanding Requirements

□ Identify your specific service stressor (combat or non-combat)
□ Determine what evidence exists for your stressor
□ Check if you have current PTSD diagnosis (if not, schedule appointment)
□ Understand what nexus evidence you'll need
□ Begin documenting your symptoms

---

## CHAPTER 2: Stressor Evidence - Proving Your Trauma

### Overview

The VA must verify your stressor actually occurred. The evidence you need depends on whether it was combat-related or non-combat.

### COMBAT STRESSORS (Easiest to Prove)

#### What Qualifies as Combat

✅ Serving in combat zone during wartime
✅ Direct enemy engagement
✅ Indirect fire (mortars, rockets, IEDs)
✅ Witnessing casualties or death
✅ Handling remains
✅ Convoys or patrols in hostile areas

#### Evidence That Proves Combat Service

**Tier 1 Evidence (Strongest):**

✅ **DD-214 showing:**
- Deployment to combat zone
- Combat service medals (Combat Infantryman Badge, Combat Action Badge, Combat Action Ribbon)
- Campaign medals (Iraq Campaign Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal)
- Dates of service during wartime

✅ **Unit Records showing:**
- Deployment orders
- Combat zone assignment
- Unit citations

**This is often enough.** If your DD-214 shows combat deployment, the VA generally accepts you experienced combat stressors.

**Tier 2 Evidence (Supporting):**

✅ Orders assigning you to combat unit
✅ Awards for valor or combat service
✅ Photos from deployment (with context)
✅ News articles about unit operations
✅ Official unit histories

**You don't need to prove every specific incident.** The VA presumes combat veterans experienced stressors.

#### Personal Statement for Combat PTSD

Even with strong DD-214 evidence, write a personal statement describing:
- Where you deployed and when
- General nature of combat exposure (firefights, IEDs, casualties)
- Specific incidents that affected you most (if you're comfortable sharing)
- When symptoms began

**Example:**

> "I deployed to Afghanistan from June 2012 to March 2013 with 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Our unit conducted daily patrols in Sangin District, one of the most hostile areas in Helmand Province. During my deployment, I experienced approximately 15-20 IED explosions, multiple firefights, and witnessed three members of my platoon killed in action. One incident on November 3, 2012, particularly affected me when..."

You don't need to write a novel. 1-2 pages is sufficient.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Be specific about locations and timeframes, but you don't have to relive every traumatic detail in your personal statement. The C&P examiner will ask for details.

---

### NON-COMBAT STRESSORS (Require More Evidence)

#### What Qualifies as Non-Combat Stressors

✅ Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
✅ Physical assault
✅ Training accidents
✅ Witnessing death or serious injury (non-combat)
✅ Motor vehicle accidents
✅ Natural disasters during service
✅ Credible threats of harm

#### Evidence Required for Non-Combat Stressors

Non-combat stressors require **corroboration** - you need evidence beyond just your statement.

**Direct Evidence (Strongest):**
✅ Medical records from time of incident
✅ Law enforcement or command investigation reports
✅ Safety investigation reports (for accidents)
✅ Counseling records
✅ Emergency room visit records

**Corroborating Evidence (When Direct Evidence Doesn't Exist):**
✅ Buddy statements from witnesses
✅ Personnel records showing behavioral changes after event
✅ Performance reviews showing decline
✅ Records of disciplinary issues after event
✅ Evidence of transfer requests or job changes

#### Special Rules for Military Sexual Trauma (MST)

The VA recognizes that MST often goes unreported, so they allow **markers** as evidence:

**Behavioral Markers:**
✅ Requests for transfers or change in assignment
✅ Decline in work performance
✅ Increased sick calls or medical visits
✅ Substance abuse incidents
✅ Episodes of depression, panic, or anxiety
✅ Unexplained economic or social changes
✅ Sexual dysfunction diagnosis

**Other MST Evidence:**
✅ Statements from roommates, friends, family about behavior changes
✅ Pregnancy tests or STD treatment records
✅ Any documentation of reporting (even if not formal complaint)

💡 **Pro Tip for MST:** Even without a formal report, evidence of behavior changes around the time of assault can establish the stressor.

---

### HOW TO OBTAIN STRESSOR EVIDENCE

#### 1. Request Your Military Personnel Records

**What to Request:**
- Complete military personnel file (OMPF)
- Medical records
- Unit assignment records
- Deployment records

**How to Request:**
- **eVetRecs:** https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records
- **National Personnel Records Center**
- **Turnaround:** 2-4 weeks (up to 6 months for older records)

💡 **Start this process EARLY.** It takes time.

#### 2. Request Unit Records

If your incident involved your entire unit (combat, accident, etc.):
- Contact unit historian
- Request deployment records
- Request unit after-action reports

#### 3. Search News Archives

For significant events:
- Google news archives
- Military Times archives
- Local news from deployment area
- Unit Facebook pages or veteran groups

#### 4. FOIA Requests (If Needed)

If records aren't in your personnel file:
- File Freedom of Information Act request
- Specify: incident reports, safety investigations, law enforcement reports
- **Timeline:** 60-90 days

---

### ✓ ACTION ITEMS: Gathering Stressor Evidence

**Week 1:**
□ Identify your specific stressor (combat or non-combat)
□ Request complete military records from NPRC
□ Draft personal statement describing stressor

**Week 2:**
□ Gather any records you already have (orders, photos, DD-214)
□ Search for news articles about your unit or incident
□ Contact unit members who can provide buddy statements

**Week 3:**
□ File FOIA requests if needed for specific incidents
□ Follow up on military records request

### What a Proper PTSD Diagnosis Report Must Include

Your diagnosis report should include:

✅ **Provider Credentials**
- Full name and credentials (MD, PhD, PsyD, LCSW)
- License number
- Date of evaluation

✅ **Clinical Interview Summary**
- Your reported symptoms
- Stressor discussed
- When symptoms began

✅ **DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria Met**
The report should reference DSM-5 criteria for PTSD and confirm you meet them:
- Criterion A: Exposure to traumatic event ✓
- Criterion B: Intrusion symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares) ✓
- Criterion C: Avoidance ✓
- Criterion D: Negative alterations in cognition/mood ✓
- Criterion E: Arousal and reactivity ✓
- Duration > 1 month ✓
- Functional impairment ✓

✅ **Formal Diagnosis**
Clear statement: "Patient meets DSM-5 criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)"

✅ **Diagnostic Code**
ICD-10 code: F43.10 (Post-traumatic stress disorder)

✅ **Onset Timeline**
"Symptoms began approximately [timeframe] after military service stressor in [year]"

---

### What If You Were Diagnosed Years Ago?

**If you have old diagnosis but no recent treatment:**
- Get **current evaluation** confirming PTSD still present
- VA wants to know you have PTSD **now**, not just that you had it years ago

**If you've been in ongoing treatment:**
- Request records from last 2 years
- Most recent diagnosis is acceptable
- Ongoing treatment records actually strengthen claim

---

### Treatment Records as Supporting Evidence

**Why Treatment Records Help:**

1. **Confirm ongoing PTSD** (not just old diagnosis)
2. **Document symptoms** over time
3. **Show functional impairment** (work issues, relationship problems mentioned in therapy notes)
4. **Demonstrate attempts to manage condition**

**What to Request from Your Provider:**
✅ Diagnosis letter
✅ Treatment summaries (last 6-12 months)
✅ Therapy notes mentioning symptoms (if provider willing to share)
✅ Medication records

💡 **Pro Tip:** You don't need years of treatment to file a claim. Even 2-3 months of treatment provides valuable evidence.

---

### What If You've Never Sought Treatment?

**Many veterans haven't sought treatment due to:**
- Stigma
- Toughness mentality
- Not realizing symptoms were PTSD
- Lack of access to mental health care

**This doesn't disqualify you.** But you need to:

1. **Get diagnosed NOW** before filing
2. **Explain the delay** in your personal statement

**Example Statement:**

> "For 10 years after my deployment, I did not seek mental health treatment. I believed seeking help was a sign of weakness, and I tried to manage my symptoms on my own through alcohol and isolation. It wasn't until my wife threatened to leave due to my anger and withdrawal that I finally sought help in 2023. I was diagnosed with PTSD in March 2024."

The VA understands delayed treatment for PTSD is common among veterans.

---

### ✓ ACTION ITEMS: Getting Your Diagnosis

**Option A: VA Healthcare**
□ Enroll in VA healthcare (if not enrolled)
□ Call (877) 222-8387 to schedule mental health appointment
□ Attend appointment and request PTSD evaluation
