# VA Disability Rating for Kidney Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Kidney conditions are rated under various diagnostic codes (DC 7500-7542) with ratings from **0% to 100%** depending on severity and functional impairment. Chronic kidney disease is rated based on **renal dysfunction** criteria. Kidney conditions are commonly claimed as **secondary** to diabetes (diabetic nephropathy), hypertension, or toxic exposures. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## Common Kidney Conditions

- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Diabetic nephropathy
- Hypertensive nephropathy
- Nephritis
- Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis)
- Polycystic kidney disease
- Kidney injury from toxic exposures

## VA Rating Criteria

### Renal Dysfunction (General)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Albumin and casts with history of acute nephritis; or hypertension non-compensable under DC 7101 |
| **30%** | Albumin constant or recurring with hyaline and granular casts or red blood cells; OR transient or slight edema or hypertension at least 10% under DC 7101 |
| **60%** | Constant albuminuria with some edema; OR definite decrease in kidney function; OR hypertension at least 40% under DC 7101 |
| **80%** | Persistent edema and albuminuria with BUN 40-80mg%; OR creatinine 4-8mg%; OR generalized poor health characterized by lethargy, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, or limitation of exertion |
| **100%** | Requiring regular dialysis, OR precluding more than sedentary activity from one of the following: persistent edema and albuminuria; OR BUN more than 80mg%; OR creatinine more than 8mg%; OR markedly decreased function of kidney or other organ systems, especially cardiovascular |

### Kidney Stones (DC 7508)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Occasional attacks of colic, not infected and not requiring catheter drainage |
| **20%** | Recurring stone formation requiring diet therapy, drug therapy, or invasive or non-invasive procedures more than two times per year |
| **30%** | Frequent attacks of colic with infection (pyonephrosis), kidney function impaired |

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing kidney issues
- Environmental exposure records (toxins, chemicals)
- Documentation supporting secondary connection to diabetes or hypertension

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Nephrology evaluation
- Lab results (BUN, creatinine, GFR, urinalysis)
- Imaging (ultrasound, CT)

### Severity Evidence
- Serial lab results showing progression
- Dialysis records (if applicable)
- Treatment records

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review lab results
2. Assess kidney function (GFR, BUN, creatinine)
3. Check for edema, albumin in urine
4. Evaluate impact on daily activities

**Bring documentation of:**
- Most recent lab results
- Dialysis schedule (if applicable)
- All kidney-related medications

## Secondary Conditions

**Kidney disease commonly secondary to:**
- Diabetes mellitus (diabetic nephropathy)
- Hypertension (hypertensive nephropathy)
- Medications (NSAIDs, etc.)
- Toxic exposures

**Kidney disease can cause:**
- Hypertension
- Anemia
- Bone disease
- Cardiovascular problems

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim kidney disease secondary to diabetes?
Yes. Diabetic nephropathy is a recognized complication of diabetes. Document declining kidney function after diabetes diagnosis.

### How does GFR affect my rating?
Lower GFR indicates worse kidney function. Combined with other criteria (BUN, creatinine, symptoms), this determines your rating level.

### What if I'm on dialysis?
Dialysis supports 100% rating for renal dysfunction.
