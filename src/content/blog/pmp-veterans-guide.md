## What Is PMP Certification?

PMP (Project Management Professional) is the gold standard certification for project managers worldwide. Issued by the Project Management Institute (PMI), it validates your ability to lead projects, manage teams, and deliver results using proven project management methodologies.

The PMP certification demonstrates competence across three domains: People (42%), Process (50%), and Business Environment (8%). It covers predictive (waterfall), agile, and hybrid project management approaches.

## Why Veterans Excel in Project Management

Military experience IS project management experience:

**Mission planning:** Every military operation is a project with scope, timeline, resources, and stakeholders. You've been managing projects your entire career.

**Leadership under pressure:** PMs must lead cross-functional teams through challenges. You've led teams in far more stressful conditions.

**Resource management:** Military leaders constantly balance limited resources against mission requirements—the core PM skill.

**Risk management:** Identifying threats, assessing probability and impact, developing mitigation strategies—military planning does this daily.

**Stakeholder management:** Coordinating with higher headquarters, adjacent units, and external partners mirrors civilian stakeholder management.
