## The Complete Guide to Claiming Conditions Caused by Your Service-Connected Disabilities
**By Jacob, Navy E6 | Formation Labs**

## WHAT ARE SECONDARY CONDITIONS?

Secondary conditions are disabilities caused or aggravated by your already service-connected conditions. They can DRAMATICALLY increase your VA rating and monthly compensation.

**Example:** You have 10% rating for right knee pain. Years of favoring your right knee causes left knee and lower back problems. **Those are secondary conditions worth additional ratings.**

## WHY SECONDARY CONDITIONS MATTER

**Most veterans leave money on the table by not claiming secondaries.**

**Example Scenario:**
- **Primary only:** 40% rating = $755/month
- **With secondaries:** 70% rating = $1,716/month
- **Difference:** $961/month = **$11,532/year**

**Over 20 years: $230,640 difference**

## TOP 20 SECONDARY CONDITIONS

### 1. SLEEP APNEA (Secondary to PTSD, Anxiety, Depression)

**Connection:** Mental health conditions → weight gain, disrupted sleep → sleep apnea
**Rating:** 0%, 30%, 50%, or 100%
**50% rating = $1,075/month**

**Required Evidence:**
- Sleep study showing apnea
- Nexus letter linking to mental health condition
- Evidence of weight gain or sleep disruption from primary condition

### 2. LOWER BACK PAIN (Secondary to Knee, Hip, Ankle Injuries)

**Connection:** Compensating for leg injury → abnormal gait → back strain
**Rating:** 10%-100% (10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 100%)
**40% rating = $755/month**

**Required Evidence:**
- Imaging (X-ray, MRI) showing back issues
- Medical evidence of gait abnormality
- Nexus letter connecting back pain to compensating for leg injury

### 3. KNEE PAIN (Secondary to Opposite Knee, Hip, or Back)

**Connection:** Favoring one leg → overuse of other knee
**Rating:** 0%-30% per knee
**10% per knee = $171/month each**

**Required Evidence:**
- Exam showing limited range of motion
- Documentation of favoring opposite side
- Nexus letter

### 4. DEPRESSION/ANXIETY (Secondary to Chronic Pain, Tinnitus, PTSD)

**Connection:** Chronic physical conditions → mental health decline
**Rating:** 0%-100%
**70% = $1,716/month**

**Required Evidence:**
- Mental health diagnosis (psychiatrist/psychologist)
- Treatment records
- Nexus letter connecting to physical condition

### 5. RADICULOPATHY (Secondary to Back or Neck Conditions)

**Connection:** Spine condition → nerve compression → radiating pain
**Rating:** 10%-80% per affected nerve
**Multiple nerves can be rated separately**

**Required Evidence:**
- EMG/nerve conduction study
- Physical exam showing numbness/tingling
- Connection to primary spine condition

### 6. MIGRAINES (Secondary to Neck Pain, TBI, PTSD)

**Connection:** Neck injury/TBI/stress → migraine headaches
**Rating:** 0%, 30%, or 50%
**50% = $1,075/month**

**Required Evidence:**
- Headache log (frequency and severity)
- Medical diagnosis
- Nexus to primary condition

### 7. SHOULDER PAIN (Secondary to Neck Injury)

**Connection:** Neck injury → referred pain to shoulder
**Rating:** 0%-40% per shoulder
**20% per shoulder = $284/month each**

### 8. HIP PAIN (Secondary to Back or Opposite Hip)

**Connection:** Back pain → gait changes → hip strain
**Rating:** 0%-60% per hip

### 9. ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION (Secondary to Diabetes, PTSD, Medications)

**Connection:** Diabetes damages blood vessels, PTSD medications cause ED
**Rating:** 0% with SMC-K ($112/month) or rated under mental health

### 10. HYPERTENSION (Secondary to PTSD, Anxiety, Sleep Apnea)

**Connection:** Stress conditions → elevated blood pressure
**Rating:** 10%, 20%, 40%, or 60%
**10% = $171/month**

### 11-20. OTHER COMMON SECONDARIES

**11. Plantar Fasciitis** (secondary to knee/back issues - gait changes)
**12. Carpal Tunnel** (secondary to neck injury - nerve compression)
**13. TMJ** (secondary to PTSD - teeth grinding/jaw clenching)
**14. GERD** (secondary to PTSD medications or stress)
**15. IBS** (secondary to PTSD, anxiety)
**16. Sciatica** (secondary to back conditions)
**17. Tinnitus Worsening** (secondary to TBI, stress)
**18. Obesity** (secondary to immobility from injuries)
**19. Peripheral Neuropathy** (secondary to diabetes)
**20. Respiratory Issues** (secondary to burn pit exposure causing sleep apnea)

## SECONDARY CONDITION CHAINS

### KNEE INJURY CHAIN:
Right Knee (primary 10%)
→ Left Knee (secondary 10%)
→ Lower Back (secondary 20%)
→ Hip Pain (secondary 10%)
**Combined: 44% rating = $859/month**

### PTSD CHAIN:
PTSD (primary 70%)
→ Sleep Apnea (secondary 50%)
→ Depression (already part of PTSD rating)
→ IBS (secondary 10%)
→ Migraines (secondary 30%)
**Combined: Can reach 100% = $3,737/month**

### TBI CHAIN:
TBI (primary 10-70%)
→ Migraines (secondary 30-50%)
→ Cognitive issues (may increase TBI rating)
→ Sleep disturbance (secondary 0-10%)
→ Tinnitus (secondary 10%)

## HOW TO CLAIM SECONDARY CONDITIONS

### STEP 1: Identify Potential Secondaries

Review this list and consider:
□ What conditions have developed since your service-connected injury?
□ What body parts have you started compensating with?
□ What mental health issues emerged from chronic pain?
□ What medication side effects have you experienced?

### STEP 2: Get Medical Evidence

□ See doctor for new condition
□ Get formal diagnosis
□ Document in medical records
□ Request imaging/testing if needed

### STEP 3: Obtain Nexus Letter

Your doctor must write: "It is at least as likely as not that [secondary condition] is caused by or aggravated by [primary service-connected condition]."

### STEP 4: File Secondary Claim

□ VA Form 21-526EZ (Supplemental Claim)
□ Check box for "secondary to [primary condition]"
□ Submit nexus letter
□ Submit medical evidence

### STEP 5: Attend C&P Exam

Be prepared to explain:
- How primary condition led to secondary
- Timeline of secondary condition development
- Current symptoms of secondary condition
