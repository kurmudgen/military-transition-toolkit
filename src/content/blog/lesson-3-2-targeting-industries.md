### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Lesson 3.2 - Targeting Different Industries]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome back! Your resume is now ATS-optimized. But here's a truth that many veterans miss: one resume doesn't fit all jobs.

**[ON SCREEN: "One Resume ≠ All Industries"]**

A resume that works for a Fortune 500 corporate job will fail for a federal government position. A tech startup resume looks completely different from a healthcare resume.

In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to customize your military resume for five major industry sectors: Corporate/Business, Federal/Government, Technology/Startups, Healthcare, and Defense Contractors.

You'll learn what each industry values, how to structure your resume differently, and what keywords and formatting they expect.

Let's make sure your resume speaks the language of your target industry.

### PART 1: CORPORATE/FORTUNE 500 RESUMES (0:30-3:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Corporate & Fortune 500 Companies"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let's start with corporate and Fortune 500 companies - this is where most transitioning veterans end up.

**WHAT CORPORATE EMPLOYERS VALUE:**

**[ON SCREEN: Corporate values list]**

1. **Leadership and management experience**
2. **Quantifiable business results** (revenue, cost savings, efficiency)
3. **Team collaboration and cross-functional work**
4. **Process improvement and optimization**
5. **Adaptability and change management**

**RESUME STRUCTURE FOR CORPORATE:**

**LENGTH:** 1-2 pages maximum (lean toward 1 page for E5-E6)

**SECTIONS (in order):**
1. Header (contact info)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 sentences highlighting leadership and business value)
3. Core Skills (12-15 keywords, business-focused)
4. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Education
6. Certifications (optional)

**[ON SCREEN: Corporate Keywords]**

**KEYWORDS TO EMPHASIZE:**
- Leadership: Managed, Directed, Supervised, Led, Coordinated
- Business results: Increased efficiency, Reduced costs, Improved performance
- Collaboration: Cross-functional, Stakeholder, Partnership, Team
- Project management: Delivered, Executed, Completed, Achieved
- Common corporate buzzwords: Strategic planning, Change management, Process improvement, KPI (Key Performance Indicators), ROI (Return on Investment)

**[ON SCREEN: Before/After Example - Corporate Resume]**

**MILITARY VERSION:**
"Squad leader for 12-soldier infantry squad conducting combat operations in Afghanistan"

**CORPORATE VERSION:**
"Team Leader managing 12-person unit in high-pressure environment, coordinating cross-functional operations and delivering 100% mission success rate over 12-month project period"

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Notice: We eliminated "infantry," "soldiers," and "Afghanistan." We added "high-pressure environment," "cross-functional," and "project period" - all corporate language.

**FORMATTING TIPS FOR CORPORATE:**
- Clean, professional design
- Standard fonts (Calibri, Arial, Garamond)
- Plenty of white space
- Bold job titles
- Clear section headers
- Subtle use of color is okay (navy, dark gray) but not required

### PART 2: FEDERAL/GOVERNMENT RESUMES (USAJOBS) (3:30-6:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Federal/Government Resumes (USAJobs)"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Federal resumes are completely different animals. If you apply to federal jobs using a corporate resume, you'll be automatically disqualified.

**WHAT FEDERAL EMPLOYERS VALUE:**

**[ON SCREEN: Federal values list]**

1. **Detailed documentation of duties and responsibilities**
2. **Exact dates and hours worked**
3. **Supervisor contact information**
4. **Veteran preference points**
5. **KSAs** (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities) addressed in narrative form

**RESUME STRUCTURE FOR FEDERAL:**

**LENGTH:** 3-5 pages (yes, really - federal resumes are LONG)

**SECTIONS (in order):**
1. Contact Information (full address, phone, email, citizenship)
2. Veteran Preference Information
3. Professional Summary (can be longer, 1 paragraph)
4. Work Experience (DETAILED format - see below)
5. Education (include all transcripts, coursework)
6. Certifications and Training
7. Awards and Recognition
8. Other Information (languages, clearances, etc.)

**[ON SCREEN: Federal Work Experience Format]**

**FEDERAL WORK EXPERIENCE FORMAT:**

**JOB TITLE:** Operations Manager
**EMPLOYER:** U.S. Army, Fort Bragg, NC
**EMPLOYMENT DATES:** June 2018 - Present
**HOURS PER WEEK:** 40+ hours
**SUPERVISOR:** MSG John Smith, (910) 555-1234, okay to contact

**DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:**

[Then 10-15 detailed bullet points describing everything you did, using full sentences]

**INSTRUCTOR:**
See the difference? Federal resumes require:
- Exact months and years
- Hours per week
- Supervisor name and contact info
- Permission to contact
- Much more detail in the duties section

**[ON SCREEN: Federal Keywords]**

**KEYWORDS TO EMPHASIZE:**
- Use exact language from the job announcement
- Compliance, Regulatory, Policy, Procedures
- Federal terminology: GS scale awareness, OMB, GAO, etc.
- Security clearances prominently featured
- Awards and commendations (federal loves awards)

**CRITICAL FEDERAL RESUME TIPS:**

1. **Address the KSAs** - If the posting lists KSAs or specialized experience requirements, address each one explicitly in your resume
2. **Don't leave gaps** - Account for every month of your work history
3. **Include everything** - Federal wants more detail, not less
4. **Military service counts** - Each duty station/assignment can be a separate "job"
5. **Veteran preference** - Make your veteran status VERY clear at the top

**[ON SCREEN: "Federal Resume = Detailed Record, Not Marketing Document"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Remember: corporate resumes are marketing documents (concise, impactful). Federal resumes are comprehensive records (detailed, complete). Two different philosophies.
