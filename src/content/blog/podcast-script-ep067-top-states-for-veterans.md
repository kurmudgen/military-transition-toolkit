[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

What if I told you that the state you choose to live in after the military could be worth tens of thousands of dollars in benefits every single year? I'm not talking about your VA disability or retirement pay—I'm talking about state-level benefits that stack on top of your federal benefits. In 2025, the difference between living in the best state for veterans versus an average state could mean the difference between paying $8,000 a year in property taxes or paying zero. Between paying state income tax on your retirement pay or keeping every dollar. Between paying $30,000 for your kid's college or getting it completely free.

This is Jacob, your host on the Veteran Transition Blueprint podcast. I'm a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're breaking down the top 5 states for veteran benefits—comparing Texas, Florida, Alaska, Illinois, and California across every category that actually matters: income taxes, property taxes, education benefits, healthcare access, and overall cost of living. By the end of this episode, you'll know exactly which states offer the most value for your situation, and more importantly, how to calculate what these benefits are actually worth to you and your family.

Let's get into it.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Segment 1: Understanding the State Benefits Landscape - Why Location Matters**

Before we dive into specific states, you need to understand something critical: state-level veteran benefits can actually be worth MORE than some of your federal benefits over the long term.

Here's what I mean. Let's say you're a veteran with a 100% VA disability rating living in Texas. Your federal VA compensation is $3,737.85 per month in 2025—that's the same no matter where you live. But in Texas:

- You pay ZERO state income tax on your VA compensation (saving you about $300-400/month compared to states with income tax)
- You get a FULL property tax exemption on your home (saving you $500-800/month depending on your home value)
- Your kids can get 150 credit hours of FREE college tuition through the Hazelwood Act (worth $60,000-100,000 total)

Add that up: you're potentially saving $10,000-15,000 per year just from state benefits, PLUS getting six-figure education benefits. Over 20 years of retirement, that's $200,000-300,000 in additional value.

Now compare that to living in a state like California, where you'll pay state income tax on any earned income, property taxes can run $6,000-10,000 annually even with veteran exemptions, and state education benefits are limited.

So when you're deciding where to live after the military, you're not just choosing a zip code—you're making a six-figure financial decision.

The five states we're covering today—Texas, Florida, Alaska, Illinois, and California—represent the most popular destinations for veterans in 2025. Texas and Florida consistently rank #1 and #2 for overall veteran benefits. Alaska offers some of the most generous property tax breaks in the nation. Illinois recently overhauled its veteran tax laws to become significantly more competitive. And California, despite higher costs, has the largest veteran population and most extensive VA healthcare network in the country.

Let's break down exactly what each state offers.

---

**Segment 2: Texas - The #1 State for Veteran Benefits in 2025**

Texas has earned its reputation as the best state for veterans, and it's not even close. Here's why:

**Income Tax: ZERO**

Texas has no state income tax. Period. Your VA disability compensation, your military retirement pay, your survivor benefit plan payments—all tax-free at the state level. If you're a military retiree pulling in $30,000 per year in retirement pay, you're keeping an extra $1,500-2,000 annually compared to states with income tax.

**Property Tax: FULL EXEMPTION for Disabled Veterans**

This is where Texas really shines. If you have a 100% VA disability rating (including TDIU), you get a COMPLETE property tax exemption on your primary residence. No limit. You could own a $500,000 home and pay ZERO property taxes.

Here's the breakdown:
- 10-29% disability rating: $5,000 assessed value exemption
- 30-49% disability rating: $7,500 assessed value exemption
- 50-69% disability rating: $10,000 assessed value exemption
- 70-100% disability rating or TDIU: FULL exemption on primary residence

The average property tax bill in Texas is about $4,000-5,000 per year. If you're at 100%, you're saving that entire amount. Over 20 years, that's $80,000-100,000 in savings.

**Education Benefits: The Hazelwood Act**

This is arguably the most valuable state education benefit in the entire country. The Hazlewood Act provides up to 150 credit hours of tuition-free education at Texas public colleges and universities to:

- Honorably discharged Texas veterans who entered the service as a Texas resident
- Eligible dependents (spouse or children) if the veteran is deceased, missing in action, or totally disabled

150 credit hours is enough for a bachelor's degree PLUS most of a master's degree. At the University of Texas at Austin, in-state tuition is about $11,000 per year. That's $44,000-55,000 in value for a four-year degree, and if you transfer it to your kids, you can cover multiple children up to the 150-hour limit.

**Additional Benefits:**

- Veterans with 60%+ disability rating: FREE driver's license
- Free hunting and fishing licenses for 50%+ disabled veterans
- Veterans Land Board loans: discounted land, home, and home improvement loans
- Free license plates for Purple Heart recipients and former POWs

**Real-World Example:**

Meet Sarah, a Marine Corps veteran with an 80% VA rating who moved to San Antonio in 2023. Before Texas, she lived in Virginia where she paid:
- $350/month in property taxes
- About $200/month in state income tax on her part-time work
- Planning to spend $40,000 on her daughter's college

In Texas:
- Property taxes: $0 (full exemption)
- State income tax: $0
- Daughter's college: $0 (Hazelwood Act transfer)

Sarah is saving approximately $6,600 per year in taxes alone, PLUS $40,000 in education costs. That's a $66,000+ swing over the next 10 years.

**The Bottom Line on Texas:**

For veterans with ANY disability rating (even 10%), Texas offers measurable financial benefits. For veterans rated 70-100%, Texas is virtually unbeatable. The only downside? Property taxes for non-disabled veterans are relatively high, and the summer heat is no joke.

---

**Segment 3: Florida - The #2 State with Unbeatable Tax Benefits**

Florida runs a very close second to Texas, and for some veterans, it might actually be the better choice. Here's what Florida offers:

**Income Tax: ZERO**

Just like Texas, Florida has no state income tax. Your VA disability, military retirement, and survivor benefits are all state tax-free.

**Property Tax: Strong Exemptions for Disabled Veterans**

Florida's property tax exemptions are excellent, though structured differently than Texas:

- 10% or higher disability rating: Additional $5,000 homestead exemption
- 100% permanent and total disability: COMPLETE exemption from property taxes on homestead property

If you're rated at 50% and your home is assessed at $300,000, you're getting an additional $5,000 off your assessed value, saving you about $100-150 per year. Not huge, but combined with Florida's standard homestead exemption (first $25,000-50,000), it adds up.

If you're at 100% permanent and total (P&T), you pay ZERO property taxes on your primary residence—just like Texas.

**Education Benefits: Florida GI Bill and Congressional Bill Young Tuition Waiver**

Florida offers TWO major education programs:

1. **Congressman C.W. Bill Young Florida Veterans Tuition Waiver Program**: Provides 110% of tuition and fees waived at Florida public colleges and universities for honorably discharged veterans who have lived in Florida for at least one year after separation.

2. **Florida GI Bill**: Provides 100% tuition and fees waived at Florida public colleges and universities for veterans who served on or after September 11, 2001, and received an honorable discharge.

These programs don't cover housing or books like the federal Post-9/11 GI Bill, but they allow you to SAVE your federal GI Bill for graduate school or transfer it to your kids while still getting free undergraduate education.

At the University of Florida, in-state tuition is about $6,380 per year. That's $25,520 in value for a four-year degree.

**Healthcare Access:**

Florida has 10 VA Medical Centers and over 60 community-based outpatient clinics. Major facilities include:
- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa (one of the largest VA hospitals in the country)
- Miami VA Healthcare System
- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center

Florida also has a massive veteran population (over 1.5 million), which means extensive veteran support networks, VSO offices, and military-friendly employers.

**Additional Benefits:**

- Free hunting and fishing licenses for disabled veterans
- Free state park entry for 100% disabled veterans
- Driver's license fee waiver for Purple Heart recipients
- Veteran preference in state hiring
- In-state tuition rates for out-of-state veterans attending Florida schools

**Real-World Example:**

Mike, an Army E7 who retired at 20 years, moved to Jacksonville in 2024. His military retirement pay is $36,000 per year. He's rated 70% disabled by the VA.

In North Carolina (where he was stationed), he paid:
- About $1,800/year in state income tax on retirement pay
- $2,400/year in property taxes (with a small veteran reduction)

In Florida:
- State income tax: $0
- Property taxes: $2,200/year (with the $5,000 homestead exemption plus standard exemptions)

Mike is saving about $2,000 per year, and when he hits 100% P&T (he has pending secondary conditions), his property taxes will drop to zero, saving him another $2,200 annually.

**The Bottom Line on Florida:**

Florida is nearly identical to Texas for tax benefits and offers strong education benefits. The deciding factors often come down to: climate preference (humidity vs. dry heat), job market in your field, and proximity to family. Florida's Gulf Coast is particularly popular with veterans for its lower cost of living compared to South Florida.

**Segment 4: Alaska, Illinois, and California - The Dark Horses**

Let me quickly break down three other states that offer significant but different benefits:

**Alaska: Extreme Property Tax Benefits**

Alaska might be #3 on my list despite the harsh climate because of one incredible benefit:

- **Property Tax Exemption**: Veterans with a 50% or higher disability rating receive a $150,000 property value exemption. In Anchorage, where property tax rates are about 1.2%, this saves you $1,800 per year automatically.

Alaska also has NO state income tax and NO sales tax (though some municipalities have local sales taxes).

But Alaska also offers the **Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD)**: every Alaska resident, including veterans, receives an annual dividend from the state's oil revenues. In 2024, the PFD was $1,312 per person. For a family of four, that's $5,248 per year in free money just for living there.

**Additional benefits:**
- Free lifetime hunting and fishing licenses for veterans
- Veteran preference in state hiring
- Strong VA healthcare at the Alaska VA Healthcare System in Anchorage

**The catch?** Cost of living in Alaska is 25-30% higher than the national average, and the winter darkness is real (Anchorage gets about 5.5 hours of daylight in December).

**Illinois: New Tax Benefits as of 2024**

Illinois completely overhauled its veteran tax laws in 2024, making it significantly more competitive:

**Income Tax Benefits (NEW):**
- ALL military retirement pay and Survivor Benefit Plan payments: 100% tax-free starting in tax year 2024
- Active duty military pay: 100% tax-free
- National Guard and Reserve pay: 100% tax-free

Prior to 2024, only the first $5,000 was exempt. Now, if you're receiving $40,000 per year in military retirement, you save about $2,000 annually in state income taxes.

**Property Tax Benefits:**
- Standard Homestead Exemption for veterans
- Disabled Veterans' Standard Homestead Exemption: an annual $5,000 reduction in property taxes for veterans with at least 30% service-connected disability
- Returning Veterans' Homestead Exemption: $5,000 reduction for veterans who served during wartime and returned to Illinois

**Education Benefits:**
- Illinois Veteran Grant (IVG): covers tuition and mandatory fees at Illinois public universities and community colleges for veterans who served at least one year of active duty and were Illinois residents upon entering service

**Why consider Illinois?**
- Major job markets in Chicago and suburbs
- Strong union presence and veteran hiring programs
- Excellent VA healthcare (Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago, Hines VA Hospital)
- Lower cost of living than coastal states (outside Chicago)

**California: Volume Over Percentage**

California doesn't offer the tax breaks of Texas or Florida—you WILL pay state income tax (up to 13.3% for high earners), and property taxes are based on purchase price with limited exemptions.

BUT California has:

**Healthcare Access**: Over 100 VA healthcare facilities, including major medical centers in Los Angeles, San Diego, Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Long Beach. If you have complex medical needs, California's VA healthcare network is unmatched.

**Property Tax Benefits**:
- Disabled Veterans' Exemption: up to $230,330 in assessed value exemption for veterans with service-connected disabilities (as of 2024-25)
- Veterans with 100% disability: full property tax exemption

**Education Benefits**:
- Cal Vet Fee Waiver: covers tuition and fees at California State Universities and community colleges for veteran dependents (not as generous as Texas or Florida for veterans themselves)

**Job Market**: California has the largest economy of any state, with major opportunities in tech (San Francisco Bay Area), defense contracting (San Diego), aerospace (Los Angeles), and entertainment.

**The Bottom Line**: California makes sense if you have significant healthcare needs, work in an industry with limited opportunities elsewhere (tech, entertainment), or prioritize proximity to family. The higher taxes are offset somewhat by strong salaries and VA healthcare access, but you'll pay more to live there than Texas or Florida.

**Segment 5: How to Choose the Right State for YOU - Decision Framework**

Here's my tactical framework for choosing where to live after the military:

**Step 1: Calculate Your Actual Tax Savings**

Pull up a spreadsheet and calculate:
- Your annual state income tax in your current state vs. potential move states
- Your estimated property tax (look up median property taxes in specific cities)
- Compare apples to apples: $300,000 home in Austin vs. $300,000 home in Tampa vs. $300,000 home in Sacramento

Use this formula:
```
Annual Tax Savings = (Current State Income Tax + Current Property Tax) - (New State Income Tax + New Property Tax)
```

**Step 2: Factor in Education Benefits**

If you have kids who will attend college in the next 10-15 years:
- Texas Hazelwood Act: ~$60,000-100,000 value
- Florida tuition waivers: ~$25,000-35,000 value
- California/Illinois benefits: ~$20,000-30,000 value

Add this to your tax savings calculation.

**Step 3: Consider Healthcare Needs**

If you have complex, ongoing medical needs (especially service-connected), prioritize states with:
- Major VA Medical Centers (not just clinics)
- Proximity to VA facilities (within 30-45 minutes)
- Strong Community Care networks

Texas, Florida, and California dominate here. Alaska and Illinois have good facilities in Anchorage and Chicago but limited options in rural areas.

**Step 4: Job Market Reality Check**

Don't move for benefits if you can't find work. Research:
- Major employers in your field in target cities
- Average salaries (use Glassdoor, Salary.com, Bureau of Labor Statistics)
- Veteran hiring programs and preferences

For example:
- Tech jobs: California, Texas (Austin), Washington
- Defense contracting: Virginia, California (San Diego), Texas, Florida
- Healthcare: everywhere, but especially Texas and Florida (aging populations)
- Skilled trades: Texas, Florida (construction booms)

**Step 5: Factor in Cost of Living**

Use a cost of living calculator to compare cities. Housing costs can cancel out tax savings if you're not careful.

Example: A $300,000 home in San Antonio might be equivalent to a $450,000 home in San Diego in terms of property taxes, but your overall expenses will be WAY lower in San Antonio.

**Step 6: Visit Before You Move**

Seriously. Spend a week in your target city during the WORST weather season:
- Texas in August (100°F+ heat, humidity)
- Florida in September (hurricane season, humidity)
- Alaska in January (darkness, cold)

If you can't handle the climate, no amount of tax savings will make you happy.

---

**Segment 7: Action Steps - Making Your Move**

If you've decided to relocate for veteran benefits, here's the tactical timeline:

**6-12 Months Before Move:**

1. **Research specific cities and neighborhoods**: Don't just pick a state—pick a city and neighborhood. Use:
   - Zillow/Realtor.com for housing costs
   - GreatSchools.org if you have kids
   - City-Data.com for crime stats and demographics
   - Local veteran Facebook groups for real-world insights

2. **Get Pre-Approved for VA Home Loan**: Even if you're not buying immediately, know your budget

3. **Research employers and apply for jobs**: Start applying 3-4 months before your move date

4. **Plan your move**: Get quotes from moving companies (look for military/veteran discounts), plan driving route if moving yourself

**1-3 Months Before Move:**

1. **Update your address with VA**: Use the VA.gov website to change your address for disability compensation, healthcare, and education benefits

2. **Transfer your driver's license**: Once you arrive, you'll need to get a new license (check if you qualify for free license in your new state)

3. **Register to vote**: Establish residency immediately

4. **File homestead exemption and veteran property tax exemption**: These are NOT automatic—you must apply with your county appraisal district or assessor's office within the specified timeframe (often within one year of moving)

**After the Move:**

1. **Enroll in local VA healthcare**: Transfer your VA healthcare to the nearest facility

2. **Connect with local VSOs**: American Legion, VFW, DAV—get plugged into the veteran community

3. **Research education benefits**: If you have kids, apply for state education benefits as soon as you establish residency

4. **File your first state tax return correctly**: Some states require you to file even if you owe nothing (to establish residency and exemption status)

[CONCLUSION]

Let's bring this home. Choosing where to live after the military is one of the biggest financial decisions you'll make. The difference between the best states for veterans and average states can be worth $10,000-20,000 per year in tax savings alone, plus five- to six-figure education benefits.

Texas is the clear #1 for most veterans, especially those with 70-100% disability ratings—zero income tax, full property tax exemption, and the Hazelwood Act make it unbeatable. Florida is a very close #2 with nearly identical tax benefits and excellent education waivers. Alaska offers extreme property tax breaks and the PFD. Illinois recently became competitive with new tax exemptions on military retirement. And California offers the best VA healthcare network and job market, though you'll pay for it in taxes.

The key is running YOUR numbers based on YOUR disability rating, YOUR family situation, and YOUR career field. Don't just follow the crowd—calculate the actual value of state benefits for your situation, factor in cost of living and job opportunities, and visit before you commit.

If you're currently living in a state that's costing you thousands of dollars per year in taxes, this might be the push you need to make a strategic move. Your state-level benefits are worth real money—claim them.

Resources for this episode, state-by-state benefit breakdowns, and a downloadable comparison spreadsheet are all available at militarytransitiontoolkit.com. Next episode, we're going deep on state property tax exemptions for disabled veterans, including how to apply and what documentation you need.

Until next time—this is Jacob. Take care of each other out there.
