## Bottom Line Up Front

**Aid and Attendance (A&A) and Housebound benefits provide substantial additional monthly payments** for veterans unable to care for themselves or leave home.

Veterans rated 50%+ with medical evidence of care needs or housebound status qualify. Processing time 60-120 days; approval rates 70-80% with proper documentation. These benefits significantly increase veterans' compensation, particularly for those with severe PTSD, TBI, or physical disabilities requiring care.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Insufficient Specific Documentation
**Mistake:** Vague statement "I need help" without specific examples.

**Fix:** Specific examples: "Cannot bathe self safely," "Cannot leave home due to severe panic attacks," "Require help dressing/grooming daily."

### 2. Weak Physician Statements
**Mistake:** Generic doctor note without specific A&A/Housebound support.

**Fix:** Request specific statement for A&A or Housebound claim, not just functional limitation note.

### 3. No Current Documentation
**Mistake:** Old medical records without current evidence.

**Fix:** Gather recent medical records (within 3-6 months) showing ongoing needs.

### 4. Lack of Corroboration
**Mistake:** Personal statement only, no family or provider corroboration.

**Fix:** Include family statement describing limitations and care provided.

### 5. Below 50% Rating
**Mistake:** Trying to claim A&A/Housebound without 50%+ rating.

**Fix:** These benefits require 50%+ rating. If below, first increase rating to 50%+.
