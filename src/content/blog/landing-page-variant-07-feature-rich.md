## FAQ Section

### Question 1: Is this really ALL-IN-ONE or just marketing talk?
It's genuinely comprehensive. We've built career tools, state benefits databases, VA resources, financial calculators, resume builders, document storage, and more. You won't find a more complete veteran transition platform anywhere.

### Question 2: With so many features, is it overwhelming to use?
No. The dashboard organizes everything by category. You use what you need when you need it. If you only care about state benefits today, go there. Need career stuff next week? It's waiting. You don't have to use everything at once.

### Question 3: Are all features included or is there premium stuff?
All features are included in every membership tier. No premium upsells, no "pro version," no hidden features. You get everything.

### Question 4: How often do you add new features?
We add features based on user requests. Recently added: state comparison tool, transition cost estimator, and TAP supplement guide. More coming based on what veterans tell us they need.

### Question 5: Can I suggest features you don't have?
Absolutely. Email support@militarytransitiontoolkit.com with your idea. If enough veterans need it, we'll build it. This platform is built for the community, by the community.

### Question 6: Do I need to use all features to get value?
No. Some users only use 2-3 features. Others use everything. Even if you only use the state benefits guides ($15K average value found), it pays for itself 60x over. Use what you need—it's all included.

### Question 7: How do features get updated?
We monitor for changes (state benefit updates, BAH rate changes, etc.) and update quarterly or immediately for major changes. You always get current information, not outdated data from 2019.

## A/B Test Hypothesis

### What We're Testing
**Primary:** Does showcasing comprehensive features convert better than pain points, benefits, or other angles?

**Secondary:** Do detailed feature descriptions build confidence and reduce purchase hesitation?

**Tertiary:** Does "all features included" positioning justify the price better than other approaches?

### Expected Winner
**Moderate confidence—performance will vary by audience segment.**

**Will perform well with:**
- **Research-oriented users** who want to understand exactly what they're getting
- **High-detail personalities** (common among officers and senior enlisted)
- **Comparison shoppers** evaluating multiple transition resources
- **Users who value "complete solution"** over single-feature tools

**May underperform with:**
- **Decision-fatigued users** who find feature lists overwhelming
- **Emotional decision-makers** who need story/trust first
- **Mobile users** (long page, lots of detail)

**Prediction:** Middle-tier performer (5th-7th place) for general audience, but will be #1-2 for certain segments (officers, analytical personalities, comparison shoppers).

### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Free trial sign-up rate (target: 10-12%)
- **Secondary:** Time on page (expect highest of all variants—lots to read)
- **Engagement:** Screenshot views (lightbox clicks), feature accordion expansions
- **Quality:** Trial-to-paid conversion (expect higher—users who convert from this page know exactly what they're buying, less buyer's remorse)
- **Segment performance:** Track by referral source (hypothesis: paid search comparison traffic will love this)

### Statistical Significance Needed
- Minimum 300 visitors per variant (higher volume needed due to detail)
- 95% confidence level
- Run for 14+ days (longer page = more time needed to evaluate)
- Segment by traffic source and device (hypothesis: desktop will outperform mobile for this variant)
- Track engagement metrics: scroll depth, screenshot views, accordion expansions

## Mobile Optimization Notes

### Critical Elements
1. **Hero:** Show 3-6 top features (vs all 20+). Link to "See All Features" below.
2. **Core Features:** Accordion-style collapsed sections. Tap to expand each category.
3. **Screenshots:** Swipeable gallery on mobile (1 screenshot per viewport).
4. **Feature Table:** Convert to cards, swipe between "without" and "with" MTT.
5. **CTA:** Sticky bottom bar, "Explore All Features" button.

### Mobile-Specific Copy Adjustments
- Hero headline: "Everything You Need to Transition Successfully"
- Feature sections: Show category headlines, tap to expand details
- Screenshots: Show 4 key screenshots (vs 8 on desktop)
- CTA: "Start Free Trial" (feature exploration happens above)

### Performance
- Critical: Lazy load feature sections (page could be heavy with 20+ features described)
- Optimize all screenshots to <150KB each (8 screenshots = careful optimization needed)
- Consider "load more" for feature categories vs showing all at once
- Preload top 3 feature categories, lazy load the rest
