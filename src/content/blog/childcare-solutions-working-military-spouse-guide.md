# Childcare Solutions for Working Military Spouses: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Childcare is one of the biggest barriers to military spouse employment—but multiple programs exist to help. **Child Development Centers (CDCs)** on base offer subsidized care with priority access. **Family Child Care (FCC)** provides home-based options. **Fee assistance programs** can reduce costs at civilian providers. This guide covers all your options, how to navigate waitlists, backup care solutions, and strategies for handling childcare during deployments and PCS moves.
