# Security Clearance Jobs: Complete Guide for Veterans

Your security clearance is one of the most valuable assets you're leaving the military with. While you can't put it in your pocket, it can put tens of thousands of extra dollars in your bank account every year.

The cleared workforce is in constant demand. Companies can't simply hire someone off the street for classified work—they need people who already hold clearances. That's you, and that's worth money.

## Understanding Security Clearances

### Clearance Levels

**Confidential:**
- Lowest level
- Limited job opportunities
- Rarely sufficient alone

**Secret:**
- Most common clearance
- Wide range of opportunities
- Base level for many positions

**Top Secret (TS):**

- More stringent investigation
- Premium compensation

**TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information):**
- Highest commonly held
- Compartmented access
- Maximum salary premium

### Investigation Types

**Tier 1 (T1):** Low risk, public trust
**Tier 2 (T2):** Moderate risk, non-sensitive
**Tier 3 (T3):** Secret clearance
**Tier 5 (T5):** Top Secret, full investigation
**Tier 5R (T5R):** TS reinvestigation

### Special Access Programs (SAP)

Beyond standard clearances:
- Additional screening
- Specific program access
- "Need to know" basis
- Compartmented access

### Polygraph Types

Some positions require:
- **CI Poly:** Counter-intelligence focused
- **Full Scope/Lifestyle:** More comprehensive

## Maintaining Your Clearance

### Active vs. Current

**Active:** Clearance currently valid, in system
**Current:** Investigation completed within timeframe, but not currently active

### Clearance Currency

Clearance remains "current" for:
- **Secret:** 10 years from investigation
- **Top Secret:** 6 years from investigation

If you leave government/contractor work, clearance goes "inactive" but remains current.

### Reactivation

If clearance is current but inactive:
- New employer sponsors reactivation
- No new investigation needed
- Relatively quick process
- Must be within currency timeframe

### Reinvestigation

When investigation expires:
- New investigation required
- Takes 3-12+ months
- Must maintain eligibility
- Continuous evaluation programs help

### Continuous Evaluation

Modern clearance maintenance:
- Automated records checks
- Ongoing monitoring
- Faster identification of issues
- Replaces periodic reinvestigation for some

## Clearance Transition Planning

### Before Separation

**Timeline actions:**

**6+ months out:**
- Understand your clearance status
- Research cleared employers
- Update resume
- Start networking

**3-6 months out:**
- Apply to positions
- Interview with contractors
- Secure offers while still active

**Final month:**
- Confirm clearance transfer
- Ensure investigation currency
- Document clearance details

### Getting Clearance Into System

When hired by contractor:
1. Employer submits sponsorship request
2. Security office verifies clearance
3. Transfers clearance to their facility
4. You can access classified work

Timeline: Days to weeks (if clearance active)

### If There's a Gap

Gap between military and contractor:
- Clearance goes inactive
- Remains current per investigation date
- New employer sponsors reactivation
- No new investigation if within currency period

**Strategy:** Minimize gaps; have job before separation if possible.

## Clearance Maintenance Best Practices

### Continuous Eligibility

Maintain clearance eligibility:
- **Financial responsibility:** Avoid excessive debt, keep current
- **Foreign contacts:** Report as required
- **Criminal activity:** Avoid legal trouble

### Reporting Requirements

- Legal issues
- Security incidents

### Avoiding Pitfalls

Common clearance issues:
- **Financial problems:** Major issue; manage debt
- **Foreign influence:** Report relationships properly

- **Criminal conduct:** Report, don't hide
