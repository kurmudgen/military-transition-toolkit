- Update resume

**Months 3-4:**
- Earn additional certifications (CCNA, AWS, etc.)
- Create ClearanceJobs.com profile
- Build LinkedIn presence

**Months 5-6:**
- Apply to positions (prioritize cleared roles)
- Network with veterans in target industry
- Consider SkillBridge

**Final months:**
- Interview and negotiate
- Accept offer with clearance sponsorship
- Plan transition

### SkillBridge Opportunities

IT/Cyber-focused SkillBridge programs:

- Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA)
- Amazon Web Services
- Cisco Networking Academy
- Various defense contractors
- Onward to Opportunity (O2O)

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "My skills are outdated"

**Reality:** Military IT often uses older systems.

**Solution:** Get cloud and modern certifications. Your fundamentals (networking, security, troubleshooting) transfer. Specific technologies can be learned.

### Challenge 2: No Degree

**Reality:** Many IT jobs don't require degrees.

**Solution:** Certifications often matter more than degrees in IT. Experience + certs + clearance = very competitive.

### Challenge 3: Keeping Clearance

**Reality:** Clearance lapses 24 months after last use.

**Solution:** Target cleared positions. Defense contractors, federal civilian, and cleared commercial positions keep your clearance active.

### Challenge 4: Geographic Limitations

**Reality:** Best cleared jobs are in DC area.

**Solution:** Consider relocation for cleared work, or look at remote positions (growing since pandemic) and commercial IT (no clearance required but may pay less).

Increasingly yes, especially post-pandemic. However, many cleared positions require on-site work at secure facilities.

## Bottom Line

Your 3D experience places you in one of the most in-demand career fields. Cybersecurity and IT professionals are desperately needed—and your military experience gives you advantages most civilian candidates don't have.

**Best opportunities for 3D Airmen:**
1. **Cybersecurity** - Highest demand, best pay growth
2. **Defense contractor IT** - Use clearance, familiar culture
3. **Cloud engineering** - High growth, excellent salaries
4. **Federal civilian** - Security, benefits, veteran preference

Don't let your clearance lapse. Get certifications before you separate. You're walking into a job market that wants exactly what you have.
