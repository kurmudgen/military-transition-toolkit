## Bottom Line Up Front

Marines with Airfield Operations Specialist experience bring **airfield management, flight line operations, aircraft marshalling/parking, airfield inspections, aviation safety protocols, and ground operations coordination**—skills that translate directly to civilian airport operations, Fixed Base Operator (FBO) management, aviation facilities management, and aviation safety positions. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$75,000**, with experienced professionals in airport operations management and aviation safety hitting **$85,000-$130,000+**. Your hands-on airfield operations experience is exactly what civilian airports, FBOs, and aviation companies need—it's a direct career crosswalk with multiple high-demand paths.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every Airfield Operations Specialist transitioning out hears: "Civilian airports are completely different." "You'll start at the bottom." "Military airfield experience doesn't count."

Wrong. Here's what they don't understand: **Airfield operations are airfield operations—military or civilian, the fundamentals are identical.**

You didn't just "work on a flight line." You:
- Managed daily airfield operations and flight line activities
- Marshalled and directed aircraft movement on taxiways and ramps
- Conducted airfield inspections identifying FOD (Foreign Object Debris) and safety hazards
- Coordinated aircraft parking, fueling, and ground servicing
- Maintained airfield status boards and operational information
- Enforced aviation safety regulations and airfield procedures
- Communicated with pilots, tower, and ground crews via radio
- Managed aircraft arrival/departure schedules and parking plans
- Responded to airfield emergencies and incidents
- Trained personnel on airfield safety and operations procedures

That's aviation operations management, safety enforcement, coordination skills, attention to detail, and regulatory compliance. Civilian airports, FBOs, corporate aviation facilities, and aviation companies need exactly these skills. It's a direct transfer—you just need to learn civilian FAA regulations instead of military procedures.
