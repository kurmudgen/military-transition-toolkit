# VA Disability Rating for Sinusitis and Rhinitis: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Sinusitis is rated under **Diagnostic Code 6513** (maxillary sinusitis) with ratings of **0%, 10%, 30%, or 50%**. Allergic rhinitis is rated under **DC 6522** at **0%, 10%, or 30%**. Both conditions are common among veterans due to environmental exposures during service, including burn pit exposure (now presumptive under PACT Act). Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Sinusitis and Rhinitis?

**Sinusitis:** Inflammation or infection of the sinuses causing pressure, pain, and congestion.
- Acute: Temporary
- Chronic: Lasting 12+ weeks

**Rhinitis:** Inflammation of nasal passages causing congestion, runny nose, and sneezing.
- Allergic rhinitis: Due to allergens
- Vasomotor rhinitis: Non-allergic

**Military connections:**

- **Burn pit exposure** (PACT Act presumptive)
- Environmental exposures during deployment
- Dust, sand, chemicals
- Smoke, fumes
- Cold weather exposure
- Aggravation of pre-existing allergies

## VA Rating Criteria

### Sinusitis (DC 6510-6514)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Detected by X-ray only |
| **10%** | One or two incapacitating episodes per year requiring prolonged (4-6 weeks) antibiotic treatment, OR three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting |
| **30%** | Three or more incapacitating episodes per year requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment, OR more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year |
| **50%** | Following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, OR near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries |

### Allergic Rhinitis (DC 6522)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Without polyps |
| **10%** | Without polyps, but with greater than 50% obstruction of nasal passage on both sides OR complete obstruction on one side |
| **30%** | With polyps |

### Key Terms
- **Incapacitating episode**: Severe enough to require bed rest and treatment by physician
- **Non-incapacitating episode**: Symptoms present but not requiring bed rest

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing sinus issues
- Documentation of environmental exposures
- Deployment to areas with dust, burn pits
- PACT Act qualifying service

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- ENT evaluation
- CT scan of sinuses
- Nasal endoscopy results
- Diagnosis of sinusitis or rhinitis

### Severity Evidence
- Frequency of infections (document each episode)
- Antibiotic prescriptions
- Surgery records
- CT findings (polyps, obstruction)

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Examine nasal passages
3. Review imaging
4. Assess obstruction percentage
5. Document episode frequency

**What to tell them:**
- How many sinus infections per year
- Antibiotic treatments received
- Surgery history
- Daily symptoms

## Secondary Conditions

**Rhinitis/sinusitis can cause:**
- Sleep apnea (nasal obstruction)
- Asthma (lower airway involvement)
- Headaches/migraines
- Ear infections

**Can be secondary to:**
- Deviated septum (from injury)
- Environmental exposures

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is sinusitis presumptive under PACT Act?

### Can I claim both sinusitis and rhinitis?
Yes, if you have both conditions. They're rated under different diagnostic codes.

### What if I have nasal polyps?
Nasal polyps support 30% for rhinitis under DC 6522.
