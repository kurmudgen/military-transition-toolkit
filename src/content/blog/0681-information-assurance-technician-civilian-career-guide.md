## Bottom Line Up Front

As a Marine Corps 0681 Information Assurance Technician, you've got **DoD 8570/8140 compliance, Risk Management Framework (RMF), security controls implementation, and vulnerability management** experience that civilian cybersecurity employers desperately need. Entry-level InfoSec positions start at **$85,000-$110,000**, with experienced professionals hitting **$120,000-$165,000+**. **IAT Level II certified roles pay $135,000-$216,000** for defense contractors. Your **active security clearance adds $30,000-$40,000 salary premium**, and your hands-on experience implementing NIST 800-53 controls and conducting security audits puts you ahead of college grads who've never touched a real system. You'll need CISSP or advanced certifications for senior roles, but your operational security experience is exactly what companies need.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

You've been told cybersecurity is booming. Six-figure salaries. Unlimited demand. High job security.

**It's all true. But here's what nobody mentions: most "cybersecurity professionals" can't do what you do.**

College grads with cybersecurity degrees know theory. They took classes on CIA triad, risk management frameworks, and security controls. But when you ask them to actually implement STIGs on a production system, conduct an RMF assessment, or manage security controls for classified networks—they can't do it.

**You can. That's worth serious money.**

As a 0681, you weren't just reading security policies. You were:
- Implementing and validating DoD Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)
- Conducting Risk Management Framework (RMF) assessments and authorizations
- Managing security controls per NIST 800-53
- Performing vulnerability assessments using ACAS/Nessus
- Ensuring systems met DoD 8500/8510 security requirements
- Managing Information Assurance (IA) controls for classified systems
- Coordinating security accreditation packages (A&A)
- Responding to security incidents and implementing remediation
- Maintaining continuous monitoring and compliance
- Operating in environments where security failures had serious consequences

That's **enterprise-level governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)** work combined with hands-on technical security. Companies pay **$100,000-$150,000** for people who can do both. Government contractors pay **$130,000-$180,000** for cleared professionals with your background.

The problem is civilian HR sees "0681 Information Assurance Technician" and doesn't understand what you actually did. You need to translate your experience into language they understand: **Information Security Analyst, Compliance Engineer, Security Controls Assessor, GRC Analyst.**

## Best civilian career paths for 0681

Let's break down specific roles with real 2024-2025 salary data and transition strategies.

- **Continuing Education (CE) credits** to maintain certs

**Reality check:**
Defense contracting is where your 0681 experience has maximum value. **Your active clearance alone is worth $25,000-$40,000 salary premium.**

A TS/SCI clearance costs companies $15,000+ and 12-18 months to obtain. If you have one, you're immediately more valuable than civilian candidates with better credentials but no clearance.

**IAT Level II positions (requiring Security+, CySA+, or CISSP) with TS/SCI clearance pay $135,000-$165,000 entry to mid-level.** That's massive compared to similar corporate roles at $85K-$110K.

Companies hiring: Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI, Leidos, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Peraton, SAIC, ManTech, Raytheon.

You'll be doing RMF assessments, security compliance, and system authorizations—exact same work as active duty but with significantly better compensation.

**Downside:** Contract-based employment (contracts end every 2-5 years), may require relocation to DC/Maryland/Virginia or other military installations.

**Best for:** 0681s with active clearances who want maximum immediate salary and familiar mission/environment.
