[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

Think your VA rating is set in stone? Think again. In 2024, VA processed over 2.5 million disability claims - including hundreds of thousands of rating increase requests. Here's what matters: If you file within one year of your condition worsening, you get backpay from the date it actually got worse. File after that year? You only get paid from the day you submit the claim. That difference could be $15,000 to $30,000 sitting on the table. Your service-connected conditions don't stay static - they change, they worsen, and when they do, your rating should reflect that reality. I'm Jacob, Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're covering exactly how to file for a rating increase when your conditions get worse. This is Veteran Transition Blueprint.

**When Should You File for an Increase?**

First thing you need to understand: Having a VA rating doesn't mean you're done. Most service-connected conditions change over time. Some get better, most get worse. When your condition worsens, you're entitled to file for an increase.

Here's what constitutes a legitimate reason to file:

**Your symptoms have increased in frequency or severity.** If your PTSD went from occasional anxiety to daily panic attacks - that's worsening. If your back pain went from manageable to requiring surgery - that's worsening. If your migraines went from monthly to weekly - you get the idea.

**Your condition now requires more treatment.** You started needing physical therapy three times a week instead of monthly. You got prescribed stronger medications. You needed surgery you didn't need before. More treatment equals worse condition equals potential rating increase.

**Your functional limitations have increased.** This is huge. Maybe your knee condition didn't stop you from working two years ago, but now you can't stand for more than 20 minutes. Maybe your mental health condition didn't affect your relationships before, but now you're having serious family problems because of it.

**You've developed complications or progression.** Your diabetes got worse and now you have neuropathy. Your back condition led to radiculopathy. Your PTSD symptoms increased after a triggering event.

Here's 2024 reality: VA approved 60.4% of all claims filed, which means if you have legitimate evidence of worsening, you've got better than even odds of success.

**The One-Year Rule That Could Cost You Thousands**

Listen carefully to this timing rule because it's the difference between maximum backpay and leaving money on the table.

**The rule:** If you file for an increase within one year of when your condition worsened, VA will backdate your effective date to when it actually got worse. File after that one-year window closes, and your effective date is only the date you submit the claim.

Real example: Your PTSD clearly worsened in January 2024. If you file by January 2025, and VA grants the increase, you get backpay from January 2024. But if you wait until March 2025 to file, you only get backpay from March 2025 forward - you just lost 14 months of the higher rate.

Let me put numbers on this. Say you go from 50% to 70% for PTSD. That's a jump from $1,075.16 to $1,716.28 monthly in 2025 - a difference of $641.12 per month. Wait two years to file? You just left $15,387 on the table.

**How VA determines when your condition worsened:**

They look at your medical records. If your doctor noted significant worsening in August 2024, that becomes your potential effective date - if you file within a year. Treatment notes showing increased symptoms, new prescriptions, surgical records, hospitalization dates - all this documents when worsening occurred.

**Pro tip:** If you know your condition is getting worse, don't wait for it to be "bad enough." File within that one-year window of when you first notice significant worsening. You can always provide updated evidence while your claim is processing.

**What Evidence Do You Actually Need?**

Filing for an increase isn't complicated, but you need the right documentation. Here's what VA wants to see:

**Current medical records showing worsening.** This is your foundation. You need recent records - ideally from the past 6-12 months - that document:
- Increased symptom frequency or severity
- New treatments or medications
- Functional limitations that didn't exist before
- Physician notes stating the condition has worsened

**Treatment history.** Continuous treatment is gold. If you've been seeing doctors regularly for your service-connected condition and those records show progressive worsening, that's powerful evidence. Emergency room visits, surgical records, mental health treatment notes, physical therapy records - gather all of it.

**Lay statements.** Your own statement describing how your condition has worsened and how it affects your daily life. Be specific: "Two years ago I could work an 8-hour shift standing. Now I can only stand 20 minutes before severe pain forces me to sit. I've had to modify my job duties and I can no longer do activities with my kids like hiking or playing sports."

Buddy statements from people who've observed your worsening condition. Spouse, coworkers, fellow veterans who knew you before and after. Their statements should include specific examples and timeframes.

**Civilian medical opinions if needed.** For complex cases or where VA medical records might not fully capture worsening, consider getting a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) from a private provider. Cost runs $1,500-$2,500 but can be worth it for significant increases.

**Here's what you don't need:** You don't need to prove service connection again. You already have that. You're just proving your service-connected condition got worse.

**Filing Process Step by Step**

Let's walk through exactly how to file for an increase.

**Step One: Gather your evidence.** Before you start the claim, compile everything:
- Recent medical records from past 12 months minimum
- List of all treatments, medications, surgeries since your last rating
- Your written statement on how condition worsened
- Buddy statements if you have them
- Any DBQs from private doctors

**Step Two: File VA Form 21-526EZ.** This is the same form used for original claims, but you're specifically requesting an increase for an existing service-connected condition. You can file three ways:

Online at VA.gov - fastest method, upload documents directly. Log in, go to disability section, "file for a disability increase."

By mail - fill out form, include copies of all evidence, mail to VA regional office. Make copies of everything.

Through a VSO - they'll help you complete the form and ensure you're submitting complete evidence.

**Step Three: Attend the C&P exam.** VA will schedule you for a new Compensation and Pension exam to evaluate your current condition. This is critical. Review Episode 50 for C&P exam strategies, but key points:

Show up. Missing your exam delays your claim by months.

Bring copies of your medical records and medications list.

Describe your worst days, not your average days. The examiner needs to understand your condition at its worst to properly rate it.

Be specific about functional limitations. Don't say "my back hurts." Say "I can't stand for more than 20 minutes, I can't lift more than 10 pounds, I need to lie down 2-3 times daily because of pain."

**Step Four: Wait for the decision.** Current processing times for rating increase claims run around 125+ days on average. Some faster, some slower. In 2024, VA broke records processing 2.5 million claims, but volume is still high.

**Step Five: Review your decision.** When you get the decision letter, read it carefully. They'll tell you:
- Whether your increase was granted and new rating
- Effective date for the increase
- Amount of backpay
- Right to appeal if denied

**The Risk Nobody Talks About**

Here's something critical you need to know: When you file for an increase, VA will re-evaluate your entire condition. That means they could potentially decrease your rating if their examiner finds your condition has actually improved.

**Reality check:** This doesn't happen often, but it can happen. In 2024 data, the vast majority of rating changes were increases or stayed the same. But if you haven't been treating your condition, if you've told doctors you're feeling better, if the examiner sees clear improvement - they can reduce your rating.

**Protection:** Ratings at 20 years or more, or held continuously for 20 years, are protected from reduction except for fraud. If you've been at your current rating for 20 years, you're safe filing for an increase.

Ratings at 55+ years old and held for 10+ years are also protected under the "55-year-old rule" - they won't reduce you even if condition improves.

**Smart approach:** Only file for increase if your condition legitimately worsened. Document that worsening with medical evidence. Don't file for increase if you're just hoping for more money but your condition is actually stable or improving.

**Backpay: When It Arrives and How Much**

Let's talk about the payoff - your VA disability backpay for the increase.

**Calculation:** Backpay is the difference between your old rate and new rate, multiplied by the number of months from your effective date to when VA grants the increase.

Example: You go from 40% ($755.28) to 60% ($1,361.88) - difference of $606.60 per month. Your effective date is 10 months before approval date. Your backpay: $6,066. That arrives as one lump sum.

**Timing:** VA typically issues backpay within 15-30 days after your claim is approved. It deposits directly into whatever bank account you have on file for your VA payments.

**Increases stack with COLA:** Your new higher rating gets the annual Cost of Living Adjustment. In 2025, that's 2.5%. So not only do you get the increase, but that increased amount grows with COLA every year.

**Tax-free:** VA disability compensation is tax-free, including backpay. That $20,000 backpay check is $20,000 in your pocket.

**Long-term value:** Let's say you're 45 years old and you get increased from 50% to 70%. That's $641.12 more per month. Over the next 20 years, with conservative COLA increases, that's over $180,000 in additional lifetime compensation. That's why filing for increases when your conditions worsen matters.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

**Mistake #1: Waiting too long to file.** Remember that one-year rule. File within a year of worsening to maximize backpay. I see veterans wait 3-4 years, then file - they get the increase but lose tens of thousands in backpay.

**Mistake #2: Not documenting worsening.** "I'm worse than I was" isn't evidence. You need medical records, treatment notes, and specific examples of increased limitations.

**Mistake #3: Exaggerating at the C&P exam.** Be honest about your symptoms. Examiners are trained to spot inconsistencies. If you claim you can't move your arm above shoulder height but the examiner watches you reach up to adjust your hat, you just hurt your credibility.

**Mistake #4: Filing increase too soon after initial rating.** If you just got rated 30% for your knee three months ago and you immediately file for increase to 50%, VA's going to question whether it actually worsened or if you were underrated initially. Unless there's clear new worsening event, wait at least 6-12 months between initial rating and increase request.

**Mistake #5: Not seeking treatment.** If you claim your condition is worse but you haven't seen a doctor in two years, VA will question whether it's actually worse or you're just hoping for more money. Consistent treatment equals credibility.

**Mistake #6: Filing for increase on a static condition.** Some conditions are rated as "static" meaning VA doesn't expect them to change - like amputations, certain permanent scars, total vision or hearing loss. Filing for increase on truly static conditions wastes your time.

**When to Get Help**

**VSOs can help with:** Completing the form, gathering evidence, attending hearings, explaining the process. They're free.

**VA-accredited attorneys can help with:** Complex cases, denied increases that need appeals, situations where VA reduced your rating. They charge 20-33% of past-due benefits but only if you win.

**Private medical examiners can help with:** Getting DBQs and nexus opinions when your VA records don't fully capture worsening. Cost is upfront ($1,500-$2,500) but you pay whether you win or lose.

**My take:** Start with a VSO for standard increases. If you get denied and the denial doesn't make sense, consider an attorney for the appeal. Get private medical evidence upfront if you have complex conditions where VA's exams have historically lowballed your ratings.

**Final Numbers to Remember**

File within one year of worsening to maximize backpay. After one year, you lose all that retroactive pay.

60.4% of claims granted in 2024 - you have better than even odds with solid evidence.

125+ days average processing time - file early, be patient.

15-30 days for backpay after approval - plan accordingly.

The difference between 50% and 70% is over $640/month - over $180,000 across 20 years. Rating increases aren't pocket change.

If your service-connected conditions have worsened, file for the increase you deserve. Document it. Prove it. Get paid for it.
