# Federal Job Search for Military Spouses: PPP Hiring Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Federal jobs offer military spouses **job security, excellent benefits, PCS portability, and spouse preference programs**. Positions exist at most duty stations through DoD and other agencies. Salaries follow the **GS pay scale** ($35,000-$150,000+ depending on grade and location). The application process is different from private sector—you must master **USA Jobs** and understand federal hiring to succeed. With military spouse preference, you have advantages that civilian applicants don't.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Federal employment solves key military spouse problems:

| Challenge | Federal Solution |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Jobs don't exist at duty stations | Federal positions at most installations |
| Starting over each PCS | Transfer rights for many positions |
| No career advancement | Clear promotion paths (GS levels) |
| Benefits lost when moving | Federal benefits are portable |
| Preference programs unused | MSP, PPP, EO 13832 available |

**The Catch:** Federal hiring is bureaucratic, slow, and confusing. This guide cuts through the complexity.

## Understanding Federal Job Categories

## Navigating USA Jobs

### Creating Your Account

**usajobs.gov Essentials:**
1. Create login.gov account (new requirement)
2. Complete full profile
3. Upload documents to account
4. Build and save resumes (multiple versions)

### Profile Setup for Military Spouses

**Critical Sections:**
- **Hiring Paths:** Select "Military Spouses"
- **Preferences:** Indicate spouse eligibility
- **Documents:** Upload marriage certificate, PCS orders

**Resume Requirements:**
Federal resumes are DIFFERENT than private sector:
- 3-5 pages acceptable (not limited to 1-2)
- Include ALL relevant experience
- Use specific language from job posting
- Include supervisor names, hours worked, salary
- No personal pronouns ("I did..." becomes "Managed...")

### Searching for Jobs

**Filters to Use:**
- Location: Your duty station area
- Hiring Path: Military Spouses
- Agency: All or specific (DoD for MSP)
- Salary: Set realistic range

**Search Terms:**
- Start broad, then narrow
- Try different job titles
- Use job series numbers (e.g., 0301 for admin)

### Understanding Job Announcements

**Key Sections:**
- **Who May Apply:** Critical—must include your hiring path
- **Duties:** What the job involves
- **Qualifications:** Education and experience required
- **How You Will Be Evaluated:** Basis for scoring
- **Required Documents:** What to submit
- **How to Apply:** Application instructions

**Decoding "Who May Apply":**
- "Open to the public" = Anyone can apply
- "Federal employees" = Current feds only
- "Military spouses" = You're eligible

## Federal Application Strategy

### Step-by-Step Application

**Step 1: Find Appropriate Positions**
- Search USA Jobs with military spouse filter
- Read announcements carefully
- Verify you meet qualifications

**Step 2: Tailor Your Resume**
- Match language in announcement
- Highlight relevant experience
- Include keywords from duties/qualifications
- Quantify accomplishments

**Step 3: Complete Questionnaire**
- Answer ALL questions
- Be accurate but not modest
- Every "Expert" vs. "Proficient" matters

**Step 4: Upload Documents**
- Military spouse documentation
- Transcripts (if education required)
- Certifications (if applicable)
- SF-50 (if current federal employee)

**Step 5: Submit and Verify**
- Confirm complete submission
- Check for errors
- Save confirmation

### Questionnaire Strategy

**How Questionnaires Work:**
- Self-assessment of skills/experience
- Scored by HR to determine qualification level
- Affects whether you make "best qualified" list

**Honest but Not Modest:**
- "Expert" = You can do this independently without supervision
- "Considerable" = You can do this with minimal guidance
- "Basic" = You've done this but need supervision

**Common Mistake:**
Rating yourself too low. If you can perform the task, don't underrate. But don't lie—false claims can disqualify you.

### The Waiting Game

**Typical Federal Hiring Timeline:**
- Application closes → 2-4 weeks for HR review
- HR review → 2-4 weeks for referral
- Referral → 2-6 weeks for interview
- Interview → 2-4 weeks for selection
- Selection → 2-4 weeks for offer
- **Total: 2-6 months is normal**

**Status Meanings:**
- "Received" = Application submitted
- "Reviewed" = HR is evaluating
- "Referred" = Sent to hiring manager (GOOD)
- "Not Referred" = Didn't make the cut
- "Selected" = You got the job!
- "Not Selected" = Position filled by someone else

## Priority Placement Program (PPP)

### What PPP Does

**Automatic Consideration:**
- Register once, get matched to positions
- No need to apply individually to each job
- Priority over other external applicants

### How to Register

**Contact:**
- Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) at installation
- Human Resources Office
- Ask specifically about "Priority Placement Program" or "Stopper List"

**Registration Process:**
1. Request registration packet
2. Complete skills inventory
3. Specify job series and grades
4. Indicate geographic preferences
5. Submit required documentation

### PPP Matching

**System Matches You To:**
- Positions matching your job series
- Appropriate grade level
- Geographic area
- Qualification requirements

**When Matched:**
- HR contacts you about position
- You can accept or decline
- Declining may affect future placement (ask about rules)

## Transfer Rights and Portability

### Moving with Your Federal Job

**Some Positions Allow Transfer:**
- Lateral transfer to same position at new location
- Possible if position exists at new duty station
- Must coordinate with both losing and gaining HR

**How It Works:**
1. Contact current supervisor about transfer possibility
2. Identify positions at new location
3. Work with HR at both ends
4. May be competitive or non-competitive depending on position

### What Usually Happens

**Reality for Most:**
- Transfer not guaranteed
- May need to re-compete for new position
- Some agencies transfer more easily than others
- DoD often has positions at multiple installations

### Tips for Portability

- Choose job series with positions at most installations
- Build relationships with HR before PCS
- Start looking 6+ months before move
- Consider remote-eligible positions

**Growing Trend:**

## Common Federal Job Search Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Private Sector Resume

Federal resumes need:
- Full employment history (not just relevant)
- Supervisor contact information
- Specific duties and accomplishments
- Keywords from announcement

### Mistake 2: Underrating Yourself

Don't rate "Basic" if you can do it with minimal supervision. Your questionnaire score determines referral.

### Mistake 3: Not Claiming Preference

Always indicate military spouse status. Don't assume HR will figure it out.

### Mistake 4: Giving Up Too Fast

Federal hiring takes months. Apply to multiple positions. Be patient.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring NAF

NAF positions are easier to get and can lead to GS opportunities.
