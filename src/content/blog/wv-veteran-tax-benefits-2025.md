## Bottom Line Up Front

West Virginia offers substantial tax benefits for veterans that can save you thousands annually. Veterans with a 90% or greater VA disability rating can claim a refundable income tax credit equal to their property taxes paid (effective 2024). Veterans with 100% permanent and total disability get a full property tax exemption. ALL military retirement income has been 100% exempt from state income tax since 2019. Seniors 65+ can stack a $20,000 assessed value homestead exemption. West Virginia's average effective property tax rate of just 0.55% is among the nation's lowest. Over 20 years, a 100% disabled veteran in Charleston saving $1,200 annually in property taxes plus $3,000 yearly on retirement income taxation could save over $84,000.

## West Virginia Military Retirement Income Tax: 100% Exempt

Here's the best news first: West Virginia does NOT tax military retirement income, period. This full exemption took effect January 1, 2019 and remains in force for 2024 and 2025.

### What's Covered

The exemption includes ALL military retirement income from:
- Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard
- Public Health Service and NOAA uniformed services
- Reserve and National Guard retirement
- Survivorship annuities (SBP, RCSBP, RSFPP)

There are no age restrictions, no income limits, and no caps. If you receive military retirement pay, you exclude 100% of it from your West Virginia state income tax.

### Real Dollar Impact

**Example Calculation:**
- E-7 with 20 years: ~$2,400/month = $28,800/year
- WV tax rate: 5.12% (top bracket)
- Annual savings: $1,475
- 20-year savings: $29,500
- 30-year savings: $44,250

**O-5 with 22 years: ~$4,800/month = $57,600/year**
- Annual savings: $2,949
- 20-year savings: $58,980
- 30-year savings: $88,470

This exemption makes West Virginia one of the most tax-friendly states for military retirees in the Mid-Atlantic region.

## Property Tax Benefits for Disabled Veterans

West Virginia offers TWO separate property tax programs for disabled veterans. Which one you qualify for depends on your disability rating.

### Option 1: Disabled Veteran Property Tax Credit (90%+ Disability)

Effective January 1, 2024, honorably discharged veterans with a 90% or greater VA Combined Disability Rating qualify for a refundable income tax credit equal to the property taxes paid on their homestead.

**How It Works:**
1. You pay your property taxes on time (first half by October 1, second half by April 1)
2. When you file your West Virginia Personal Income Tax Return, you claim the credit using Form DV-1
3. If the credit exceeds your income tax liability, you get a refund for the difference

**Required Documentation:**
- Form DV-1 (Disabled Veteran Real Property Tax Credit)
- Property tax receipt(s) for both installments
- Copy of VA Disability Rating letter showing 90% or higher
- DD-214 showing honorable discharge

**Important Limitations:**
- Must be used or occupied as your homestead for at least 6 months of the year
- Covers single-family homes, including mobile, manufactured, or modular homes plus surrounding land
- Cannot combine with Senior Citizen Tax Credit or Homestead Excess Property Tax Credit
- Must file with your personal income tax return (due April 15, 2025 for tax year 2024)

**Contact for Questions:**

### Option 2: 100% Disabled Veteran Property Tax Exemption

Veterans with 100% permanent and total (P&T) service-connected disability certified by the VA qualify for a FULL property tax exemption on their primary residence.

**Key Differences from 90% Credit:**
- This is an upfront exemption (you don't pay taxes at all)
- Only for 100% P&T disabled veterans
- No income tax filing required
- Apply directly with County Assessor's Office
- Must apply by December 1 of the year BEFORE the exemption takes effect

**Application Process:**
1. Contact your County Assessor's Office
2. Provide DD-214 (honorable discharge)
3. Provide VA rating letter showing 100% P&T
4. Complete county exemption application
5. File by December 1, 2024 for 2025 tax year

This is a superior benefit if you qualify because you never pay the taxes in the first place, avoiding cash flow issues.

### Dollar Amounts By County

Here's what 100% disabled veterans save annually in property taxes across West Virginia's largest cities (based on median home values and county tax rates):

**Charleston (Kanawha County):**
- Median home value: $187,300
- Assessed value (60%): $112,380
- Effective tax rate: 0.69%
- Annual property tax without exemption: $775
- 20-year savings: $15,500
- 30-year savings: $23,250

**Huntington (Cabell County):**
- Median home value: $157,000
- Assessed value: $94,200
- Effective tax rate: 0.58%
- Annual property tax without exemption: $546
- 20-year savings: $10,920
- 30-year savings: $16,380

**Morgantown (Monongalia County):**
- Median home value: $267,000
- Assessed value: $160,200
- Effective tax rate: 0.49%
- Annual savings: $785
- 20-year savings: $15,700
- 30-year savings: $23,550

**Parkersburg (Wood County):**
- Median home value: $113,900
- Assessed value: $68,340
- Effective tax rate: 0.55%
- Annual savings: $376
- 20-year savings: $7,520
- 30-year savings: $11,280

**Martinsburg (Berkeley County):**

- 30-year savings: $38,820

**Wheeling (Ohio County):**
- Median home value: $142,000
- Assessed value: $85,200
- Effective tax rate: 0.89% (HIGHEST in WV)
- Annual savings: $758
- 20-year savings: $15,160
- 30-year savings: $22,740

### Which Option Should You Choose?

**Choose the 90% Credit if:**
- Your disability rating is 90-99%
- You don't mind the cash flow of paying taxes then getting refunded
- You want to ensure you get every dollar back through your tax return

**Choose the 100% Exemption if:**
- Your rating is exactly 100% P&T
- You prefer not paying taxes upfront
- You want simplified annual tax filing

**Can't use both:** State law prohibits "double-dipping" between veteran tax benefits and other credits.

## Homestead Exemption for Veterans 65 and Older

Veterans age 65+ (or permanently and totally disabled by any cause) qualify for West Virginia's Homestead Exemption, which reduces assessed property value by $20,000.

### Eligibility Requirements

- Age 65 or older by July 1 of the tax year, OR permanently and totally disabled (any cause)
- West Virginia resident for minimum 2 consecutive years
- Own and occupy property as primary residence
- NO income restrictions (unlike Senior Citizen Tax Credit)

### Application Details

**When to Apply:** Between July 1 and December 1 annually
**Where to Apply:** County Assessor's Office
**Required Documents:**
- Proof of age (driver's license, birth certificate)
- Proof of residency for 2+ years
- Property deed

**Important:** The homestead exemption is NOT based on income. You can have substantial retirement income and still qualify based solely on age.

### Dollar Savings Examples

The $20,000 reduction applies to ASSESSED value, not market value. West Virginia assesses residential property at 60% of market value.

**Example 1: Charleston Home**
- Market value: $200,000
- Normal assessed value: $120,000
- With homestead exemption: $100,000
- Tax rate: 0.69%
- Annual savings: $138
- 20-year savings (age 65-85): $2,760

**Example 2: Morgantown Home**
- Market value: $267,000
- Normal assessed value: $160,200
- With homestead exemption: $140,200
- Tax rate: 0.49%
- Annual savings: $98
- 20-year savings: $1,960

While less dramatic than the disabled veteran exemptions, the homestead exemption provides modest relief and can be used alongside military retirement income exemptions.

### Can You Stack Benefits?

**Disabled Veteran Property Tax Credit (90%+) + Homestead = NO**
The law specifically prohibits claiming the Disabled Veteran Credit if you take the Senior Citizen Tax Credit or Homestead Excess Property Tax Credit.

**100% Disabled Veteran Exemption + Homestead = DOESN'T MATTER**
If you have the 100% exemption, you're already paying $0 in property taxes. The homestead exemption provides no additional benefit.

**Military Retirement Income Exemption + Any Property Program = YES**
The military retirement income tax exemption is separate and can be combined with ANY property tax program.

## Senior Citizen Tax Credit (SCTC)

Low-income veterans age 65+ may qualify for an additional refundable tax credit if household adjusted gross income falls below federal poverty guideline thresholds.

### 2024-2025 Income Limits

- Single person household: $22,590 or less
- Two-person household: $30,660 or less
- Each additional person: Add $8,070

### Credit Amount

The credit amount is calculated based on a formula involving property taxes paid, income, and household size. Maximum credit varies but can offset several hundred dollars in tax liability.

### Application Deadline

Must be submitted by April 15, 2025 for tax year 2024.

### Important Limitation

**Cannot combine SCTC with Disabled Veteran Property Tax Credit.** If you qualify for both, calculate which provides greater benefit. Generally:
- Higher property taxes → Disabled Veteran Credit better
- Lower property taxes + income near limit → SCTC might be better

## Vehicle Property Taxes: What Veterans Need to Know

Here's the disappointing news: West Virginia does NOT offer property tax exemptions on vehicles for veterans who have separated from service.

### Active Duty Exception

West Virginia DOES exempt personal property (including vehicles) for active-duty military personnel who:
- Maintain West Virginia residency
- Are stationed OUTSIDE West Virginia
- Register vehicles in West Virginia

**This exemption ends when you separate from service.** Once you're a veteran, your vehicle is taxed like any other resident's.

### Why This Matters

Some West Virginia counties levy significant personal property taxes on vehicles. Unlike the real property programs for disabled veterans, there's no vehicle exemption available.

**Typical Annual Vehicle Property Tax:**
- $20,000 vehicle value
- Assessed at 60%: $12,000
- County rate 0.50%: $60/year
- Rate 1.00%: $120/year

Not a huge amount, but worth understanding as you budget for post-military life in West Virginia.

### Legislative Watch

Several veterans advocacy groups have proposed expanding property tax relief to include vehicles for disabled veterans. Monitor West Virginia Legislature website (wvlegislature.gov) for updates on bills like HB 2526 expansions.

2. **Military retirement exemption is universal:** ALL veterans benefit equally from the military retirement income tax exemption regardless of disability status

3. **Location impacts savings:** Berkeley County (Martinsburg) property tax exemptions worth $1,294/year vs. Webster County worth $300/year

4. **Rank affects income savings:** Officers with higher retirement pay save more in absolute dollars on income tax exemption (though same percentage)

5. **90% rating sweet spot:** Veterans at 90-99% disability get nearly identical benefits to 100% through the tax credit program

## Real Estate Planning: Maximizing Your Benefits

Strategic decisions about where and what to buy in West Virginia can significantly increase your tax savings.

### County Selection Strategy

**For 100% Disabled Veterans:**
Counter-intuitively, consider HIGHER tax counties like Berkeley, Ohio, and Jefferson. Since you pay $0 regardless, focus on:
- Proximity to VA facilities
- Job opportunities for family members
- Home appreciation potential
- Quality of life factors

You're exempted from $1,294/year in Berkeley County vs. $300/year in Webster County, but that doesn't affect your bottom line. Choose based on lifestyle, not tax rates.

**For 90% Disabled Veterans:**
Same strategy as 100% disabled. The tax credit refunds you fully regardless of county rates.

**For Veterans Without Disability Ratings:**
Prioritize LOWER tax counties to minimize what you actually pay:
- Randolph, Webster, Clay counties: 0.40-0.45% rates
- Save $200-400/year on median homes compared to high-tax counties

### Home Value Considerations

**100% or 90% Disabled Veterans:**
Buy as much home as you can afford and want. Property tax exemption/credit covers you regardless of home value. Don't let property tax concerns limit your housing choices.

**Veterans Without Disability Ratings:**
Balance home value with tax implications. A $267,000 home in Morgantown costs $785/year in property taxes vs. $376/year for a $113,900 home in Parkersburg. Factor property taxes into your total housing cost calculations.

### Application Timing

**For 100% Exemption:**
- Must apply by December 1 of PRIOR year
- Example: Apply by Dec 1, 2024 for 2025 exemption
- Miss the deadline, you pay 2025 taxes (though can claim 90% credit if you qualify)

**For 90% Credit:**
- No advance application to county
- Just need to file tax return by April 15 with Form DV-1
- More forgiving timeline

### Documentation Organization

Create a "Tax Benefits" folder (physical or digital) with:
- DD-214 (certified copies)
- Current VA rating letter
- Property tax receipts (both installments)
- Previous year tax returns
- Contact info for county assessor

Update annually and keep accessible. Missing documentation delays processing of exemptions and credits.

## Surviving Spouse Benefits

West Virginia provides limited benefits for surviving spouses of veterans. Here's what transfers and what doesn't.

### Property Tax Exemption (100% Disabled Veteran)

**Does NOT automatically transfer to surviving spouse.**

West Virginia law does not explicitly provide for surviving spouses to continue the 100% disabled veteran property tax exemption after the veteran's death.

Compare this to Virginia and Maryland, which DO extend property tax exemptions to surviving spouses. West Virginia lags behind in this area.

### Military Retirement Income

**Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments ARE exempt from West Virginia income tax.**

The military retirement income exemption includes survivor annuities, so:
- SBP payments: Exempt
- RCSBP (Reserve): Exempt
- RSFPP (Reserve Survivors): Exempt

A surviving spouse receiving $2,000/month in SBP ($24,000/year) saves $1,229/year in state income taxes.

### Homestead Exemption (Age 65+)

**Surviving spouse CAN continue homestead exemption if they:**
- Are 65+ or permanently disabled
- Continue to own and occupy the property
- Meet the 2-year residency requirement

The $20,000 assessed value reduction saves $100-200/year depending on county tax rates.

### Recommendations for Surviving Spouses

1. **File for homestead exemption if 65+:** Don't let this benefit lapse
2. **Understand SBP income tax exemption:** Factor this into retirement planning
3. **Monitor legislation:** Advocate for surviving spouse property tax exemption expansion
4. **Consider relocating to VA or MD:** If property taxes become burdensome, neighboring states offer superior surviving spouse benefits

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Applying for 100% Exemption by December 1

Veterans miss the deadline and pay full property taxes for an entire year. The exemption is NOT retroactive in most counties.

**Solution:** Set a November 1 reminder annually to verify your exemption is current. If you're newly rated 100%, apply immediately.

### Mistake 2: Claiming Both 90% Credit and Homestead Exemption

State law prohibits combining the Disabled Veteran Credit with the Homestead Excess Property Tax Credit or Senior Citizen Tax Credit.

**Solution:** Calculate which benefit provides greater value. Usually the 90% credit provides more benefit than SCTC for property owners.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to File Form DV-1

Veterans with 90% rating pay their property taxes but forget to claim the credit on their income tax return.

**Solution:** Note on your calendar: "File Form DV-1 with tax return" every April. Consider working with a tax preparer familiar with veteran benefits.

### Mistake 4: Not Updating After Rating Increase

Veteran is rated 70% for years, increases to 90% or 100%, but never applies for property tax benefits.

**Solution:** Immediately after any rating increase to 90%+, contact county assessor (for 100%) or prepare Form DV-1 (for 90%) for next tax year.

### Mistake 5: Assuming Vehicle Exemption

Veterans expect personal property tax exemption on vehicles based on their disability rating. It doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Budget for vehicle property taxes as a normal expense. Advocate for legislative changes.

### Mistake 6: Missing Documentation

Veterans apply for exemption without certified DD-214 or current rating letter. Application is denied or delayed.

**Solution:** Request certified DD-214 copies from National Archives (free) and always keep current VA rating letters. Order extras of both.

### Mistake 7: Not Informing County of Address Changes

Veteran moves to different property but doesn't re-apply for exemption at new county assessor's office.

**Solution:** Treat county assessor notification as essential as updating driver's license when moving. Re-apply for all exemptions.

### Mistake 8: Assuming Benefits Are Automatic

Veterans think the VA automatically informs state/county officials of their status. Benefits are NOT automatic.

**Solution:** Proactively apply for every benefit you qualify for. County assessors and state tax departments don't receive VA rating information automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Do I pay property taxes if I'm 100% disabled but NOT permanent and total?**

A: This depends on how your county interprets West Virginia Code. Most counties require the "permanent and total" designation for the exemption, not just 100% scheduler rating. If you're 100% but it's not designated P&T, you likely qualify for the 90% credit instead, which still covers your full property tax via refund. Contact your county assessor to confirm their policy.

**Q2: I'm 90% disabled. Should I try to increase to 100% for better tax benefits?**

A: For West Virginia tax purposes specifically, there's minimal difference. Both 90% and 100% result in no property taxes paid (one via credit, one via exemption). The 100% exemption has the cash flow advantage of not paying upfront, but both save the same amount annually. Pursue rating increases based on medical reality and federal benefits (which ARE substantially better at 100%), not state tax considerations.

**Q3: Can I claim the military retirement exemption if I also receive VA disability compensation?**

A: Yes. Military retirement pay and VA disability compensation are separate payments. Military retirement income is fully exempt from WV income tax. VA disability compensation is federally tax-exempt everywhere. If you receive both, both are exempt from WV taxation.

**Q4: What if I'm rated 100% by VA but my state adjudication letter says 90%?**

A: Use your federal VA rating. West Virginia tax benefits are based on VA Combined Disability Rating, not any state-level determination. The state disability rating is for state-specific programs. For tax purposes, your VA rating letter is the controlling document.

**Q5: I'm 100% disabled and 65+. Should I apply for homestead exemption too?**

A: You can, but it provides no additional benefit. The 100% disabled veteran exemption already zeros out your property tax. The homestead exemption can't reduce your tax below zero. Save yourself the paperwork.

**Q6: Does the 90% credit apply to mobile homes?**

A: Yes. The Disabled Veteran Real Property Tax Credit applies to single-family residential houses "including mobile, manufactured, or modular home" plus surrounding land. Ensure your mobile home is classified as real property (permanently affixed to land you own), not personal property.

**Q7: I recently separated and my terminal leave extends into 2025. Do I get active-duty vehicle exemption for 2025?**

A: No. The active-duty exemption requires you to be on active duty and stationed outside West Virginia. Terminal leave is separation time. Once you're in terminal leave, you're separating from service and the exemption ends. Your vehicle will be taxed for 2025.

**Q8: My spouse is active duty and stationed in WV. I'm a veteran. Do I get active-duty property tax benefits?**

A: This is complex. If your spouse is active duty and you jointly own property, your spouse may qualify for certain active-duty exemptions, but your veteran status doesn't create additional benefits beyond the disabled veteran programs. Consult your county assessor with specifics about property ownership structure.

**Q9: Can I get the property tax credit if I live in a house owned by my parents?**

A: No. You must own the property to qualify for the Disabled Veteran Real Property Tax Credit. The law requires you to pay the property taxes on property you own and use as your homestead. Living rent-free in parents' home doesn't qualify.

**Q10: What if my property tax assessment is wrong (value too high)?**

A: File a property tax appeal with your county assessor's office. If you're 100% disabled, this may not affect your bottom line (you pay $0 regardless), but correct assessments matter for future tax calculations, home equity, and if you sell. Appeal deadlines vary by county but typically follow the assessment notice.

**Q11: Do property tax exemptions affect my mortgage?**

A: The exemption doesn't affect your mortgage balance or terms. However, if your lender includes property taxes in escrow, notify them of your exemption status so they don't over-collect monthly payments. You may need to provide documentation from the county assessor.

**Q12: I moved to WV from another state mid-year. Do I get full-year benefits?**

A: For property tax exemption/credit, you typically need to own and occupy the property for at least 6 months of the year to qualify. For military retirement income exemption, if you're a WV resident for any part of the year, that portion of retirement income is exempt. Consult a tax professional about part-year resident filing requirements.

**Q13: Are property tax exemptions considered income for VA disability compensation?**

A: No. VA disability compensation is not means-tested at 0-90% ratings, so state tax benefits don't affect it. Even at 100% with dependents (where pension programs might be means-tested), property tax exemptions are not counted as income for VA purposes.

**Q14: What happens if VA reduces my rating from 100% to 90%?**

A: You lose the property tax exemption for future years. However, if you're still at 90% or above, you can claim the property tax credit instead. Notify your county assessor immediately of rating changes. You may owe property taxes for the year the reduction takes effect.

**Q15: Can I claim these benefits if I work for the state or federal government?**

A: Yes. There are no employment restrictions on veteran tax benefits. You can work full-time, even in a high-paying job, and still claim all veteran tax benefits you're eligible for (except income-qualified programs like SCTC).

**Q16: Do these benefits apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. The property tax exemption and credit apply ONLY to your primary residence (homestead). Second homes, vacation properties, and rental properties are taxed normally regardless of your disability rating.

**Q17: What if I'm rated 100% P&T but it's for multiple disabilities combined, not one disability?**

A: That's fine. The exemption applies to your Combined Disability Rating. Whether you reached 100% through one catastrophic injury or multiple service-connected conditions doesn't matter. Your VA rating letter shows your combined rating, and that's what counts.

**Q18: I'm medically retired from active duty. Does that affect these benefits?**

A: Medical retirement status itself doesn't create special benefits, but medically retired service members typically have VA disability ratings. Your VA rating determines property tax benefits, and your military retirement income (whether regular or medical retirement) is fully exempt from WV income tax.

**Q19: How long do these benefits last?**

A: As long as you maintain eligibility. The 100% property tax exemption continues as long as you own and occupy the property and maintain your 100% P&T rating. Military retirement income exemption continues for life. Homestead exemption continues as long as you're 65+ and own/occupy the property.

**Q20: Who can help me apply for these benefits?**

A: Contact these resources:
- **County Assessor:** Property tax exemptions (find yours at taxrev.wv.gov)
- **WV State Tax Department:** 304-558-3333 for income tax questions

## How to Apply: Step-by-Step Action Plan

### If You're 100% Permanent and Total Disabled

**Step 1:** Gather documentation
- DD-214 (certified copy showing honorable discharge)
- VA rating letter explicitly stating "100% permanent and total"
- Property deed or mortgage statement
- Photo ID

**Step 2:** Contact county assessor BEFORE December 1
Find your county assessor: taxrev.wv.gov/PropertyTax

**Step 3:** Complete application
Each county has slightly different forms, but all require:
- Proof of ownership
- Proof of 100% P&T rating
- Proof of honorable discharge
- Residency documentation

**Step 4:** Submit by December 1, 2024 for 2025 exemption
Hand-deliver if possible to ensure receipt. Get dated receipt.

**Step 5:** Verify exemption on property tax bill
When you receive your 2025 property tax statement (typically summer 2025), verify it shows $0 tax due because of veteran exemption. If not, contact assessor immediately.

### If You're 90-99% Disabled

**Step 1:** Pay property taxes on time
- First half: Due October 1
- Second half: Due April 1
- Keep receipts for both payments

**Step 2:** Gather documentation for tax filing
- Both property tax receipts
- VA rating letter showing 90% or higher
- DD-214
- Form DV-1 (download from tax.wv.gov)

**Step 4:** File by April 15, 2025
Mail or e-file with Form DV-1 and documentation

**Step 5:** Receive refund
If credit exceeds your tax liability, you'll receive refund check or direct deposit for the excess

### If You're Age 65+ (Any Disability Rating)

**Step 1:** Determine if homestead exemption benefits you
- If you're 100% disabled: No additional benefit
- If you're 90%: Cannot combine with property tax credit
- If you're <90%: Yes, apply for homestead

**Step 2:** Apply between July 1 and December 1
Contact county assessor's office

**Step 3:** Provide proof of age and residency
Driver's license usually sufficient for both

Some counties require annual renewal, others make it permanent. Confirm with your county.

### If You're Receiving Military Retirement Pay

**Step 1:** Nothing required for active-duty retirees
When filing WV tax return, military retirement income is listed separately and automatically excluded

**Step 2:** Keep LES and 1099-R
Your military retirement 1099-R is coded specifically. Keep for tax records.

**Step 3:** Verify exemption on tax return
Line 10 of WV IT-140 shows military retirement subtraction. Verify it matches your 1099-R gross amount.

## The Bottom Line

West Virginia provides substantial tax benefits for veterans that translate to tens of thousands of dollars in savings over a military retirement lifetime. The combination of 100% military retirement income tax exemption and property tax relief for disabled veterans creates one of the most veteran-friendly tax environments in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Key takeaways:
- **All military retirees save:** 100% income tax exemption saves $1,000-3,000+ annually depending on retirement pay
- **90%+ disabled veterans pay no property taxes:** Via exemption or credit, doesn't matter which—result is $0 annual cost
- **Benefits can exceed $3,000-4,000 per year:** For 100% disabled field-grade officers
- **20-year savings range from $25,000 to $112,000:** Depending on disability rating, rank, and location
- **No income limits on major programs:** Unlike many states, WV doesn't means-test veteran benefits

Take action today:
1. Verify your current VA disability rating
2. Contact your county assessor if 90%+ disabled
3. Confirm your military retirement income is properly excluded on tax returns
4. Apply for homestead exemption if 65+ and under 90% disabled
