# VA Disability Rating for Agent Orange Presumptive Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Agent Orange presumptive service connection applies to veterans who served in **Vietnam, Thailand, Korean DMZ, and other qualifying locations** and develop certain diseases. For presumptive conditions, **you don't need to prove the disease is related to service**—the VA presumes the connection. The **PACT Act expanded** Agent Orange presumptions significantly in 2022, adding new conditions and locations. If you have qualifying service and a presumptive condition, file your claim—no nexus letter required.

## What Is Agent Orange?

Agent Orange was a tactical herbicide used during the Vietnam War to remove forest cover and crops. It contained dioxin, a highly toxic chemical linked to numerous diseases.

**Key Facts:**
- Used from 1962-1971 primarily in Vietnam
- Also used in Thailand, Korea, and other locations
- Dioxin remains in body for decades
- Causes cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a nexus letter?
**No**, for presumptive conditions. You only need to prove qualifying service and have a current diagnosis.

### What if I was stationed in Thailand?
Thailand veterans may qualify, but must show service at specific bases AND duties that took them near the base perimeter where herbicides were sprayed. This can require more documentation than Vietnam service.

### What if my ship was offshore Vietnam?
Blue Water Navy veterans (within 12 nautical miles) now qualify for presumptive service connection. The VA maintains a list of qualifying ships.

### Can I claim conditions that aren't presumptive?
Yes. You can claim any condition with a nexus opinion linking it to herbicide exposure. The presumptive list is not exclusive.

### What if I was previously denied?
If you were denied before your condition became presumptive, file a supplemental claim. Many previously denied claims can now be approved.

### What about children of Vietnam veterans?
Spina bifida in children of Vietnam veterans is a presumptive condition. Some other birth defects may qualify for children of women Vietnam veterans.

### What if I have multiple presumptive conditions?
Claim all of them. Many Vietnam veterans have diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions—each should be rated separately.
