**ARRT (BD) - Bone Densitometry** - Low-demand specialty. Cost: $225. Value: Limited job opportunities, typically additional duty for general rad techs.

**Bachelor's degree in Radiologic Sciences or Healthcare** - Valuable for advancing to lead tech, manager, or administrative roles. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 2-4 years. Value: Opens $90K-$130K+ management and education positions.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be brutally honest. There are civilian skills you'll need to develop:

**Civilian hospital workflows:** Military treatment facilities operate differently than civilian hospitals. Civilian radiology departments juggle insurance authorization, outpatient scheduling, and productivity metrics. Expect 2-4 weeks learning civilian workflows.

**Customer service and patient satisfaction:** Civilian hospitals obsess over patient satisfaction scores (Press Ganey, HCAHPS). Your bedside manner, communication, and patient experience matter more than in military settings. Smile, explain procedures, and accommodate patient requests.

**Electronic health record systems:** Military uses MHS Genesis/AHLTA. Civilian hospitals use Epic, Cerner, Meditech, or others. PACS platforms also vary (GE Centricity, Philips iSite, Fuji Synapse). Plan for 2-4 weeks learning curve on new systems.

**Equipment brand differences:** You may have trained on GE equipment; civilian hospitals might use Siemens, Philips, Canon, or others. The principles are identical, but interfaces differ. Ask for equipment training during orientation.

**Insurance and billing basics:** Unlike military medicine, civilian radiology involves insurance authorization, billing codes (CPT codes), and medical necessity documentation. You won't handle billing directly, but understanding basics helps.

**Continuing education requirements:** ARRT requires 24 CE credits every 2 years to maintain certification. Budget $200-$500 annually for online courses, conferences, or webinars.

**Political navigation:** Civilian hospitals have more complex hierarchies and politics than military chains of command. Learn to navigate nurse managers, physician preferences, radiology directors, and administrative staff diplomatically.
