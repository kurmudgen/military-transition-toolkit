# Minnesota Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Minnesota offers strong tax benefits for veterans, particularly for disabled veterans and military retirees. If you're considering Minnesota or already living here, understanding these benefits can save you thousands of dollars annually.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Minnesota offers veterans:

- **Military retirement pay**: Partially exempt from state income tax (varies by age and income)
- **Property tax Market Value Exclusion**: Up to $300,000 excluded from taxable value for disabled veterans (saving $3,000-$4,500/year typically)
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Vehicle registration**: Tax exemption on one vehicle for disabled veterans
- **Hunting and fishing licenses**: Free or reduced-cost for 100% disabled veterans and former POWs

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $3,500-$5,500+ depending on property value and location.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Partially Exempt

Minnesota offers partial exemptions on military retirement pay, with the amount depending on your age and total income.

**For retirees under age 65**:
- Military retirement partially exempt through the "Military Retirement Subtraction"
- Must have less than $71,970 in other income (single) or $93,260 (married) for 2025
- Specific exemption amount varies

**For retirees age 65 and older**:
- Can choose between military retirement subtraction OR the general public pension subtraction
- Public pension subtraction: Up to $6,600 (single) or $13,200 (married) for 2025
- Typically more beneficial for older retirees

**What this means**: If you retire at E-8 with 20 years and receive $35,000 annually in military retirement, you'll receive a partial state income tax exemption, but not the full amount.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $171/month for a 10% rating or $3,900+/month for 100% with dependents, Minnesota won't tax it.

### Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)

SBP payments receive the same treatment as military retirement pay - partial exemption based on age and income level.

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Minnesota operates on a progressive income tax system with four brackets:

- **5.35%** on taxable income up to $31,690 (single) or $46,340 (married)
- **6.80%** on income $31,690-$103,600 (single) or $46,340-$184,050 (married)
- **7.85%** on income $103,600-$206,700 (single) or $184,050-$304,970 (married)
- **9.85%** on income over $206,700 (single) or $304,970 (married)

**Standard deduction**: $14,175 (single), $28,350 (married) for 2025

Minnesota's top rate is among the highest in the nation, making the military retirement exemption valuable even though it's partial.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Minnesota** | Partial exemption | 5.35-9.85% | Up to $300K exclusion |
| Wisconsin | Partial exemption | 3.5-7.65% | Limited |
| Iowa | Exempt (age 55+) | 4.4-5.7% | Limited |
| North Dakota | 100% exempt | 1.1-2.9% | Limited |
| South Dakota | N/A | No income tax | Varies |

Minnesota has the highest income tax rates in the region, but compensates with generous property tax benefits for disabled veterans.

## Property Tax Exemptions for Veterans

### Special Agricultural Homestead Market Value Exclusion

Veterans with service-connected disabilities who own agricultural land may qualify for additional property tax benefits. Contact your county assessor for agricultural land exclusions.

### How Minnesota's System Works

Minnesota's property tax system is unique. The Market Value Exclusion reduces the **taxable market value** of your home, which then affects your property tax calculation.

**Key points**:
- The exclusion applies to homesteaded property only
- Maximum exclusion: $300,000 (100% P&T) or $150,000 (50-99%)
- If your home is worth $280,000, the entire value is excluded (you pay $0)
- If your home is worth $500,000, you still get $300,000 excluded (you pay tax on $200,000)

### How to Apply for Market Value Exclusion

**Timeline**: Apply as soon as possible after receiving your disability rating or moving to Minnesota.

**Required documents**:
- VA rating decision letter showing disability percentage
- Minnesota driver's license or state ID
- Property deed showing ownership
- Homestead application (if not already filed)
- Completed Application for Disabled Veterans Homestead Market Value Exclusion (Form CR-DVM)

**Where to apply**: Your county assessor's office

**Processing time**: Typically 30-60 days

**Deadline**: You can apply at any time, but applying before mid-year ensures the exclusion applies to the current payable tax year (taxes paid the following year).

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran retiring in Minnesota.

### Scenario: E-7 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $32,000
- VA disability: $43,000 (100% with spouse and one child)
- Total: $75,000

**Home**: $350,000 (median for Twin Cities metro)

### Minnesota Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax exclusion (on $300K) | $3,600 | $72,000 |
| Military retirement partial exemption | $960 | $19,200 |
| Vehicle sales tax (one-time) | $1,950 (one-time) | $1,950 |
| Vehicle registration tax | $300 | $6,000 |
| Hunting/fishing license | $50 | $1,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **~$4,910** | **$100,150** |

**Note**: This assumes constant property values. With appreciation, property tax savings would be even higher. Also assumes one vehicle purchase.

### Comparison: Minnesota vs. Wisconsin

Same scenario, but in Wisconsin (neighboring state):

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Minnesota | $72,000 | $19,200 | $100,150 |
| Wisconsin | Varies (less generous) | ~$12,000 | ~$70,000 |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exclusion every year?

No. Once approved, the exclusion continues automatically as long as you maintain your disability rating and the property remains your primary residence.

### What if I'm rated 70% disabled?

You qualify for the $150,000 Market Value Exclusion (50-99% rating category). You still benefit from:
- Partial state income tax exemption on military retirement
- Tax-free VA disability compensation
- Vehicle tax exemption

### Can I get the property tax exclusion on a second home or rental property?

No. The exclusion applies only to your primary homesteaded residence.

### What if I own a home worth more than $300,000?

You still receive the full $300,000 exclusion. If your home is worth $450,000, you pay property tax on $150,000 instead of $450,000.

### Does TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) qualify for the $300,000 exclusion?

Yes. Veterans rated 100% through TDIU qualify for the full $300,000 Market Value Exclusion.

### Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exclusion?

Yes, if they don't remarry and continue to occupy the property as their primary residence. Check with your county assessor for specific continuation requirements.

### What happens if I sell my home and buy another in Minnesota?

You'll need to reapply for the exclusion on your new property through the new county assessor's office.

### Are military retirement benefits taxed if I move to Minnesota from another state?

### Does Minnesota tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, at Minnesota's progressive rates (5.35% to 9.85%). However, if you're 65+, you may qualify for the public pension subtraction which can reduce the taxable amount.

### Can I claim both the disabled veteran exclusion and the property tax refund (circuit breaker)?

Yes, if you meet the income eligibility requirements for both programs. They are separate benefits.

## Key Takeaways

Minnesota delivers substantial financial value for disabled veterans:

1. **100% disabled veterans** typically save $3,000-$4,500 annually through property tax exclusions

4. **100% disabled veterans** get free lifetime hunting and fishing licenses
5. **Any disabled veteran** gets vehicle tax exemption on one vehicle
6. **Children of deceased/100% disabled veterans** get free tuition at state schools

Minnesota's Market Value Exclusion is particularly valuable given the state's high property tax rates. A 100% disabled veteran can save over $70,000 in property taxes over 20 years.

Combined with excellent schools, low crime, and strong economy, Minnesota offers solid value for disabled veterans despite higher overall tax rates.

If you're a disabled veteran and haven't applied for the Market Value Exclusion yet, do it today. You could be saving thousands of dollars every year.
