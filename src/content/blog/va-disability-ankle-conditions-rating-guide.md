# VA Disability Rating for Ankle Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Ankle conditions are rated under **Diagnostic Codes 5270-5274** with ratings from **0% to 40%** depending on the type and severity of impairment. Most veterans receive **10-20%** for limitation of motion. Ankle sprains, fractures, and instability from military service are common claims. Each ankle is rated separately, so bilateral ankle problems can significantly increase your combined rating. The key is documenting **range of motion limitations** and **instability symptoms**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Ankle Conditions and How Does Military Service Cause Them?

Ankle conditions include injuries and degenerative changes affecting the ankle joint, ligaments, and surrounding structures.

**Common ankle conditions:**
- Ankle sprains (ligament injuries)
- Ankle fractures
- Chronic ankle instability
- Osteoarthritis
- Tendinitis (peroneal, Achilles)
- Osteochondral lesions

**Military causes:**
- **Terrain**: Running on uneven ground, fields, desert
- **Airborne operations**: Landing impacts
- **Training**: Obstacle courses, field exercises
- **Direct trauma**: Falls, vehicle accidents, combat
- **Heavy loads**: Rucking destabilizes ankles
- **Footwear**: Boots provide limited ankle support

## VA Rating Criteria

### DC 5270 - Ankylosis of Ankle

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **20%** | In plantar flexion less than 30° |
| **30%** | In plantar flexion between 30° and 40°, or in dorsiflexion between 0° and 10° |
| **40%** | In plantar flexion at more than 40°, or in dorsiflexion at more than 10°, or with abduction, adduction, inversion, or eversion deformity |

### DC 5271 - Limited Motion of Ankle

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Moderate limitation of motion |
| **20%** | Marked limitation of motion |

**Normal ankle motion:**
- Dorsiflexion: 0-20°
- Plantar flexion: 0-45°

### DC 5272 - Ankylosis of Subtaloid or Tarsal Joint

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | In good weight-bearing position |
| **20%** | In poor weight-bearing position |

### DC 5273 - Malunion of Os Calcis or Astragalus

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Moderate deformity |
| **20%** | Marked deformity |

### DC 5274 - Astragalectomy

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **20%** | Flat rate for ankle bone removal |

### Key Points
- Each ankle rated separately
- Can have ROM rating AND instability rating for same ankle
- Painful motion supports at least 10% with arthritis

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing ankle injuries
- Line of duty determinations
- Physical profiles
- Imaging from service

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Orthopedic evaluation
- X-ray showing arthritis or deformity
- MRI showing ligament damage
- Physical examination findings

### Severity Evidence
- Range of motion measurements
- Documentation of instability
- Use of braces
- Treatment records

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Measure range of motion (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion)
2. Test for instability
3. Assess for pain on movement
4. Check for swelling
5. Test repetitive motion

**What to tell them:**
- Describe instability (giving way, rolling)
- Report where pain begins
- Mention use of braces
- Describe functional limitations

## Secondary Conditions

**From ankle conditions:**
- Knee problems (altered gait)
- Hip problems (compensation)
- Back pain (gait changes)
- Opposite ankle (overcompensation)

**Ankle conditions secondary to:**
- Knee problems
- Back/hip conditions
- Obesity
