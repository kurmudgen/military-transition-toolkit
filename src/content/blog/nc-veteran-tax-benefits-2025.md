# North Carolina Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

North Carolina's standout veteran tax benefit is full exemption of military retirement pay from state income tax—saving military retirees $1,400-$2,500+ annually. For 100% permanently and totally (P&T) disabled veterans, the state excludes the first $45,000 of home value from property taxes, saving $350-$900+ per year depending on county. Combined with free disabled veteran license plates and no highway tax on VA-adapted vehicles, North Carolina offers solid tax benefits.

North Carolina ranks in the middle tier nationally for veteran tax benefits. The military retirement exemption is excellent (full exemption for 20+ year retirees), but the property tax benefit is modest compared to states like Texas, Florida, or New Hampshire. The $45,000 exclusion helps, but with North Carolina's average 0.78% effective property tax rate, annual savings are limited unless you live in a high-tax county.

Legislative proposals could dramatically improve benefits: Senate Bill 660 (NC Veterans Relief Act) would increase the property tax exclusion to $75,000 (July 2025), then $125,000 (July 2026), and ultimately up to $500,000 or 100% of home value (July 2027). If enacted, this would vault North Carolina into the top 10 states nationally for disabled veteran benefits.

Downsides? The property tax benefit only applies to 100% P&T disabled veterans—veterans rated 50-90% receive no property tax relief. North Carolina's state income tax is 4.25% (2025), so while military retirees avoid this, other veterans pay state tax on civilian income. Sales tax is 4.75% state (6.75-7.5% with local taxes)—no veteran exemptions exist.

Overall verdict: North Carolina is excellent for military retirees (full income tax exemption) and good for 100% disabled veterans (property tax exclusion + free plates). For veterans under 100% disabled, benefits are minimal. The state's moderate cost of living and large military presence (Fort Liberty, Camp Lejeune) make it attractive despite middling tax benefits.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Permanently & Totally Disabled Veterans:**
- Exclusion: **$45,000 of assessed home value** (reduces taxable value)
- Requirements: 100% P&T service-connected disability from VA; primary residence; honorable discharge
- Annual savings: $350-$900+ depending on county tax rate (see county breakdown below)
- Alternative qualifications: Veterans receiving specially adapted housing benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 2101 also qualify

If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, the first $45,000 of your home's assessed value is excluded from property taxes. North Carolina counties assess property at 100% of market value, so this directly reduces your tax bill.

**Example:** If your home is assessed at $300,000, you only pay property tax on $255,000. In Wake County (0.5171% county rate), this saves you $232 annually in county taxes alone—more when combined with city taxes.

**Proposed Increases Under Senate Bill 660:**
If passed, the disabled veteran homestead exclusion would increase as follows:
- **July 1, 2025:** Exclusion increases to $75,000
- **July 1, 2026:** Exclusion increases to $125,000
- **July 1, 2027:** Exclusion increases to the lesser of $500,000 or 100% of the home's appraised value

These increases would transform North Carolina's benefit from modest to one of the best nationally. A $500,000 exclusion in Wake County would save $2,586 annually—over 7x the current benefit.

**Under 100% Disabled Veterans:**
- No property tax exemptions
- No partial exemptions for 50-90% disabled veterans
- Full property tax applies

North Carolina doesn't offer graduated exemptions based on disability rating. It's all-or-nothing: qualify at 100% P&T, or pay full property tax.

**Surviving Spouses:**
- Unremarried surviving spouses of eligible disabled veterans retain the property tax exclusion
- Must remain unremarried
- Applies to same primary residence

This is a valuable benefit that protects surviving spouses from property tax increases after a veteran's death.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your county tax assessor** (Mecklenburg, Wake, Durham, Cumberland, or your county)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4) showing honorable discharge
   - VA award letter showing 100% P&T service-connected disability (or specially adapted housing benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 2101)
   - Property deed showing you as owner
   - Proof of North Carolina residency

3. **File Form NCDVA-9 and Form AV-9** with your county tax office
   - **Deadline: June 1** of the current tax year for current year benefit
   - **Where to file:** County Tax Assessor's Office
   - Processing: 30-60 days

4. **Once approved, exemption renews automatically**
   - No annual reapplication required unless disability status changes
   - Notify assessor if you move to a new property

**Important:** Missing the June 1 deadline means you lose the benefit for that entire tax year. Apply immediately after establishing residency.

### Property Tax by County

North Carolina's effective property tax rate averages 0.78%, with significant county variation. The $45,000 exclusion saves veterans different amounts depending on where they live:

| County | Major Cities | Tax Rate (per $100) | Median Home Value | Annual Tax (Full) | Savings (100% Disabled) |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Mecklenburg** | Charlotte | $1.0445 | $399,000 | $4,167 | $470 |
| **Wake** | Raleigh, Cary | $0.5171 (county only) | $450,000 | $2,327 (county) | $233 (county only)* |
| **Durham** | Durham | $0.5542 (county) | $440,000 | $2,438 | $249 |
| **Guilford** | Greensboro | $0.7305 | $285,000 | $2,082 | $329 |
| **Forsyth** | Winston-Salem | $0.6942 | $265,000 | $1,840 | $312 |
| **Cumberland** | Fayetteville | $0.8080 | $225,000 | $1,818 | $364 |
| **Buncombe** | Asheville | $0.5140 | $567,000 | $2,914 | $231 |
| **New Hanover** | Wilmington | $0.5428 | $463,000 | $2,513 | $244 |
| **Gaston** | Gastonia | $0.9600 | $235,000 | $2,256 | $432 |

*Wake County cities add municipal taxes: Raleigh adds $0.3550, Cary adds $0.3400, making combined rates 0.8721-0.8571.

**Example—Wake County (Raleigh):**
- Combined county + city rate: $0.8721 per $100
- $450,000 home: $3,924 annual tax
- With $45,000 exclusion: $3,532 annual tax
- **Annual savings: $392**

**Example—Mecklenburg County (Charlotte):**
- Combined rate: $1.0445 per $100
- $399,000 home: $4,167 annual tax
- With $45,000 exclusion: $3,697 annual tax
- **Annual savings: $470**

The benefit is most valuable in high-tax counties like Mecklenburg and Cumberland. In low-tax counties like Buncombe, savings are more modest.

### Future Property Tax Benefits

**Senate Bill 660 Impact (if enacted):**

Using Wake County as an example ($450,000 home, combined 0.8721% rate):

| Current ($45,000 exclusion) | 2025 ($75,000) | 2026 ($125,000) | 2027 ($500,000) |
|------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $392 savings | $654 savings | $1,090 savings | $4,361 savings |

If the $500,000 cap is enacted in 2027, 100% disabled veterans in Wake County with homes under $500,000 would effectively pay zero property tax on their primary residence—a game-changer.

**Status:** Senate Bill 660 passed the NC Senate and is under House review as of late 2024. Contact your NC House representative to support this legislation.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—North Carolina fully exempts military retirement pay**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $1,400-$2,500+ compared to states taxing military retirement

As of January 1, 2021, North Carolina provides a 100% deduction for military retirement pay from state income taxes. This applies to all qualified military retirees, regardless of disability rating.

**Eligibility:**
- Served at least 20 years in any branch of the Armed Forces, OR
- Medically retired under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 61 (regardless of years served)

**Covered income:**
- Active duty retirement pay
- Reserve/Guard retirement pay (after 20 qualifying years)
- Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments to beneficiaries of eligible retirees

**Not covered:**
- Severance pay due to separation from service (taxable)
- Active duty pay (taxable if NC resident; SCRA protections apply if out-of-state resident)

**Example savings:**

| Retirement Pay | NC State Tax (4.25%) if Taxed | NC Tax w/ Exemption | Annual Savings |
|---------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| O-6 ($80,000) | $3,400 | $0 | $3,400 |
| O-5 ($60,000) | $2,550 | $0 | $2,550 |
| E-9 ($50,000) | $2,125 | $0 | $2,125 |
| E-7 ($35,000) | $1,488 | $0 | $1,488 |

Over 20 years of retirement, an O-5 retiree saves **$51,000** in state taxes compared to a state that fully taxes military retirement (like California pre-2022 or Virginia pre-2021).

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt federally and in all states
- North Carolina: Not taxed (federal law)

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere, including North Carolina.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- North Carolina taxation: **$0—covered under military retirement exemption**
- Federal: Taxed federally (but offset by Survivor Benefit Plan changes phasing out in 2023-2025)

Surviving spouses receiving SBP payments from eligible retirees (20+ years service or medically retired) are exempt from North Carolina state income tax on those payments.

### Civilian Income & Other Sources

- **Wages/salaries:** Taxed at 4.25% (2025 flat rate)
- **401(k)/IRA withdrawals:** Taxed at 4.25%
- **Social Security:** Not taxed by North Carolina
- **Pension income (non-military):** Taxed at 4.25%
- **Investment income:** Taxed at 4.25%

North Carolina's flat 4.25% income tax (down from 4.75% in 2024) is competitive nationally but not the lowest. Veterans with civilian employment or non-military pensions pay this rate.

**Example—Blended Income:**

Retired E-8 with:
- $40,000 military retirement: $0 NC tax (exempt)
- $30,000 civilian job: $1,275 NC tax (4.25%)
- **Total NC tax: $1,275**

Compare to a state taxing all income at 5%:
- Total income: $70,000
- Tax: $3,500
- **NC Savings: $2,225 annually**

### Tax Withholding & DFAS

**Action required:** If you're a new North Carolina resident, update your DFAS withholding to stop North Carolina state tax withholding on military retirement pay.

1. Log into myPay at mypay.dfas.mil
2. Navigate to Federal & State Tax Withholding
3. Select North Carolina
4. Enter "Exempt" status or $0 withholding
5. Save changes

Failure to update means you'll pay NC taxes unnecessarily and must file a return to reclaim the money.

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**

- **Who qualifies:** Veterans with 100% service-connected disability rating (permanent or TDIU)
- **Cost:** Free (no registration fee)
- **How many:** One free disabled veteran plate
- **Application:** Submit MVR-33A form with DD-214 and VA rating letter to NC DMV
- **Certification required:** NC Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA) must certify eligibility before DMV issues plate

**Annual savings:** Standard NC registration is $38.75 base + fees, typically $50-$80 total. The free plate saves $50-$80 annually.

**Additional Disabled Veteran Plates (Low Fee):**

- **Purple Heart recipients:** Free Purple Heart plate (one vehicle)
- **Medal of Honor recipients:** Free Medal of Honor plate (one vehicle)
- **General veteran plates:** Available at standard registration cost (31 different designs honoring various branches/units)

**Personalization:** Disabled veteran and specialty military plates can be personalized for $30 additional fee.

**VA-Adapted Vehicle Exemption:**

- **Highway use tax exemption:** Vehicles specially adapted by the VA to accommodate disabilities are exempt from NC highway use tax (3% of vehicle value)
- **Example:** $40,000 vehicle = $1,200 highway tax exempted
- **Proof required:** VA documentation of vehicle adaptation

**No General Sales Tax Exemption:**

North Carolina does not offer sales tax exemptions for disabled veterans on general vehicle purchases. The 3% highway use tax exemption applies only to VA-adapted vehicles.

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **4.75% state + 2-3% local = 6.75-7.5% combined**
- No veteran exemptions
- No disabled veteran exemptions

North Carolina applies sales tax to most goods and some services, with local counties adding 2-2.75% on top of the state's 4.75% rate. Veterans pay the same rates as all residents.

**County sales tax rates (examples):**

| County | Combined Rate |
|--------|---------------|
| Mecklenburg (Charlotte) | 7.25% |
| Wake (Raleigh) | 7.25% |
| Durham | 7.50% |
| Guilford (Greensboro) | 6.75% |
| Buncombe (Asheville) | 7.00% |
| Cumberland (Fayetteville) | 6.75% |

**No exemptions for:**
- Groceries (subject to 2% state tax, lower than general rate)
- Clothing
- Vehicles (veterans pay standard sales tax unless VA-adapted)
- Home improvements
- Electronics

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% Disabled Veteran (Wake County—Raleigh, $450,000 home, $50,000 military retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $392 (with $45,000 exclusion)
- Income tax saved (military retirement): $2,125
- Vehicle registration saved: $75
- **Total Annual Savings: $2,592**
- **Total annual savings vs. state taxing military retirement and no property exemption: $2,592**
- **Potential 2027 savings (if SB 660 passes with $500,000 exclusion): $6,486**

**80% Disabled, Military Retiree ($40,000 retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $0 (doesn't qualify)
- Income tax saved: $1,700
- Vehicle registration: Standard fee applies
- **Total annual savings: $1,700**

**Military Retiree, No Disability ($40,000 retirement):**
- Property tax saved: $0
- Income tax saved: $1,700
- **Total annual savings: $1,700**

**Non-retiree Veteran (100% disabled, $60,000 civilian job, $300,000 home in Charlotte):**
- Property tax saved: $470 (Mecklenburg County)
- Income tax: Pays $2,550 on civilian income (no exemption)
- VA disability: $0 tax (all VA comp is tax-free)
- Vehicle registration saved: $75
- **Total savings: $545** (vs. paying full property tax)

The military retirement income tax exemption is North Carolina's most valuable benefit, saving qualified retirees $1,400-$3,400+ annually. The property tax exclusion helps 100% disabled veterans but is modest unless SB 660 passes.

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled Veteran (current law):**
- Annual savings: $2,592
- 20-year total: $51,840
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $38,500

**100% Disabled Veteran (if SB 660 passes with 2027 changes):**
- Annual savings: $6,486
- 20-year total: $129,720
- NPV: $96,300

**80% Disabled Military Retiree:**
- Annual savings: $1,700
- 20-year total: $34,000
- NPV: $25,250

**Military Retiree (No Disability):**
- Annual savings: $1,700
- 20-year total: $34,000
- NPV: $25,250

Over 20 years, military retirees save $34,000+ by living in North Carolina versus states that tax military retirement. If Senate Bill 660 passes, 100% disabled veterans could save nearly $130,000 over 20 years.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $50K Retirement, $450K Home) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **North Carolina** | Exempt | $45,000 exclusion ($392 savings) | $2,517 |
| Virginia | Exempt (age 55+, phased in 2021-2025) | $10,000 exemption | $1,500 |
| South Carolina | Exempt (partial, up to $30K) | $50,000 exemption | $2,800 |
| Tennessee | No income tax | No property tax exemption | $0 (no income tax to exempt) |
| Georgia | Exempt (age/amount limits) | Up to $96,600 exclusion | $4,000+ |
| Florida | No income tax | Full exemption (100% P&T) | $10,000+ |
| Texas | No income tax | Full exemption (100% P&T) | $10,000+ |

**Verdict:** North Carolina ranks middle-tier regionally. It's better than Virginia for retirees but behind South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Texas for property tax benefits. Tennessee has no income tax, making the military retirement exemption irrelevant, but offers no property tax relief.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** Top tier—full exemption for military retirement
- **Property tax exemption:** Middle tier—$45,000 exclusion is better than many states but far behind Texas/Florida/Oklahoma/Illinois
- **Sales tax:** Middle tier—6.75-7.5% combined rate, no veteran exemptions
- **Overall ranking:** Top 20 nationally for military retirees; middle tier (20-30) for 100% disabled veterans; bottom tier for veterans under 100% disabled

Studies rank North Carolina in the top 15-20 states for military retirees due to the income tax exemption and moderate cost of living. For disabled veterans, rankings vary from top 25 to top 40 depending on methodology and whether proposed legislation is considered.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- Military retirees with 20+ years of service (save $1,400-$3,400+ annually on income tax)
- 100% P&T disabled veterans (property tax exclusion + free plates, potentially much better if SB 660 passes)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (NY, CA, CT, NJ, MA) who gain from NC's lower overall tax burden
- Families near Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg), Camp Lejeune, or Seymour Johnson AFB (military community support)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans rated 50-90% disabled (no property tax benefits)
- Veterans without military retirement income (pay 4.25% on all income)
- Veterans in high-cost cities like Asheville or Charlotte (high housing costs offset tax savings)

**Better options elsewhere:**
- If you're 50-90% disabled and want property tax relief, consider Texas (veteran exemptions at lower ratings), Oklahoma, or Illinois
- If you want zero income tax and bigger property tax breaks, consider Florida, Texas, or Tennessee (though TN has no property exemption)
- If you want the best combination of income and property tax benefits, consider Alabama, Georgia, or South Carolina

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- North Carolina estate tax: **None** (repealed 2013)
- North Carolina inheritance tax: **None**
- Veteran exemptions: N/A (no estate/inheritance taxes)

North Carolina has no estate or inheritance taxes, excellent for estate planning and passing property to heirs.

### Other Tax Benefits

**No taxes on:**
- Social Security benefits (North Carolina does not tax Social Security)
- Military retirement (qualified retirees)
- VA disability compensation

**Taxes that do exist:**
- Income tax: 4.25% flat rate on most income
- Sales tax: 4.75% state + 2-3% local
- Property tax: County-based, average 0.78% effective rate
- Vehicle taxes: Highway use tax 3% (exempted for VA-adapted vehicles)

### State-Specific Benefits

**Tuition Assistance for Dependents:**

Children of 100% totally and permanently disabled NC veterans, POW/MIA veterans, or Medal of Honor recipients may qualify for state education benefits. Contact NC DMVA for details.

**Hunting/Fishing License Discounts:**

100% disabled veterans receive discounts on NC Wildlife Resources Commission licenses.

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish North Carolina residency immediately.** Obtain NC driver's license, register to vote, file declaration of domicile.

2. **Apply for property tax exclusion within 60 days of moving.** File Forms NCDVA-9 and AV-9 with your county tax assessor by June 1 deadline to ensure current year benefit.

3. **Update DFAS withholding to stop NC state tax withholding on military retirement.** Log into myPay and adjust withholding.

4. **Apply for disabled veteran license plates if you qualify (100% P&T).** Submit MVR-33A form with DD-214 and VA rating letter to NC DMV after DMVA certification. Free plates save $75+ annually.

5. **Monitor Senate Bill 660 progress.** If the NC Veterans Relief Act passes, reapply or confirm your property tax exclusion reflects the increased amount ($75,000 in 2025, $125,000 in 2026, up to $500,000 in 2027).

6. **Contact your county tax assessor for local veteran benefits.** Some counties or municipalities may offer additional small exemptions or credits not advertised widely.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Missing the June 1 property tax deadline:** You lose an entire year of savings ($392-$470+). Apply immediately after moving.

- **Not updating DFAS withholding:** You'll pay NC state tax on military retirement unnecessarily and must file a return to reclaim it. Update withholding as soon as you move.

- **Assuming partial disability qualifies for property tax exclusion:** Only 100% P&T or specially adapted housing recipients qualify. If you're 90%, you pay full property tax.

- **Not applying for free disabled veteran plates:** 100% disabled veterans and Purple Heart recipients get free plates but must apply—they're not automatic.

- **Forgetting to notify assessor if you move within NC:** The property tax exclusion doesn't transfer automatically. Reapply in your new county.
