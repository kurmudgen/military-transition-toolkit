# VA Disability Rating for Asthma: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Asthma (bronchial asthma) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 6602** with ratings of **10%, 30%, 60%, or 100%** based on **pulmonary function testing (PFT)** results and **medication requirements**. Most veterans receive **30-60%**. Asthma is commonly claimed due to **burn pit exposure** (now under PACT Act), environmental exposures during deployment, or aggravation of pre-existing asthma during service. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Asthma?

Bronchial asthma is a chronic respiratory condition causing airway inflammation, narrowing, and increased mucus production.

**Symptoms:**
- Shortness of breath
- Wheezing
- Coughing (especially at night)
- Chest tightness
- Difficulty exercising
- Exacerbations/attacks

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- First onset during service
- Environmental exposures during service
- Burn pit exposure (PACT Act presumptive)
- Chemical exposures
- Smoke inhalation

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing asthma worsened by service conditions
- Required increased treatment after service

**Presumptive (PACT Act):**
Asthma is presumptive for veterans with certain toxic exposures, including burn pit exposure.

## VA Rating Criteria

Asthma is rated under **38 CFR § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | FEV-1 71-80% predicted; OR FEV-1/FVC 71-80%; OR intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy |
| **30%** | FEV-1 56-70% predicted; OR FEV-1/FVC 56-70%; OR daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy; OR inhalational anti-inflammatory medication |
| **60%** | FEV-1 40-55% predicted; OR FEV-1/FVC 40-55%; OR at least monthly visits to physician for exacerbations; OR intermittent (at least 3 times per year) courses of systemic corticosteroids |
| **100%** | FEV-1 less than 40% predicted; OR FEV-1/FVC less than 40%; OR more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure; OR requires daily use of systemic high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications |

### Understanding PFT Results

- **FEV-1**: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (% of predicted)
- **FEV-1/FVC**: Ratio of FEV-1 to forced vital capacity
- Lower percentages = worse lung function = higher ratings

### Medication Criteria

- **Intermittent bronchodilator**: As-needed inhaler use = 10%
- **Daily bronchodilator OR inhaled anti-inflammatory**: Daily maintenance = 30%
- **Systemic corticosteroids** (oral steroids) 3+ times per year = 60%
- **Daily systemic steroids or immunosuppressives** = 100%

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing respiratory issues
- Documentation of exposures (burn pits, chemicals)
- Deployment records to areas with environmental hazards
- PACT Act eligibility documentation

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
- Diagnosis from pulmonologist
- Treatment records

### Severity Evidence
- PFT results (FEV-1, FEV-1/FVC)
- Medication list (inhalers, oral steroids)
- ER visits or hospitalizations for exacerbations
- Frequency of steroid courses

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Order or review PFTs
3. Assess medication requirements
4. Document exacerbation frequency
5. Evaluate impact on activities

**Tips:**
- Bring list of all medications (inhalers, nebulizers, oral medications)
- Document exacerbation frequency
- Bring records of steroid courses
- Don't take bronchodilator before PFT unless instructed

## Secondary Conditions

**Asthma can cause:**
- Sleep disturbance (nighttime symptoms)
- Anxiety (attacks cause fear)
- GERD (medications, breathing patterns)

**Asthma can be secondary to:**
- Rhinitis/sinusitis (upper airway inflammation)
- GERD (reflux triggers asthma)

## Personal Statement Template

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does asthma qualify under the PACT Act?
Yes. Asthma is a presumptive condition for veterans with covered toxic exposures, including burn pit exposure.

### What if my PFT shows one result but my medication use supports another rating?
The VA rates based on whichever criteria (PFT OR medication use) results in a higher rating.

### What if I had asthma before service?
You can claim aggravation if military service permanently worsened your asthma beyond natural progression.

### Do I need PFTs for the claim?
Yes. The VA will order PFTs at the C&P exam to determine your rating.
