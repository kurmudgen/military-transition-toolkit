# Freelance Writing for Military Spouses: Getting First Clients

## Bottom Line Up Front

Freelance writing offers military spouses **$30,000-$100,000+ annually** with nothing but a laptop and internet connection. You can land your first paying client in **2-4 weeks** with no formal training. Rates range from **$0.10-$1.00+ per word** depending on niche and experience. The career is perfectly portable—clients don't know or care where you're stationed. Your military spouse experience is actually a competitive advantage in niches like military life, transition resources, government contracting, and family/parenting.

## Managing a Writing Business During PCS

### Before PCS

1. **Notify clients** about timeline
2. **Complete pending projects**
3. **Set "limited availability" dates**
4. **Save all files locally** (don't rely on cloud during move)

### During PCS

1. **Check email once daily** (manage expectations)
2. **Use auto-responder** with timeline
3. **Handle urgent items only**
4. **Accept that productivity drops—it's temporary**

### After PCS

1. **Resume work within 1-2 weeks**
2. **Reconnect with clients**
3. **Update any address/payment info**
4. **Use move as content** (if relevant to niche)

### During Deployment

Many military spouse writers find deployments actually increase productivity:
- Fewer household management demands
- More focused work time
- Solo parenting creates motivation for income

## Success Stories

**Sarah, Army Spouse - Tech Writer**
"I started writing blog posts on Upwork for $50 each. After six months and dozens of clients, I had enough samples to pitch tech companies directly. Now I specialize in SaaS documentation at $75/hour. I've worked through three PCS moves and two deployments. My biggest client has no idea I moved from Texas to Germany—they just know their documentation gets delivered on time."

**Marcus, Navy Spouse - Military Content**
"I pitched Military.com an article about spouse employment challenges. They paid $200. That byline opened doors to Blue Star Families, Military Spouse Magazine, and eventually corporate clients who wanted authentic military family content. Now I make $65K writing about something I know better than any civilian writer could."

**Amanda, Air Force Spouse - Copywriter**
"I was an English major who couldn't teach because of licensing. I took a $200 copywriting course, created three spec sales pages, and started pitching small businesses. First year was rough—maybe $15K. But I learned, improved my samples, raised my rates. Year three I hit $85K. A sales page I wrote last week paid $3,500 for two days of work."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "I'm not a good enough writer"
**Reality:** Good enough beats perfect. Most content writing requires clarity, not literary genius. If you can write a clear email, you can write content. Start simple, improve with practice.

### "I don't have expertise in anything"
**Solution:** You have expertise in military spouse life, which is valuable. You can also develop expertise—many successful writers learned their niche after starting. Pick something you're curious about and learn as you write.

### "I can't find clients"
**Solution:** Increase volume. Send more pitches, apply to more jobs, expand your platforms. Most writers give up before they've tried enough. 100 applications with 5% response rate = 5 clients.

### "Clients want to pay too little"
**Solution:** Some clients are not worth having. Learn to say no to low rates. Raise rates gradually. Target better-funded clients (SaaS companies, agencies, publications). Your first clients help you get better clients.

### "I don't have time with kids"
**Solution:** Many successful freelance writers started during nap times and after bedtimes. Even 10 hours/week can launch a writing career. Freelancing offers flexibility traditional jobs don't.

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Foundation
- **Week 1:** Choose 2-3 niches to pursue. Create writing samples (3-5 pieces).
- **Week 2:** Set up profiles on Upwork + one other platform. Create simple portfolio site.
- **Week 3:** Apply to 5 jobs per day on Upwork. Send 3 cold pitches per day.
- **Week 4:** Continue applications. Apply to content agencies. Land first client (hopefully!).

### Days 31-60: First Clients
- **Week 5-6:** Deliver excellent work to first client(s). Ask for testimonial.
- **Week 7-8:** Continue pitching while working. Expand to second niche if first is slow.

### Days 61-90: Growth
- **Week 9-10:** Analyze what's working. Double down on best client sources.
- **Week 11-12:** Raise rates slightly for new clients. Build toward consistent income.

**Realistic Targets:**
- End of Month 1: 1-3 clients, $200-$1,000 income
- End of Month 2: 3-5 clients, $500-$2,000 income
- End of Month 3: 4-8 clients, $1,000-$3,000 income
