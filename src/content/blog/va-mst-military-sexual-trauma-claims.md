# VA Military Sexual Trauma (MST) Claims: Complete Guide to Getting Help and Benefits

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Military Sexual Trauma (MST)** refers to sexual assault or harassment experienced during military service. The VA has **special rules** for MST-related claims that make them easier to prove than standard PTSD claims—**you don't need documentation from the time of the assault**. If you experienced MST and have resulting conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety), you can receive VA disability benefits. This guide covers how to file, special evidence rules, and resources.

## What Is MST?

The VA defines MST broadly:

**Sexual assault:** Any sexual contact against your will
- Unwanted touching
- Forced sexual acts
- Sexual activity when incapacitated
- Sexual activity through threats or coercion

**Sexual harassment:** Repeated, unsolicited sexual advances or sexual behavior creating a hostile environment
- Threatening career consequences for refusing
- Creating offensive or hostile atmosphere
- Unwanted sexual comments or behaviors

**MST can include:**
- Rape or attempted rape
- Forced oral or anal sex
- Unwanted sexual touching
- Coerced sexual acts
- Sexual harassment creating hostile environment

**MST affects veterans of all genders.** Both men and women experience MST, and all survivors are eligible for the same benefits and care.

## Special Evidence Rules for MST Claims

### The Challenge

MST often goes unreported during service:
- Fear of retaliation
- Shame or stigma
- Not knowing how to report
- Perpetrator was in chain of command
- Lack of support

**Result:** Service records often don't document the incident.

### VA's Solution: Relaxed Evidence Standards

For MST claims, the VA accepts **alternative forms of evidence** to establish that the trauma occurred:

**Acceptable evidence includes:**
- Buddy statements from people you told at the time
- Statements from family you told after service
- Records of behavioral changes after the incident
- Records of seeking mental health treatment
- Records of substance abuse beginning after incident
- Performance reports showing decline
- Requests for transfer or change in duty
- Journal entries or letters from the time
- Medical records showing related treatment
- Police reports (military or civilian)
- Pregnancy tests or STI testing
- Records of personal leave/emergency leave

**You do NOT need:**
- Official report of the assault
- Documentation in service records
- Court-martial or legal proceedings
- Formal complaint filed during service

### Behavioral Change Evidence

The VA specifically looks for behavioral changes that may indicate MST:

- Sudden request for transfer
- Unexplained changes in duty performance
- Increase in sick call visits
- Changes in behavior reported by others
- Substance abuse or increased alcohol use
- Depression, anxiety, panic attacks after certain date
- Relationship problems
- Disciplinary issues that weren't present before
- Requests for medical discharge
- Episodes of depression, panic, or anxiety

## How to File an MST Claim

### Step 1: Decide If You're Ready

Filing an MST claim requires discussing trauma. This can be difficult.

**You don't have to face this alone:**
- VA MST coordinators at every VA facility
- Vet Centers (community-based counseling)
- National Sexual Assault Hotline: 1-800-656-4673
- Veterans Crisis Line: 988 (press 1)

**Take care of yourself first.** There's no deadline that requires you to file before you're ready.

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

**What to collect:**
- Personal statement describing the MST
- Buddy statements from people you told
- Family statements
- Medical/mental health records
- Service records showing behavioral changes
- Any documentation you have

### Step 3: Write Your Personal Statement

You'll need to describe:
- What happened
- When it happened (approximate if exact date unknown)
- Where it happened
- Resulting symptoms (PTSD, depression, anxiety)
- Impact on your life

**Tips:**
- Be as detailed as you're comfortable being
- Include how it has affected you since
- You don't need to relive every detail
- Focus on establishing what happened and the impact

### Step 4: File VA Form 21-526EZ

File for disability compensation:
- Claim PTSD due to MST
- Claim any related conditions (depression, anxiety, etc.)
- Attach your personal statement and evidence

### Step 5: MST-Trained C&P Examiner

The VA uses specially trained examiners for MST claims:
- Examiner understands MST dynamics
- Can be same-gender examiner if requested
- Trained in trauma-informed approach

**You can request:**
- A same-gender examiner
- A support person present
- Breaks during the exam

### Step 6: VA Decision

VA reviews evidence using relaxed standards for MST.

## PTSD Ratings for MST

MST-related PTSD is rated like other PTSD:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 0% | Diagnosed but symptoms controlled with medication |
| 10% | Mild/transient symptoms, decreased work efficiency during stress |
| 30% | Occasional decrease in work efficiency, intermittent periods of inability to perform |
| 50% | Reduced reliability and productivity |
| 70% | Deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood) |
| 100% | Total occupational and social impairment |

**Many MST survivors receive 50-70%** ratings based on significant impact on daily functioning.

## Secondary Conditions

MST often causes conditions beyond PTSD that can be claimed:

**Mental health:**
- Major depressive disorder
- Anxiety disorder
- Panic disorder
- Eating disorders
- Substance use disorder

**Physical:**
- IBS/gastrointestinal issues (stress-related)
- Migraines/headaches
- Fibromyalgia
- Chronic pain
- Sleep disorders

**Each secondary condition adds to your combined rating.**

## VA Healthcare for MST

## Working with a Representative

### MST-Experienced VSOs

Some VSOs specialize in MST claims:
- Understand special evidence rules
- Know how to present behavioral change evidence
- Sensitive to survivor needs

**Ask about experience with MST claims** when choosing a representative.

## Common MST Claim Issues

### "You Didn't Report It"

**Response:** Underreporting is common due to fear, shame, perpetrator in chain of command, etc. The VA specifically allows alternative evidence because formal reports are rare.

### "No Documentation in Service Records"

**Response:** MST claims don't require documentation in service records. Behavioral changes, buddy statements, and other evidence establish the stressor.

### "You Continued to Serve"

**Response:** Many survivors continue serving for various reasons (financial, career, didn't know how to get help). Continued service doesn't disprove MST.

### Unfavorable C&P Exam

If the examiner's opinion is unfavorable:
- Review the report for errors
- Get a private mental health evaluation
- File Supplemental Claim with new evidence
- Appeal

## Appeals for Denied MST Claims

### Common Denial Reasons

**"Insufficient evidence of stressor"**
- Gather more alternative evidence
- Buddy statements, family statements
- Behavioral change documentation

**"Examiner opined against connection"**
- Get private mental health evaluation
- Challenge examiner's rationale
- Submit medical literature

**"Condition not severe enough"**
- Document impact on functioning
- Treatment records showing severity
- Personal and buddy statements

### Appeal Options

1. **Supplemental Claim** with additional evidence
2. **Higher-Level Review** if evidence supports you
3. **Board Appeal** for complex disputes

## Resources

### Crisis Support

- **Veterans Crisis Line:** 988 (press 1)
