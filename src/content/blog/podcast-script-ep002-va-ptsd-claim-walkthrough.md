[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

PTSD claims are some of the most common VA disability claims filed by veterans - and also some of the most commonly denied or under-rated. The difference between a 30% rating and a 70% rating? That's the difference between $524 per month and $1,716 per month. [pause] So yeah, getting this right matters. Let's talk about how to actually win your PTSD claim.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and I built Military Transition Toolkit to help service members navigate the VA system. Today we're diving deep into PTSD disability claims - the evidence you need, how the rating system actually works, and most importantly, how to prepare for your Compensation and Pension exam so you don't leave money on the table.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering the three things you absolutely must have for a successful PTSD claim, what actually happens during your C&P exam and how to prepare for it, and the specific rating criteria the VA uses to determine if you get 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%. This is going to be detailed, but stick with me - this information can literally be worth thousands of dollars per year for the rest of your life.

[MAIN CONTENT - 26-28 minutes]

**Segment 1: Understanding PTSD Ratings and What They're Worth (4 minutes)**

Alright, before we get into how to file and win your claim, you need to understand what we're actually talking about here - the rating percentages and what they mean financially.

The VA rates PTSD from zero percent to 100 percent, with breakpoints at 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70%. So the possible ratings are: 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%. [pause] There's no 20%, there's no 40%, there's no 60%. Those numbers don't exist for PTSD.

Here's what each rating pays monthly as of 2024 for a single veteran with no dependents:

Zero percent - you get nothing. Zero percent means the VA acknowledges you have PTSD connected to your service, but they've determined it's not severe enough to warrant compensation. You still get VA healthcare for it, but no monthly payment.

Ten percent - $171 per month. That's about two thousand dollars per year.

Thirty percent - $524 per month. About sixty-three hundred per year.

Fifty percent - $1,075 per month. Almost thirteen thousand per year.

Seventy percent - $1,716 per month. Over twenty thousand per year.

One hundred percent - $3,737 per month. That's forty-four thousand, eight hundred dollars per year. [pause] And if you're rated 100% you qualify for additional benefits like dental care, commissary access, and your dependents can potentially get education benefits.

Now here's the important part. [emphasis: "These ratings are based on the severity of your symptoms and how much they impact your ability to work and function socially."] They're not based on what happened to you. They're not based on how many deployments you did or whether you saw combat. They're based on your current symptoms and current functional impairment.

I'm going to say that again because it's critical. [pause] The VA doesn't rate you based on what you experienced. They rate you based on how your PTSD affects you right now, today, in your daily life.

That's why two veterans who both deployed to the same place and experienced similar trauma can end up with different ratings. One might be 50% and one might be 70%, because their current symptoms are different.

Understanding this is key to filing a successful claim.

**Segment 2: The Three Requirements for a Successful PTSD Claim (6 minutes)**

To get service-connected for PTSD, you need three things. All three. If you're missing any one of these, your claim will be denied. The VA calls this the "three-part test" for service connection.

**Requirement #1: A current diagnosis of PTSD**

You need a formal diagnosis from a qualified mental health provider - that's a psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, or other qualified mental health professional. They need to diagnose you with PTSD specifically, using the DSM-5 criteria. That's the D-S-M-5, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

If you're still in and you're dealing with PTSD symptoms, get seen by mental health. Get it documented. If you're already out and you haven't been diagnosed, you need to see a mental health provider - either through the VA or through private care - and get that formal diagnosis.

Here's what matters: the diagnosis needs to be from a qualified provider, it needs to specifically say "PTSD," and it needs to be documented in your medical records. A buddy of yours saying "yeah, he's got PTSD" doesn't count. Your spouse saying you have symptoms doesn't count. You need that formal clinical diagnosis.

**Requirement #2: Evidence of an in-service stressor event**

This is where a lot of claims get complicated. You need to prove that something happened during your military service that could cause PTSD. The VA calls this an "in-service stressor."

Now, the type of evidence you need depends on what kind of stressor we're talking about. There are different categories:

**Combat stressor** - if you were in combat, the VA makes this relatively easy. If you can show that you were in a combat zone or you received combat-related awards like the Combat Action Badge, Combat Infantry Badge, Combat Action Ribbon - those are CAB, CIB, CAR - then your statement about what you experienced can be sufficient. The VA assumes combat veterans experienced stressors.

**Fear of hostile military or terrorist activity** - this covers situations where you were in a hostile environment but maybe didn't engage in direct combat. Being downrange, experiencing rocket attacks, IED threats, that kind of thing. For this, you need service records showing you were in that environment, and a VA psychologist or psychiatrist needs to confirm that your claimed stressor is adequate to support your PTSD diagnosis.

**Military sexual trauma** - that's MST, M-S-T. The VA recognizes that sexual assault and harassment often go unreported, so they accept what they call "marker evidence." This can include things like:
- Statements from roommates or friends that you told at the time
- Performance decline in your records after the incident
- Requests for transfers or changes in assignment
- Medical records showing treatment for injuries or STI testing
- Reports to military police or counselors, even if no formal investigation happened

You don't need an official investigation or conviction. Marker evidence is sufficient.

**Non-combat stressor** - this covers things like witnessing a serious accident, dealing with a death of a fellow service member outside of combat, training accidents, that kind of thing. For these, you typically need more specific evidence - incident reports, buddy statements, service records that corroborate that the event happened.

**Requirement #3: A medical nexus linking your PTSD to your in-service stressor**

This is the medical opinion that says "yes, this veteran's current PTSD is related to what happened during their military service." The VA calls this the "nexus."

Often, this comes from your C&P exam - we'll talk about that exam in detail in a minute. The examiner will review your records, talk to you about your stressors and symptoms, and provide an opinion about whether your PTSD is "at least as likely as not" related to your service.

That phrase is important: "at least as likely as not." That means 50% or greater probability. The VA uses this standard because it's a lower threshold than "beyond a reasonable doubt." If the evidence is equal - could be service-connected, could be something else - they're supposed to give you the benefit of the doubt.

If the VA examiner doesn't provide a nexus opinion, or if they provide an unfavorable opinion, you can get an independent medical opinion from a private provider. This is called an IMO - I-M-O - Independent Medical Opinion. It costs money, usually around fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars, but it can make the difference in a claim.

So to recap: current diagnosis, in-service stressor with evidence, and a medical nexus linking the two. Those are your three requirements.

**[Transition statement]**

Alright, now let's talk about the rating criteria - how does the VA decide if you get 30% versus 50% versus 70%?

**Segment 3: PTSD Rating Criteria - What Determines Your Percentage (5-6 minutes)**

The VA rates PTSD based on how much it impairs your occupational and social functioning. They look at the severity, frequency, and duration of your symptoms.

Let me read you the actual criteria for each rating level, and then I'll translate what that means in real terms.

**30% rating** - the VA's criteria says: "occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, but generally functioning satisfactorily."

What that means in plain English: you have symptoms, they affect your work and social life sometimes, but you're mostly able to function. You might have some bad days, you might have some symptoms that pop up, but you're generally keeping it together.

Symptoms at this level might include: occasional panic attacks, some difficulty sleeping a few nights a week, mild anxiety in social situations, occasional distressing memories.

**50% rating** - criteria says: "occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity."

Translation: your symptoms are significantly affecting your ability to work and maintain relationships. You're not completely unable to function, but your reliability is compromised. You might miss work sometimes, you might have trouble concentrating consistently, your relationships are strained.

Symptoms at this level include: frequent panic attacks, difficulty with sleep most nights, problems with memory and concentration that affect work performance, avoiding social situations regularly, irritability that causes problems in relationships, difficulty controlling anger.

**70% rating** - criteria says: "occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood."

Translation: your symptoms are seriously impacting nearly all areas of your life. You're struggling to maintain employment or relationships. You have significant functional impairment.

Symptoms at this level include: difficulty maintaining employment, seriously strained or failed relationships, frequent panic attacks or flashbacks, severe depression, suicidal ideation, inappropriate social behavior, difficulty leaving the house, obsessive thoughts or behaviors that interfere with daily functioning, persistent danger to yourself or others.

**100% rating** - criteria says: "total occupational and social impairment."

Translation: you cannot function in society or hold employment due to your PTSD symptoms. This is complete inability to maintain work, social relationships, or self-care.

Symptoms at this level include: persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger to yourself or others, inability to perform activities of daily living including basic self-care, complete social isolation.

Now here's what you need to understand. [pause] The VA doesn't just give you 70% or 100% because you check a couple boxes. They need to see consistent evidence in your medical records and in your C&P exam that you actually have these levels of impairment.

This is why documentation matters so much. If you're having symptoms but you're not reporting them to your doctor, they're not in your records. If they're not in your records, the VA doesn't know about them. If the VA doesn't know about them, you won't get rated for them.

You might be thinking, "Jacob, I don't want to seem weak. I don't want to complain every time I see my doctor." [pause] I get it. But here's the reality - if you want an accurate rating that reflects your actual symptoms, those symptoms need to be documented. That's not gaming the system. That's making sure the system has accurate information about what you're dealing with.

**Segment 4: The C&P Exam - What Actually Happens and How to Prepare (7-8 minutes)**

So you've filed your PTSD claim. The VA has scheduled you for a Compensation and Pension exam - that's the C&P exam. This exam is absolutely critical. [emphasis: "The C&P exam is the single most important factor in determining your rating."]

Let me walk you through exactly what happens and how to prepare.

**Who conducts the exam:**

The VA will assign an examiner - this will be a VA psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health professional. Sometimes it's a VA employee, sometimes it's a contractor. You don't get to choose who examines you.

The examiner is not your advocate. They're not trying to help you get a higher rating. But they're also not trying to deny your claim. Their job is to assess your condition and provide an opinion about your diagnosis, your level of impairment, and whether it's connected to your service.

**The exam typically lasts 30 to 60 minutes.**

Here's what they'll do:

**Part 1: Review your records** - they'll have your military service records, your medical records, your VA treatment records, and your claim file. They'll review these before or during your appointment.

**Part 2: Discussion of your stressor** - they'll ask you to describe the traumatic event or events that you believe caused your PTSD. They want details - where were you, what happened, when did it occur, how did you react at the time.

This is hard. You're going to have to talk about some of the worst experiences of your life with a stranger. But it's necessary. Be as specific as you can.

**Part 3: Symptoms discussion** - they'll ask you about your current symptoms. This includes:
- Intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares
- Avoidance behaviors - do you avoid certain places, people, or situations?
- Negative changes in thinking and mood - guilt, shame, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, feeling detached from others
- Changes in physical and emotional reactions - irritability, anger, hypervigilance, trouble sleeping, trouble concentrating

**Part 4: Impact on functioning** - this is the most important part for your rating. They'll ask:
- How do your symptoms affect your work? Do you miss work? Do you have trouble concentrating? Do you have problems with coworkers or supervisors?
- How do your symptoms affect your relationships? Do you have difficulty maintaining friendships? Are your family relationships strained? Do you isolate yourself?
- How do your symptoms affect your daily activities? Can you go to the grocery store? Can you handle crowds? Can you drive without panic attacks?

**Part 5: Mental status exam** - they'll observe your appearance, speech, mood, thought processes, and behavior during the appointment.

After the exam, the examiner completes what's called a DBQ - Disability Benefits Questionnaire - that's D-B-Q. This form includes their diagnosis, their opinion about service connection, and most importantly, their assessment of your level of occupational and social impairment. That DBQ goes to the VA rater who makes the decision about your claim.

**How to prepare for your C&P exam:**

Okay, this is where I give you the tactical advice that can make the difference between 30% and 70%.

**First - bring documentation**

Bring copies of:
- Deployment orders or service records showing where you were and when
- Any incident reports or documentation of the stressor event
- Buddy statements from people who witnessed the event or who can attest to your symptoms
- Medical records from private treatment if you've seen non-VA providers
- A personal statement describing your stressor and symptoms

The examiner may not read all of this during the appointment, but it goes in your file and the rater will see it.

**Second - bring a support person if you need one**

You're allowed to bring someone with you to the exam - a spouse, family member, or friend. They can provide moral support, they can observe the exam to make sure it's conducted properly, and they can provide additional information about your symptoms if the examiner asks.

Some people feel more comfortable with someone there. Some people prefer to go alone. Your choice.

**Third - be honest about your worst days**

This is the single most important piece of advice I can give you. [emphasis: "You need to describe how you are on your worst days, not your average days."]

Here's what happens. Veterans go into these exams and they're trying to hold it together. They're trying to appear strong. They're minimizing their symptoms because they don't want to seem weak or they don't want to complain. And then they walk out wondering why they only got 30% when they're dealing with severe symptoms.

The examiner needs to understand the full severity of your condition. If you have panic attacks twice a week, tell them that. If you can't go to the grocery store without having anxiety, tell them that. If you're having suicidal thoughts, [emphasis: "tell them that."]

I'm not telling you to exaggerate or lie. I'm telling you to be completely honest about how bad it gets, including the symptoms you might be embarrassed about or reluctant to admit.

The VA can't give you an accurate rating if they don't have accurate information about your symptoms.

**Fourth - don't minimize your symptoms to avoid hospitalization**

Some veterans are afraid that if they're too honest about severe symptoms, the VA will try to hospitalize them or take away their firearms. Generally, unless you're an immediate danger to yourself or others right now, that's not going to happen. The examiner is there to assess you for disability rating purposes, not to commit you.

But if you are having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, you need to be honest about that. That's both important for your claim and important for your safety.

**Fifth - attend the exam**

This seems obvious, but I need to say it. If you miss your C&P exam without a good reason, the VA can deny your claim. If you absolutely cannot make the appointment, call the VA or the contractor immediately and reschedule. Don't just no-show.

**Segment 5: Additional Evidence That Strengthens Your Claim (4 minutes)**

Beyond the C&P exam, there are other pieces of evidence that can strengthen your PTSD claim.

**Buddy statements** - these are written statements from people who know you - fellow service members, family, friends - describing what they witnessed. For the stressor event, buddy statements from people who were there can corroborate that the event happened. For your current symptoms, buddy statements from people who see you regularly can describe how your PTSD affects you.

A good buddy statement includes:
- Who the person is and how they know you
- What they witnessed or observed
- Specific examples and details
- Their contact information

Vague statements like "John has PTSD and it affects him" aren't helpful. Specific statements like "I served with John in Iraq in 2007. On March 15, 2007, our convoy was hit by an IED and John was in the lead vehicle. Since then I've observed that John becomes extremely anxious around loud noises and avoids driving" - that's useful.

**Personal statement** - your own written account of your stressor event and your symptoms. This is your chance to tell your story in your own words. Include:
- Details about the stressor event - when, where, what happened
- How you felt at the time
- When your symptoms started
- How your symptoms have progressed over time
- Specific examples of how your PTSD affects your work, relationships, and daily life

**Private treatment records** - if you've been seeing a private therapist or psychiatrist, get those records and submit them with your claim. Sometimes private providers have more detailed notes about your symptoms than VA records.

**Lay statements about your functioning** - your spouse or family members can write statements describing how your PTSD affects you at home. Do you have nightmares? Do you avoid certain places? Are you irritable or withdrawn? Have your relationships been affected? These observations from people who live with you can be powerful evidence.

**Service records showing changes in behavior or performance** - if your performance declined after a traumatic event, or if you started having disciplinary issues, or if you started seeking medical treatment, those service records can support your claim. They show a change that corresponds with the stressor event.

All of this goes into your claims file and the rater reviews it when making their decision.

**Segment 6: What Happens After You File and How to Appeal if Denied (3-4 minutes)**

So you've filed your claim, you've done your C&P exam, and now you wait. Current wait times for PTSD claims vary, but expect three to six months in most cases. Some are faster, some take longer.

You'll get a decision letter from the VA. This letter will tell you:
- Whether your claim was granted or denied
- If granted, what rating percentage you received
- The effective date for your benefits
- How they made their decision
- Your appeal rights

**If your claim is approved but rated lower than you think it should be:**

You can file for an increase immediately, but it's usually better to wait. Here's why - gather more evidence first. Get more treatment records that document your symptoms. Get buddy statements. Then file for the increase with that additional evidence.

Or, if you think the rating decision was wrong based on the evidence they already have, you can appeal. The appeal process has several options:
- Supplemental claim - you submit new evidence and they review it
- Higher-level review - a senior reviewer looks at the same evidence with fresh eyes
- Board appeal - you can appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals

**If your claim is denied:**

First, read the decision letter carefully to understand why it was denied. Was it denied because they said you don't have a current diagnosis? Because they said there's no evidence of a stressor? Because they said there's no nexus?

Whatever the reason, you need to address that specific issue in your appeal or supplemental claim.

Most denials happen because of missing evidence. So you gather that evidence and refile.

If you're not sure how to handle a denial, consider working with a Veterans Service Officer - that's a VSO - or an accredited VA claims agent. VSOs are free. Claims agents and attorneys typically work on contingency, meaning they take a percentage of your back pay if you win.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap the key points from today.

PTSD claims require three things: a current diagnosis from a qualified mental health provider, evidence of an in-service stressor, and a medical nexus linking your PTSD to your service. Your rating percentage - 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100% - is based on how much your symptoms impair your occupational and social functioning, not on what happened to you.

The C&P exam is critical. Prepare by bringing documentation, being completely honest about your symptoms on your worst days, and describing specifically how PTSD affects your work, relationships, and daily life. Additional evidence like buddy statements, personal statements, and treatment records can strengthen your claim.

**Episode Description:**

Filing a VA disability claim for PTSD? This episode breaks down everything you need to know to win your claim and get the rating you deserve. Host Jacob covers the three mandatory requirements for service connection, the exact criteria the VA uses to rate PTSD at 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%, and most importantly, how to prepare for your C&P exam so you don't leave money on the table. Learn what actually happens during the Compensation and Pension exam, what specific evidence strengthens your claim, and the #1 mistake veterans make that results in lower ratings. Whether you're filing your first PTSD claim or appealing a denial, this episode provides the tactical guidance you need. The difference between a 30% rating and a 70% rating is over $14,000 per year - getting this right matters.

**Key Takeaways:**

- PTSD ratings pay: 10% = $171/month, 30% = $524/month, 50% = $1,075/month, 70% = $1,716/month, 100% = $3,737/month
