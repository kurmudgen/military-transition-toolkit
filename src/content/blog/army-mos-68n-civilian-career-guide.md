## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill money as a 68N:

### High priority (get these first):

**RCIS (Registered Cardiovascular Invasive Specialist)** - If you're pursuing cath lab work, this is non-negotiable. Most hospitals require or strongly prefer RCIS certification. Cost: $365. Time: 3-6 months study (many 68N soldiers pass immediately). Value: Opens $80K-$145K+ cath lab positions nationwide.

**RDCS (Registered Diagnostic Cardiac Sonographer)** - If you're targeting echocardiography roles, ARDMS certification is the industry standard. Cost: $400-$600 total (SPI + specialty exam). Time: 6-12 months. Value: Qualifies you for $75K-$125K echo positions.

**BLS (Basic Life Support)** - Required everywhere in healthcare. Get it immediately. Cost: $50-$90. Time: 4-hour class. Renewal: Every 2 years.

**ACLS (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support)** - Preferred/required for cath lab, EP lab, and many cardiovascular positions. Cost: $200-$300. Time: 2-day course. Renewal: Every 2 years.

### Medium priority (depending on your path):

**Associate's degree in Cardiovascular Technology** - Not always required (your 68N training often substitutes), but strengthens resume for competitive positions. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 2 years. Value: Satisfies education requirements for some hospitals and opens promotion paths.

**RCES (Registered Cardiac Electrophysiology Specialist)** - If specializing in EP lab work. Cost: $365. Time: 6-12 months. Value: Differentiates you for $95K-$125K EP positions.

**RVT (Registered Vascular Technologist)** - If pursuing vascular ultrasound path. Cost: $400-$600. Time: 6-12 months. Value: Opens $85K-$110K vascular imaging careers.

**PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support)** - Only necessary if working pediatric cardiology. Cost: $200-$300. Value: Niche application.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be brutally honest. There are civilian skills you'll need to develop:

**Electronic health record systems:** Military uses AHLTA/MHS Genesis. Civilian hospitals use Epic, Cerner, Meditech, or others. The logic is similar, but you'll need to learn new systems. Ask about EHR training during interviews and plan for 2-4 weeks learning curve.

**Civilian hospital protocols:** Each hospital has different policies, equipment brands, and procedural workflows. Your military adaptability will help, but expect 3-6 months adjusting to civilian healthcare culture.

**Insurance and billing basics:** Military medicine doesn't deal with insurance authorization, billing codes, or payor mix. You won't handle billing directly as a tech, but understanding basics helps. Ask questions and learn from colleagues.

**Workplace diplomacy:** Military directness doesn't always work in civilian healthcare. Nurses, doctors, and administrators have different communication styles. Learn to navigate hospital politics, especially if pursuing leadership roles.

**Continuing education requirements:** Civilian certifications require ongoing CMEs (Continuing Medical Education). Budget time and money annually for courses, conferences, or online CE to maintain credentials.

**Patient satisfaction metrics:** Civilian hospitals obsess over patient satisfaction scores (Press Ganey, HCAHPS). Your bedside manner, communication, and patient experience matter more than in military settings. Adjust accordingly.

## Bottom line for Army 68N Cardiovascular Specialists

Your 68N experience isn't just military training—it's specialized clinical expertise that civilian hospitals actively recruit.

You've performed invasive and non-invasive cardiac procedures, operated sophisticated imaging and monitoring equipment, managed critically ill cardiac patients, maintained sterile environments, documented clinical findings, and responded to life-threatening emergencies. Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of death in America—hospitals need professionals like you to diagnose and treat it.

Federal law enforcement won't recruit you like they do infantry, but **every hospital with a cardiac catheterization lab, echocardiography department, or cardiovascular clinic is hiring.** The aging population and rising cardiovascular disease prevalence mean job security and growth (3-11% projected growth through 2033 depending on specialty).

First-year income of $55K-$75K is realistic for entry-level or non-certified positions. With RCIS or RDCS certification, $75K-$95K is standard. Specialized roles (cath lab, EP lab, travel positions) pay $95K-$145K+. Within 5 years, cardiovascular technologists routinely earn $90K-$120K with certifications and experience.

Your military training satisfies most certification prerequisites. Many 68N soldiers sit for RCIS or RDCS exams within 3-6 months of separation and pass on the first attempt. Hospitals, especially VA facilities, actively recruit veteran cardiovascular techs.

You've managed higher-stress situations than most civilian hospitals will ever throw at you. Execute the plan, obtain your certifications, and transition into a stable, well-paying healthcare career.
