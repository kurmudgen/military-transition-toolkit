## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 15G Aircraft Structural Repairers—you possess one of the most hands-on, technically demanding skill sets in aviation maintenance. Your **sheet metal fabrication, composite repair, structural damage assessment, welding and riveting, corrosion control, aircraft skin repair, fiberglass work, and airworthiness standards knowledge** make you exactly what airlines, aerospace manufacturers, and MRO facilities need. Realistic first-year civilian salaries range from **$60,000-$75,000** for airframe mechanics at regional operators or MRO facilities, scaling to **$80,000-$105,000** with FAA Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) certification at major airlines. Senior structural repair technicians with specialized certifications earn **$95,000-$130,000+**. The aviation industry projects 13,100 annual openings for aircraft mechanics through 2032—you're in high demand.

Let's cut through the noise: Every aircraft that flies requires structural integrity. Skin panels, frames, stringers, doors, windows, flight control surfaces—all the physical structure you've been repairing in the Army is identical to what keeps Boeing 737s, Airbus A320s, and corporate jets flying. The civilian world pays 50-100% more for the same work, in climate-controlled hangars, with predictable schedules and union protection.

Here's your path: **FAA Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) license** ($20,000-$45,000 in training, 18-24 months, GI Bill covered) is your ticket to $75,000-$120,000+ airline careers. Your 15G experience means you'll excel in the airframe portion—you've already done the work for thousands of hours. **Composite repair certifications** (manufacturer-specific, $2,000-$5,000) add $10,000-$20,000 to specialized roles. **Welding certifications** (AWS D17.1, $500-$2,000) open aerospace manufacturing doors.

Most 15G veterans with A&P licenses land airline or aerospace jobs at $70,000-$90,000 within 120 days of certification. Major airlines pay $85,000-$120,000+ with seniority. Aerospace manufacturers (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop) pay $75,000-$110,000 for production or repair work. Corporate aviation offers $65,000-$95,000 with better schedules. Choose strategically based on your priorities.

## What Does an Army 15G Aircraft Structural Repairer Do?

As a 15G, you performed structural maintenance and battle damage repair on Army aircraft—helicopters and fixed-wing platforms. You fabricated and installed sheet metal components, repaired damaged airframe structures, performed composite repairs on rotor blades and fairings, welded aluminum and steel components, controlled corrosion, replaced windows and transparencies, repaired flight control surfaces, and ensured all structural repairs met airworthiness standards. You read engineering drawings, used precision measuring tools, operated metal-working equipment (shears, brakes, forming equipment), and documented every repair in aircraft maintenance records.

You didn't just "patch holes." You assessed structural damage, determined repair classifications (temporary vs. permanent), calculated stress and load requirements, fabricated replacement parts to exacting tolerances, performed heat treatments, applied corrosion protection, and signed off repairs as airworthy. You worked on structures where failures meant catastrophic aircraft loss.

Civilian employers need **all of that**. The physics of aircraft structures don't change between military and civilian aviation. Airlines need sheet metal mechanics. Aerospace companies need fabricators. MRO facilities need structural repair specialists. The skills translate directly—you're not starting over.
