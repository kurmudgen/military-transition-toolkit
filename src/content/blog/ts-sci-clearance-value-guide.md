# TS/SCI Clearance: What It's Worth and How to Maximize It

If you're leaving the military with a TS/SCI clearance, you're carrying one of the most valuable credentials in the job market. Companies and agencies spend $15,000-$50,000+ and wait 12-18 months to get someone cleared to TS/SCI. You already have it.

That's worth money—significant money.

## Understanding TS/SCI

### What TS/SCI Means

**Top Secret (TS):**
- High-level clearance
- Access to information that could cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security
- Requires extensive background investigation

**SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information):**
- Not a separate clearance level
- Additional handling protocols for intelligence information
- Compartmented access—need to know basis
- Requires TS clearance as baseline

**Together:**
TS/SCI means you hold Top Secret clearance with eligibility for SCI access, allowing work in intelligence community and compartmented programs.

### How You Got Here

TS/SCI typically granted to:
- Intelligence professionals (35 series, 1N, CTI)
- Special operations personnel
- Certain communications/signal roles
- Nuclear and sensitive weapons positions
- Specific billets requiring IC access

### Investigation Type

TS/SCI requires:
- Tier 5 (T5) investigation (formerly SSBI)
- 7-10+ years history covered
- Personal interviews with references
- Extensive financial review
- Foreign contact investigation
- Periodic reinvestigation (now continuous evaluation)

## The Dollar Value of TS/SCI

### Salary Premium

TS/SCI commands significant premium:

| Role Type | Without Clearance | With TS/SCI | Premium |

| Engineer | $95,000 | $145,000 | +$50,000 |
| PM | $100,000 | $150,000 | +$50,000 |

**DC area averages—other markets may be lower but premiums still substantial**

### Polygraph Additional Premium

Adding polygraph increases value further:

| Clearance Level | Typical Salary Range (DC) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| TS/SCI | $110,000 - $150,000 |
| TS/SCI + CI Poly | $125,000 - $170,000 |
| TS/SCI + Full Scope | $140,000 - $200,000+ |

### Career Earnings Impact

Over a career, TS/SCI can mean:
