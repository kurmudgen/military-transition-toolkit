# Marine Corps 0311 Rifleman: Civilian Career Transition Roadmap (2025)

Your 0311 MOS doesn't come with a civilian job title—but it comes with something more valuable: leadership, discipline, physical toughness, and the ability to perform under pressure that employers across dozens of industries need.

You may not have a "technical" MOS, but you have skills that translate to careers earning $45,000 to $100,000+. Here's your roadmap.

## Your 0311 Skills Translated

### Military to Civilian Translation

| Infantry Skill | Civilian Application |
|---------------|---------------------|
