# VA Disability Rating for Insomnia: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Insomnia is typically rated as part of an underlying mental health condition under the **General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders** with "chronic sleep impairment" as a symptom supporting **30%** or higher ratings. Primary insomnia can be rated under **Diagnostic Code 6847** (sleep disorders) at **0-100%**, though this is less common. Most veterans with insomnia should claim it **in conjunction with** or **secondary to** PTSD, depression, anxiety, chronic pain, or TBI. Sleep problems significantly affect your quality of life and support higher ratings for underlying conditions. Claims take 4-6 months.

## What Is Insomnia and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting restful sleep despite adequate opportunity for sleep.

**Types of insomnia:**
- **Acute insomnia**: Short-term, often from stress or life changes
- **Chronic insomnia**: 3+ nights per week for 3+ months

**Symptoms:**
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Waking frequently during the night
- Waking too early
- Non-restorative sleep (feeling unrefreshed)
- Daytime fatigue, sleepiness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Irritability, mood disturbances
- Impaired work/social functioning

**Military connections:**

**Direct causes:**
- Shift work and irregular schedules
- Deployments with 24-hour operations
- Hypervigilance from combat
- Sleep disruption in field/deployment environments
- Sleep deprivation during training
- Chronic stress of military service

**Secondary to service-connected conditions:**
- **PTSD**: Nightmares, hypervigilance, anxiety
- **Depression**: Sleep disruption is a core symptom
- **Chronic pain**: Back, knees, shoulders keeping you awake
- **Tinnitus**: Ringing preventing sleep
- **TBI**: Brain injury affects sleep regulation
- **Sleep apnea**: Separate but often co-occurs

## VA Rating Criteria for Insomnia

### Rating as Part of Mental Health Condition (Most Common)

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, "chronic sleep impairment" supports:

| Rating | Sleep-Related Criteria |
|--------|----------------------|
| **30%** | Chronic sleep impairment listed as example symptom |
| **50%+** | Sleep problems contributing to reduced reliability, mood disturbance |
| **70%+** | Severe sleep impairment affecting ability to function |

### Rating as Primary Sleep Disorder (DC 6847)

For primary insomnia without underlying mental health condition:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Documented sleep disorder, asymptomatic |
| **30%** | Persistent daytime hypersomnolence |
| **50%** | Requires use of breathing assistance device (more applicable to sleep apnea) |
| **100%** | Chronic respiratory failure OR requires tracheostomy |

**Note:** The DC 6847 criteria are designed more for sleep apnea than primary insomnia. Insomnia is usually better rated through associated mental health conditions.

### Best Strategy for Insomnia Claims

1. **If you have a mental health condition** (PTSD, depression, anxiety): Claim insomnia as part of that condition. "Chronic sleep impairment" supports 30% minimum.

2. **If insomnia is from chronic pain**: Document sleep disruption from pain condition. This supports both pain rating and potential secondary mental health claim.

3. **If you have sleep apnea AND insomnia**: These can be separate. Sleep apnea is rated under DC 6847; insomnia symptoms support mental health ratings.

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing sleep complaints
- Documentation of sleep-disrupting duty (shift work, deployments)
- Mental health records mentioning sleep
- Nexus to service-connected condition

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Sleep study (if done)
- Mental health evaluation noting insomnia
- Treatment records
- Medication records (sleep aids)

### Severity Evidence
- **Sleep diary** documenting:
  - Time to fall asleep
  - Number of awakenings
  - Total sleep time
  - Quality rating
- Daytime functioning impacts
- Treatment history (medications tried)

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

If insomnia is part of a mental health claim, it will be assessed during that exam.

**Questions about sleep:**
- "How long does it take to fall asleep?"
- "How often do you wake during the night?"
- "How many hours of sleep do you get?"
- "How does poor sleep affect your daytime functioning?"

**Be specific:**
- "It takes me 2-3 hours to fall asleep"
- "I wake up 4-5 times per night"
- "I average 3-4 hours of broken sleep"
- "I'm exhausted during the day and can't concentrate at work"

## Secondary Conditions

**Insomnia can be secondary to:**
- PTSD
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Chronic pain conditions
- Tinnitus
- TBI

**Insomnia can cause or worsen:**
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Cognitive impairment
- Hypertension
- Weight gain

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is insomnia rated separately from mental health conditions?
Usually no. Insomnia is typically rated as a symptom of mental health conditions. However, if you have insomnia without a rated mental health condition, you may pursue a primary insomnia rating.

### Should I get a sleep study?
A sleep study can help, especially to rule out or confirm sleep apnea. For primary insomnia, a sleep study isn't always required.

### Can I claim both insomnia and sleep apnea?
Yes. Sleep apnea (with CPAP = 50%) and insomnia (through mental health) address different sleep issues.

### How do I document insomnia?
Keep a sleep diary for at least 2 weeks before your C&P exam. Track: bedtime, time to fall asleep, awakenings, wake time, quality rating, daytime effects.
