### How to Enroll in VA Healthcare

**Online**: [VA.gov/health-care/apply](https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/)
**Phone**: 1-877-222-VETS (8387)
**In person**: Visit any VA medical center or CBOC

**Documents needed**:
- DD-214 (discharge paperwork)
- Social Security card
- Insurance information (if you have other coverage)

**Best practice**: Enroll as soon as you separate from active duty, even if you don't plan to use VA healthcare immediately. This locks in your eligibility and priority group.

**Priority groups**: Veterans are assigned to priority groups 1-8 based on service-connected disabilities, income, and other factors. Higher priority (lower numbers) get faster access to care.

## Education Benefits for Florida Veterans

### No State Tuition Waiver

**Important**: Unlike some states (Alabama, Texas, Illinois), Florida does **not** offer free state tuition for disabled veterans or their dependents through a state program.

**Example savings** (University of Florida):
- Out-of-state tuition: $28,658/year
- In-state tuition: $6,381/year
- **Savings**: $22,277/year
