# VA Disability Rating for PTSD: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is one of the most common VA disability claims, with ratings ranging from **0% to 100%** under Diagnostic Code 9411. Combat veterans with documented deployments often receive **50% or higher**. The key to winning your claim is documenting your **stressor event** (what traumatized you), getting a **current diagnosis**, and clearly describing how PTSD affects your **work, relationships, and daily functioning**. Combat stressors are automatically presumed credible. Non-combat stressors require corroborating evidence. Claims typically take 4-8 months, but well-documented claims move faster.

## What Is PTSD and How Does Military Service Cause It?

PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It's characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative changes in mood and thinking, and heightened reactions. PTSD is not weakness—it's a physiological response to trauma that changes brain function.

**Common military stressors that cause PTSD:**

**Combat-related:**
- Direct combat and firefights
- IED/explosive attacks
- Witnessing death or severe injury
- Killing enemy combatants
- Handling remains (mortuary affairs)
- Vehicle accidents in combat zones
- Rocket/mortar attacks on bases

**Non-combat related:**
- Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
- Personal assault or harassment
- Serious vehicle accidents
- Training accidents with casualties
- Witnessing accidents or deaths
- Natural disaster response
- Rescue/recovery operations
- Prisoner handling/interrogation

**Why the VA recognizes PTSD:**
The VA acknowledges that military service, especially combat deployments, exposes service members to extraordinary trauma. The VA has relaxed stressor verification requirements for combat veterans, making PTSD claims more accessible.

## VA Rating Criteria for PTSD

PTSD is rated under **38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. The same criteria apply to all mental health conditions, so understanding this is crucial.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | A mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication |
| **10%** | Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **30%** | Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events) |
| **50%** | Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships |
| **70%** | Occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name |

### Key Points About PTSD Ratings

**The symptoms listed are examples, not requirements:**
The VA can't deny a rating just because you don't have every listed symptom. What matters is your overall level of occupational and social impairment.

**50% is the most common initial rating** for combat PTSD. Many veterans are underrated initially and should consider appeals.

**70% requires deficiencies in "most areas"** (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood). You don't need all areas impaired, but most.

**100% requires "total" impairment**—essentially inability to work or maintain any relationships. This is difficult to achieve but not impossible.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Stressor Verification

**For combat veterans:**
- DD-214 showing combat deployment
- Combat Action Badge/Ribbon, Combat Infantryman Badge, etc.
- Deployment records to recognized combat zones
- Unit records showing combat operations

**Important:** If you have a DD-214 showing service in a combat zone, the VA presumes your stressor is valid. You don't need to prove the specific event happened.

**For non-combat stressors:**
- Personnel records documenting the event
- Incident reports, police reports, or military police reports
- News articles about the event
- Unit historical records
- Witness statements
- Medical records showing treatment after the stressor

**For MST (Military Sexual Trauma):**
The VA uses "markers" to corroborate MST stressors when direct evidence isn't available:
- Request for transfer to another unit
- Changes in performance evaluations
- Sudden use of leave
- Changes in behavior noted by others
- Pregnancy tests or STD tests
- Substance abuse beginning after the assault
- Seeking counseling

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA mental health diagnosis** from a psychiatrist or psychologist
2. **Private mental health diagnosis** with nexus statement
3. **Treatment records** showing ongoing PTSD symptoms

**DSM-5 criteria for PTSD diagnosis:**
- Exposure to traumatic event
- Intrusion symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares)
- Avoidance symptoms
- Negative changes in cognition and mood
- Arousal and reactivity changes
- Duration more than one month
- Significant distress or functional impairment

### Severity Evidence

**Document how PTSD affects these areas:**

1. **Occupational functioning:**
   - Jobs lost due to PTSD symptoms
   - Conflicts with coworkers or supervisors
   - Difficulty concentrating or completing tasks
   - Attendance problems
   - Underemployment despite qualifications

2. **Social functioning:**
   - Divorce or relationship problems
   - Estrangement from family or friends
   - Social isolation
   - Difficulty making new relationships

3. **Daily functioning:**
   - Sleep problems (hours, quality, nightmares)
   - Substance use to cope
   - Hypervigilance behaviors
   - Avoidance behaviors
   - Anger or irritability episodes

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The PTSD C&P exam is crucial and typically lasts 60-90 minutes. Here's what happens:

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file and medical records
2. Ask about your military service and stressor events
3. Assess current PTSD symptoms
4. Evaluate functional impairment
5. Complete a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)

**Questions you'll be asked:**

**About your stressor:**
- "What traumatic event(s) occurred during service?"
- "When did this happen?"
- "How did it affect you at the time?"

**About current symptoms:**
- "Do you have nightmares? How often?"
- "Do you have flashbacks or intrusive memories?"
- "Do you avoid things that remind you of the trauma?"
- "How is your sleep?"
- "Do you have anger or irritability problems?"
- "Have you had thoughts of hurting yourself or others?"
- "Do you feel detached from others?"
- "Do you have difficulty concentrating?"
- "Are you hypervigilant? Do you startle easily?"

**About functional impairment:**
- "How does PTSD affect your work?"
- "How does PTSD affect your relationships?"
- "How does PTSD affect your daily activities?"
- "Are you currently employed? If not, why?"

**What to tell them (be honest and thorough):**

1. **Describe your worst days**, not your best days
2. **Be specific with examples**: "I lost my job at XYZ company because I couldn't control my anger with my supervisor after a comment that triggered me"
3. **Quantify when possible**: "I have nightmares 4-5 times per week" not "I have frequent nightmares"
4. **Don't minimize symptoms**: This isn't the time to "suck it up"
5. **Mention all symptoms**, even embarrassing ones like hygiene issues or substance use
6. **Describe impact on relationships**: Divorce, estranged from kids, no friends

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- **Minimizing symptoms**: "It's not that bad, other guys have it worse"
- **Being too brief**: Give detailed examples and explanations
- **Not mentioning suicidal ideation**: If you've ever had thoughts, mention them
- **Appearing "too put together"**: Don't dress up or try to seem fine
- **Forgetting incidents**: Review your history before the exam
- **Letting pride interfere**: This is medical documentation, not a character assessment

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With PTSD

PTSD often causes or contributes to other conditions:

1. **Major Depressive Disorder** (Diagnostic Code 9434)
   - Very commonly co-occurs with PTSD
   - Usually rated together under same percentage
   - Can be claimed separately if distinct onset

2. **Sleep Apnea** (Diagnostic Code 6847)
   - Research shows PTSD increases sleep apnea risk
   - Can be claimed as secondary to PTSD
   - Rated 0-100%

3. **Migraines** (Diagnostic Code 8100)
   - Stress and sleep disruption trigger headaches
   - Can be secondary to PTSD
   - Rated 0-50%

4. **Hypertension** (Diagnostic Code 7101)
   - Chronic stress elevates blood pressure
   - Secondary connection increasingly recognized
   - Rated 0-60%

5. **GERD/Acid Reflux** (Diagnostic Code 7346)
   - Stress exacerbates digestive issues
   - Common secondary claim
   - Rated 0-60%

6. **Erectile Dysfunction** (Diagnostic Code 7522)
   - PTSD and medications affect sexual function
   - Often claimed as secondary
   - Special Monthly Compensation available

7. **Substance Use Disorder**
   - Self-medicating PTSD symptoms
   - Can support higher PTSD rating
   - Not separately rated but relevant to overall impairment

8. **Tinnitus** (Diagnostic Code 6260)
   - If caused by same combat exposure
   - Rated 10% separately

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "Stressor cannot be verified"
**Why it happens:** Non-combat stressors lack documentation
**How to avoid:**
- For combat veterans: Ensure DD-214 shows combat service
- For non-combat: Gather all possible corroborating evidence
- For MST: Document behavioral markers; buddy statements helpful

### 2. "No current diagnosis"
**Why it happens:** C&P examiner diagnoses different condition or no PTSD
**How to avoid:**
- Get private diagnosis before filing
- Ensure symptoms match DSM-5 criteria
- Be thorough at C&P exam describing all symptoms

### 3. "Symptoms don't meet criteria for claimed rating"
**Why it happens:** Underreporting symptoms at exam
**How to avoid:**
- Describe worst days and specific incidents
- Bring list of symptoms and examples
- Don't minimize or downplay

### 4. "No nexus between stressor and current condition"
**Why it happens:** Examiner doesn't connect your trauma to your PTSD
**How to avoid:**
- Clearly explain how specific events caused your PTSD
- Get private nexus opinion if needed

### 5. "PTSD attributed to non-service causes"
**Why it happens:** Examiner blames childhood trauma or civilian events
**How to avoid:**
- Acknowledge pre-service history but explain military aggravation
- Focus on how military trauma caused or worsened symptoms
- Note when symptoms began (during/after service)

## Buddy Statement Tips for PTSD

Buddy statements are powerful evidence for PTSD claims:

**For fellow service members who witnessed the stressor:**
- Describe the event(s) you both experienced
- Note any changes in the veteran afterward
- Corroborate details the veteran reported

**For family members/spouse:**
- Describe changes you've observed since service
- Specific behaviors (nightmares, anger, isolation)
- Impact on your relationship
- Before/after comparisons if you knew them pre-service

**Example buddy statement:**
"I am the spouse of [Veteran's Name]. Since they returned from deployment in [year], I have witnessed significant changes in their behavior and personality. They have nightmares several times a week, often waking up sweating and disoriented. They are easily startled by loud noises and refuse to attend crowded events. They have become increasingly isolated from friends and family. Their anger and irritability have caused significant strain on our marriage. I have personally witnessed [specific incident]. This is drastically different from the person I knew before their deployment."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** Errors in how evidence was evaluated
**Timeline:** ~125 days
**When to use:** If examiner ignored evidence or made clear errors

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Adding new evidence
**What to submit:**
- Private psychiatric evaluation with nexus opinion
- Additional buddy statements
- Treatment records
- Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)
**Cost:** Private evaluations cost $1,500-4,000 but often worth it

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex cases requiring judge review
**Timeline:** 12-24+ months
**When to use:** When other options exhausted or case is complicated

**PTSD-specific appeal tips:**
- The most common issue is underrating (50% when should be 70%)
- Request a new C&P exam in your appeal
- Get a private evaluation that directly addresses rating criteria
- Document worsening symptoms since original exam

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim PTSD without a combat deployment?
Yes. PTSD can result from any traumatic event during service, including MST, personal assault, accidents, training incidents, and witnessing death or injury. Non-combat stressors require more documentation to verify.

### What if I was diagnosed with PTSD after service?
That's fine. Most veterans don't get diagnosed until after separation. You need to show the stressor occurred during service and symptoms have been present since (even if not formally diagnosed).

### Can I get 100% for PTSD?
Yes, but 100% requires "total occupational and social impairment." This means you essentially cannot work or maintain any relationships due to severe symptoms like persistent hallucinations, complete inability to function independently, or being a danger to yourself or others.

### Will claiming PTSD affect my security clearance?
Seeking mental health treatment and VA compensation should not automatically disqualify you from a clearance. Untreated mental health conditions are more concerning to adjudicators than treated ones. The SF-86 question asks about mental health, but having a condition doesn't mean automatic denial.

### Can I claim PTSD and depression separately?
Generally, mental health conditions are rated together under one percentage using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. However, if you have clearly distinct conditions with different causes, separate ratings may be possible. Usually, claiming them together results in a higher single rating.

### What if my PTSD has gotten worse since my rating?
File a claim for increased rating. You'll receive a new C&P exam to assess current severity. Many veterans are initially rated at 50% and later increased to 70% as symptoms worsen or are better documented.

### How long does a PTSD claim take?
Average processing time is 4-8 months, but well-documented claims can be faster. Complex cases or those requiring stressor verification take longer.
