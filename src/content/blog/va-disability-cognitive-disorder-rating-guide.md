# VA Disability Rating for Cognitive Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Cognitive Disorder is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9326** (dementia due to other conditions) or as part of **TBI residuals under DC 8045**. Ratings range from **0% to 100%** depending on severity of cognitive impairment. Many veterans with cognitive issues have them secondary to **TBI, PTSD, sleep apnea, or depression**. The key evidence is **neuropsychological testing** documenting specific deficits in memory, attention, processing speed, or executive function. Claims typically take 6-12 months due to testing requirements.

## What Is Cognitive Disorder?

Cognitive disorders involve impairment in cognitive functions such as:

**Memory:**
- Short-term memory problems
- Long-term memory issues
- Forgetting appointments, conversations
- Difficulty learning new information

**Attention/Concentration:**
- Difficulty focusing
- Easily distracted
- Can't follow conversations or instructions
- Problems with multitasking

**Executive Function:**
- Difficulty planning and organizing
- Problems with decision-making
- Impaired judgment
- Difficulty problem-solving

**Processing Speed:**
- Slower thinking
- Delayed responses
- Taking longer to complete tasks

**Language:**
- Word-finding difficulties
- Problems expressing thoughts

**Military connections:**

**TBI (most common cause):**
- Blast exposure
- Head injuries
- Concussions
- The cognitive facet is one of 10 TBI facets rated

**Secondary to other conditions:**
- Sleep apnea (oxygen deprivation affects cognition)
- PTSD (concentration difficulties)
- Depression (cognitive symptoms)
- Medication side effects

**Other causes:**
- Environmental exposures (burn pits, chemicals)
- Medical conditions during service

## VA Rating Criteria

### As Part of TBI Rating (DC 8045)

Cognitive function is one of 10 facets evaluated for TBI. Memory, attention, concentration, and executive functions are rated:

| Level | Criteria | Overall TBI Rating |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 0 | No complaints of impairment | 0% |
| 1 | Mild memory loss, attention, or executive function problems without objective evidence on testing; complaints of mild loss and objective evidence on testing | 10% |
| 2 | Moderately impaired; able to perform most activities but needs occasional assistance | 40% |
| 3 | Severely impaired; unable to perform former occupational activities | 70% |
| Total | Complete cognitive impairment | 100% |

### As Separate Cognitive Disorder (DC 9326)

Using General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Diagnosed but not impairing function |
| **10%** | Mild impairment during periods of stress |
| **30%** | Occasional decrease in work efficiency, mild memory loss |
| **50%** | Reduced reliability and productivity, impairment of memory |
| **70%** | Deficiencies in most areas including thinking |
| **100%** | Total impairment including disorientation, severe memory loss |

### Key Considerations

**Avoid pyramiding:** You can't receive separate ratings for the same cognitive symptoms under TBI AND a separate cognitive disorder code. The VA will rate under one code.

**If you have TBI:** Cognitive issues are usually rated as part of TBI under DC 8045.

**If no TBI:** Cognitive disorder may be rated under DC 9326 or as part of other mental health conditions.

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Documentation of TBI event(s)
- Service treatment records showing cognitive complaints
- Before/after comparisons of function
- Nexus to service-connected condition (TBI, sleep apnea, etc.)

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- **Neuropsychological testing** (critical)
  - Comprehensive testing takes 4-8 hours
  - Measures multiple cognitive domains
  - Compares to normative data
- Mental health/neurological evaluation
- Treatment records

### Severity Evidence
- Neuropsych testing results showing deficits
- Functional limitations documentation
- Work performance impacts
- Daily life difficulties
- Buddy statements about observed changes

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**If claimed with TBI:** The TBI exam includes cognitive facet evaluation.

**Neuropsychological testing may include:**
- Memory tests (word lists, stories, visual memory)
- Attention tests (continuous performance, digit span)
- Processing speed tests (timed tasks)
- Executive function tests (planning, problem-solving)

**What to do:**
- Give your best effort on testing
- Don't try to "fail" tests—neuropsychologists detect inconsistent effort
- Report real-world difficulties you experience
- Bring examples of problems (forgotten appointments, work errors)

**Important:** Test results reflect your actual cognitive function. Malingering (faking deficits) is detectable and will hurt your claim.

## Secondary Conditions

**Cognitive disorder can be secondary to:**
- TBI
- Sleep apnea (oxygen deprivation)
- PTSD (attention/concentration)
- Depression (cognitive symptoms)
- Medications (side effects)

**Cognitive disorder may cause/worsen:**
- Depression (frustration with impairment)
- Anxiety (worry about decline)
- Employment problems

## Personal Statement Template

---

**Personal Statement for Cognitive Disorder**

I, [Full Name], submit this statement regarding cognitive impairment secondary to my service-connected [TBI/sleep apnea/etc.].

**Onset:**
I began noticing cognitive problems [timeframe] following [TBI event/development of sleep apnea/etc.].

**Memory Problems:**
- I forget [appointments, conversations, instructions]
- Examples: [specific incidents]
- Coping strategies I use: [lists, reminders, apps]

**Concentration Problems:**
- I have difficulty [focusing on tasks, following conversations]
- I can concentrate for approximately [X] minutes before losing focus
- Work/daily impact: [describe]

**Processing Speed:**
- I notice I think more slowly than before
- I take longer to [complete tasks, respond to questions]

**Decision-Making/Executive Function:**
- I struggle with [planning, organizing, problem-solving]
- Examples: [describe specific difficulties]

**Impact on Function:**
- Work: [errors made, tasks difficult, accommodations needed]
- Daily life: [driving concerns, financial management, self-care]
- Relationships: [frustration, dependency on others]

**Treatment:**
- [List any cognitive rehabilitation, medications, etc.]

I certify these statements are true.

## Buddy Statements

**Family members can describe:**
- Memory problems they've observed
- Changes in conversation ability
- Before/after comparisons
- Need for reminders and assistance
- Specific incidents demonstrating impairment

**Example:**
"Since [Veteran's Name]'s TBI/sleep apnea diagnosis, I have noticed significant changes in their cognitive function. They frequently forget conversations we've had, sometimes within hours. They have difficulty following multi-step instructions and often lose track of what they're doing. Before service/their condition, they were [describe previous capability]. Now, I need to remind them about appointments and help them manage [tasks]. This represents a significant decline from their previous cognitive abilities."

## Appeal Strategies

**If denied or underrated:**

1. **Get neuropsychological testing** if not done
2. **Challenge if examiner didn't consider all deficits**
3. **Submit additional evidence** of functional impairment
4. **Document real-world impact** vs. test performance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have cognitive disorder without TBI?
Yes. Cognitive problems can result from sleep apnea, depression, medications, or other causes.

### Is neuropsychological testing required?
For moderate-severe cognitive claims, testing provides the objective evidence needed. Mild impairment may be established clinically.

### What if I test within "normal range" but still have problems?
"Normal" on testing doesn't preclude impairment. Document your baseline (education, prior career) and show decline from YOUR normal.

### Can cognitive problems be secondary to sleep apnea?
Yes. Sleep apnea causes oxygen desaturation that affects brain function. This is a recognized secondary connection.
