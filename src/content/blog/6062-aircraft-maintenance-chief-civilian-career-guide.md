## Your path to FAA A&P certification as a 6062

As a senior maintenance chief with 12-20 years hands-on experience, you have multiple paths to A&P:

### Option 1: Experience-based FAA testing (fastest for 6062s)

**Process:**
1. Gather documented proof of your military maintenance experience (training records, evaluations, MOS school certificates)
2. Contact local FAA FSDO and request FAA Form 8610-2 (Application for Mechanic Certificate)
3. FSDO evaluates your documented experience against FAA requirements (30 months in airframe OR powerplant, or 18 months in both)
4. If approved, you're authorized to take FAA written, oral, and practical exams
5. Pass exams and receive A&P certificate

**Time:** 2-6 months (depending on FSDO processing and exam scheduling)
**Cost:** $500-$2,000 (study materials, exam fees, possible short prep course)
**Success rate:** High for 6062s with well-documented experience

**Reality check:** Many 6062s qualify through this path. Your challenge is documenting the breadth of your experience. Get letters from former commanding officers, copies of training certificates, MOS school documentation, and detailed description of duties performed.

### Option 2: Abbreviated FAA Part 147 school

**Process:**
If FSDO determines you need additional documented experience in specific areas, some schools offer shortened programs filling gaps.

**Time:** 3-12 months depending on credited experience
**Cost:** $5,000-$20,000 (GI Bill may cover)
**Outcome:** School provides documentation and prepares you for FAA exams

### Option 3: Full Part 147 school (if experience doesn't qualify)

**Time:** 12-24 months
**Cost:** $15,000-$40,000 (GI Bill covers)
**Outcome:** Eligible for A&P testing upon graduation

**Recommendation for 6062s:** Start with Option 1. With 12-20 years documented Marine aviation maintenance, you likely qualify to test without school. Even if you need some additional prep, it's far faster and cheaper than full school.
