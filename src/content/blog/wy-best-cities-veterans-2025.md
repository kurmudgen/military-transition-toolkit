# Best Cities for Veterans in Wyoming 2025: Cost of Living & Benefits

## Bottom Line Up Front

Wyoming's best cities for veterans prioritize different needs: **Cheyenne** (#1) offers VA medical center access, state capital employment, and reasonable cost of living ($350K median home price); **Casper** (#2) balances affordability ($290K median), VA clinic access, and energy sector jobs; **Laramie** (#3) provides college-town amenities and University of Wyoming education benefits but higher housing ($405K). Wyoming's cities are small (largest is Cheyenne at ~65,000), so expect limited urban amenities but exceptional outdoor recreation, low crime, and tight-knit veteran communities. Avoid Jackson unless you're wealthy (median home $2.4M+) or have remote income. Best overall: Cheyenne for most veterans, Gillette for energy sector jobs, Sheridan for retirees prioritizing healthcare access and small-town living.

**Quick Rankings:**
1. **Cheyenne** - VA access, jobs, affordability
2. **Casper** - Best value, growing economy
3. **Laramie** - Education, college town
4. **Gillette** - Highest-paying jobs, energy sector
5. **Sheridan** - Retiree-friendly, VA access
6. **Rock Springs** - Affordable, energy jobs
7. **Jackson** - Avoid unless wealthy (tourism sector only realistic option)

## Understanding Wyoming: What Veterans Need to Know

### The Reality of Small-Town Wyoming

**Population Context:**
- **Wyoming:** 580,000 (smallest population of any state)
- **Cheyenne (largest city):** ~65,000
- **Casper (2nd largest):** ~59,000
- **Laramie (3rd largest):** ~32,000

**What This Means:**
- Even Cheyenne feels like a mid-sized town compared to urban areas
- No major league sports, limited nightlife, fewer shopping options
- Everyone knows everyone (or knows someone who knows them)
- Strong sense of community and neighbor-helping-neighbor culture
- Extremely low crime in most cities

**Trade-Offs:**
- **You Gain:** Safety, outdoor recreation, clean air, low stress, tight community
- **You Lose:** Urban amenities, diversity, anonymity, job variety, specialty shopping

### Wyoming's Veteran Population

**42,000+ veterans** live in Wyoming, representing **9.4% of the adult population**—the **2nd-highest percentage** in the nation.

**Veteran Concentration by City:**
- Cheyenne: ~8,500 veterans (F.E. Warren AFB, state capital)
- Casper: ~4,800 veterans
- Laramie: ~2,000 veterans
- Gillette: ~1,800 veterans
- Sheridan: ~1,500 veterans

**What This Means:** You'll find established veteran communities, multiple American Legion/VFW posts, and employers who understand military experience.

### Climate Reality Check

**Wyoming Weather is Harsh:**
- **Winter:** November-March, temperatures often 0-30°F, frequent snow
- **Wind:** Wyoming is windy year-round (especially Cheyenne, Laramie, Rawlins)
- **Summer:** June-August, 70-90°F, low humidity, pleasant
- **Elevation:** Most cities 4,000-7,000 feet (altitude adjustment takes 2-4 weeks)

**Veteran Considerations:**
- If you have respiratory issues (from burn pits, etc.), altitude may be challenging
- Winter driving can be treacherous (4WD/AWD strongly recommended)
- Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) can affect some veterans—talk to VA about light therapy
- Dry climate is excellent for joint pain, allergies, and mold sensitivities

## #1: Cheyenne - Best Overall for Veterans

### Overview

**Population:** ~65,000 (metro ~100,000)
**Elevation:** 6,062 feet

F.E. Warren Air Force Base brings an active-duty military community, creating a strong military culture.

### Cost of Living

## #3: Laramie - Best for Education & College Town Amenities

### Overview

**Population:** ~32,000 (plus ~12,000 UW students)
**Elevation:** 7,165 feet (highest on this list)
**County:** Albany County
**Veteran Population:** ~2,000 (6% of population)

**Why #3:**
Laramie is home to the **University of Wyoming**, making it the best choice for veterans pursuing higher education. College-town amenities (diverse dining, cultural events, younger demographic) set Laramie apart from other Wyoming cities. However, high elevation and higher housing costs are trade-offs.

### Cost of Living

**Median Home Price:** $405,000 - $426,000 (2024)
**Median Rent (1-BR):** $675/month (affordable due to student housing supply)
**Median Rent (2-BR):** $1,200/month
**Median Household Income:** $55,000 (estimated, skewed by student population)

**Cost of Living Index:** 92 (8% below national average overall)

- Utilities: 11% below national average

**Property Tax (Veterans):**
- Albany County effective rate: ~0.60%
- $405,000 home: ~$2,430/year before exemption
- After $6,000 veteran exemption: ~$2,070/year (~$173/month)

**The Verdict:** Laramie is expensive for homebuyers (college town demand drives prices), but renters find good deals due to abundant student housing.

## #4: Gillette - Best for High-Paying Energy Jobs

### Overview

**Population:** ~33,000
**Elevation:** 4,550 feet
**County:** Campbell County
**Veteran Population:** ~1,800 (5.4% of population)

**Why #4:**
Gillette is the **coal capital of America** and a major hub for oil and gas. If you're a veteran with mechanical, equipment operator, logistics, or safety skills, Gillette offers the **highest wages** in Wyoming. Trade-off: Gillette is remote, boom-bust economy, and limited VA access.

### Cost of Living

**Median Home Price:** $300,000 (estimated 2024)
**Median Rent (2-BR):** ~$1,100/month
**Median Household Income:** $75,000+ (energy wages are high)

- Campbell County effective rate: 0.47% (lowest in Wyoming)
- $300,000 home: ~$1,410/year before exemption
- After $6,000 veteran exemption: ~$1,128/year (~$94/month)

**Nearest VA Care:**
- **Sheridan VA Medical Center:** 70 miles north (~1 hour 10 minutes)
- **Cheyenne VA Medical Center:** 250 miles south (~3.5 hours)

**PROS:**
✅ **Highest wages** in Wyoming (energy sector jobs $65K-$95K)
✅ Lowest property tax rate (0.47%)

## #7: Jackson - Avoid Unless Wealthy

### Overview

**Population:** ~10,000
**Elevation:** 6,237 feet
**County:** Teton County

**Why #7 (Dead Last):**
Jackson (Jackson Hole) is one of the **most expensive real estate markets in America**. Median home prices exceed **$2.4 million**, and the cost of living is **80% above the national average**. Unless you're independently wealthy or have high remote income, Jackson is financially unfeasible for most veterans.

### Cost of Living

**Median Home Price:** $2,400,000 - $7,000,000+ (yes, you read that right)
**Median Rent (1-BR):** $2,000+/month (if you can find one)
**Cost of Living Index:** 181 (81% above national average)

**Property Tax (Veterans):**
Even with the $6,000 veteran exemption, property taxes on a $2.4M home are **astronomical** (~$13,000+/year).

### VA Healthcare Access

**No VA Facility.**

**Nearest VA Care:**
- Cheyenne VA: 400+ miles (6+ hours)
- Idaho Falls, ID: 90 miles (closer, but no VA Medical Center there either)

### Employment Opportunities

**Tourism & Hospitality:**
- Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (ski resort)
- Grand Teton National Park
- Hotels, restaurants, outfitters

**Salary Range:** $35,000 - $60,000 (service jobs)

**Reality:** Jackson's economy is tourism-based, offering low wages while housing costs are extreme. This creates a **severe mismatch**—you cannot afford to live in Jackson on a tourism salary.

**Who Lives Here:**
- Wealthy retirees
- Remote tech workers earning $150K+
- Trust fund beneficiaries
- Seasonal workers living 4+ roommates deep

### Quality of Life

**Outdoor Recreation:**

❌ Cost of living 80% above national average
❌ No VA facility (400+ miles to Cheyenne)
❌ Low-wage tourism jobs cannot support cost of living
❌ Severe housing shortage

### Best For

- Wealthy veterans (independently wealthy, high remote income $150K+)
- Veterans who already own property in Jackson
- Veterans seeking seasonal work + living in a van (seriously, this is common)

### Reality Check

**Do NOT move to Jackson unless:**

2. You are independently wealthy

Jackson is beautiful but financially crushing for average veterans.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### General Questions

**Q: Which Wyoming city is best for veterans overall?**
A: **Cheyenne** for most veterans. It offers the best combination of VA healthcare access, employment (government, military base), affordability, and amenities. **Casper** is a close second if you prioritize affordability over full VA access.

**Q: I'm retiring from the military and need regular VA care. Where should I live?**
A: **Cheyenne** or **Sheridan**. Both have VA medical centers. Cheyenne offers more services and is a larger facility, but Sheridan is smaller, quieter, and ideal for retirees prioritizing quality of life.

**Q: I want to use my GI Bill. Where should I go?**
A: **Laramie** (University of Wyoming). UW offers in-state tuition for GI Bill users, 8 semesters of free tuition for overseas combat veterans, and a Veterans Services Center. Laramie is the clear choice for student veterans.

**Q: I want the highest-paying jobs. Where should I move?**
A: **Gillette** or **Casper**. Both are energy sector hubs with jobs paying $65K-$95K for equipment operators, mechanics, and safety professionals. Gillette has slightly higher wages; Casper has better VA access and more amenities.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled and need frequent VA care. Where should I live?**
A: **Cheyenne**. The Cheyenne VA Medical Center offers the most comprehensive services. Living in Cheyenne eliminates long-distance travel for appointments.

**Q: Which city is most affordable?**
A: **Rock Springs** ($250K-$280K median home price) followed by **Casper** ($290K). Both offer significantly lower housing costs than Cheyenne or Laramie.

**Q: I'm a hunter and angler. Which city is best?**
A: **Gillette** (access to Bighorn Mountains, Thunder Basin, Powder River Basin for elk, mule deer, pronghorn) or **Sheridan** (Bighorn Mountains, Tongue River). Casper also offers world-class fishing (North Platte River).

**Q: Are there any Wyoming cities I should avoid?**
A: **Jackson** unless you're wealthy. The cost of living and housing prices ($2.4M+ median home) are prohibitive for most veterans. Rock Springs has higher crime and limited amenities, making it less appealing unless maximum affordability is your priority.

### Cost of Living Questions

**Q: Can I afford to buy a home in Wyoming on military retirement pay?**
A: Yes, in most cities. A $60,000/year military retirement combined with a working spouse can afford a $300K-$400K home in Casper, Gillette, or Cheyenne. VA home loans (0% down, no PMI) make homeownership accessible. Avoid Jackson.

**Q: How much do I save with Wyoming's zero income tax?**
A: An O-5 retiree ($65K/year retirement pay) saves approximately **$9,000/year** compared to states with 6-7% income tax. Over 20 years, that's **$180,000**.

**Q: Are groceries and gas more expensive in Wyoming?**
A: Groceries are **1-2% below** the national average. Gas prices are slightly **below** or on par with the national average (Wyoming produces oil, so gas is competitive). Rural areas may have slightly higher prices due to transportation costs.

**Q: What about healthcare costs (non-VA)?**
A: Healthcare costs in Wyoming are **slightly below** the national average. If you have a spouse or dependents using civilian healthcare, costs are reasonable.

### Lifestyle Questions

**Q: I'm from a big city (LA, NYC, Atlanta). Will I hate Wyoming?**
A: Possibly. Wyoming's largest city (Cheyenne) has 65,000 people. If you need urban energy, diversity, nightlife, and culture, Wyoming will feel isolating. However, many veterans find the slower pace, outdoor access, and safety a welcome change. **Visit first** before committing.

**Q: Is Wyoming really that windy?**
A: **Yes.** Cheyenne, Laramie, and Rawlins are notoriously windy (15-30 mph sustained winds are common). Casper, Gillette, and Sheridan are less windy but still experience wind. If you hate wind, Wyoming may not be for you.

**Q: Can I find diverse food and culture in Wyoming?**
A: Limited. Laramie has the most diverse dining due to UW. Cheyenne and Casper have basic ethnic food options (Mexican, Chinese, Thai). Wyoming is overwhelmingly white (84%), so cultural diversity is minimal compared to urban states.

**Q: Are Wyoming residents friendly to veterans?**
A: **Extremely.** Wyoming has the 2nd-highest veteran population percentage in the nation (9.4%). Residents understand and respect military service. You'll find strong veteran communities in every city.

**Q: What if I need specialized medical care (cardiology, oncology)?**
A: Cheyenne VA offers cardiology and some specialties. For complex care, you'll travel to **Denver VA Medical Center** (100 miles from Cheyenne) or **Fort Meade VA** (South Dakota). Wyoming's VA system uses Community Care for specialists not available locally.

### Employment Questions

**Q: Can I find remote work and live in Wyoming?**
A: Absolutely. Wyoming's low cost of living and zero income tax make it ideal for remote workers. Ensure reliable internet (Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie, and Gillette have good broadband; rural areas may have limited options).

**Q: Do Wyoming employers value military experience?**
A: Generally, yes. Government and energy sector employers actively recruit veterans. Use your DD-214 on applications, translate your MOS to civilian terms, and leverage the 5-point veteran hiring preference for state jobs.

**Q: What if I can't find a job?**
A: Contact **Wyoming Department of Workforce Services** (1-800-442-2766) for free career counseling, resume help, and job referrals. Veterans receive Priority of Service. Consider vocational training using GI Bill or **Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)** if you have a service-connected disability.

## Conclusion: Wyoming's Unique Value for Veterans

Wyoming is not for everyone. The cities are small, winters are harsh, and distances are vast. But for veterans who value:
- **Financial freedom** (zero income tax, affordable housing)
- **Outdoor recreation** (hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing)
- **Safety and community** (low crime, tight-knit veteran populations)
- **Space and solitude** (low population density, open landscapes)

...Wyoming offers a quality of life few states can match.

**Cheyenne** stands out as the best overall choice for most veterans, balancing VA access, employment, and affordability. **Casper** offers unbeatable value for those prioritizing homeownership and energy sector careers. **Laramie** is the clear winner for student veterans.

**The Bottom Line:** Visit before you move. Spend a week in January (winter) and a week in July (summer) to experience Wyoming's extremes. Talk to local veterans at American Legion or VFW posts. Drive the distances between cities and VA facilities. Then decide if Wyoming's unique lifestyle aligns with your priorities.

For the right veteran, Wyoming is paradise. For others, it's too remote and harsh. Know yourself, do your research, and make an informed decision.

Welcome to Wyoming—or as locals say, "Forever West."
