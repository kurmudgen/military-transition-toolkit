# How to Negotiate Remote Work Accommodation as a Military Spouse

## Bottom Line Up Front

Remote work can solve the military spouse career challenge—but not every job is advertised as remote. Many positions **can become remote** if you negotiate effectively. This guide provides **scripts, strategies, and timing** for requesting remote work accommodation, whether during the hiring process or in your current role. Learn how to make a business case, handle objections, and structure agreements that protect your career through PCS moves.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

You've found a great job, but it's not listed as remote. Or you're in a position you love and facing a PCS. The traditional answer was: find a new job.

**The Better Answer:** Negotiate remote work.

Post-pandemic, remote work is more accepted than ever. Many employers who never considered it are now open to flexible arrangements. Your job is to make the business case.

## When to Negotiate Remote Work

### During the Hiring Process

**Best Timing:**
- After they've decided they want you (offer stage)
- During initial discussions if role seems potentially remote
- When asked about your requirements

**Not Ideal:**
- First interview (too early, unless role is clearly remote-capable)
- After accepting without discussion (harder to change)

### In Your Current Role

**Best Timing:**
- After strong performance review
- When you have leverage (valued employee, hard to replace)
- When facing PCS (with advance notice)
- When company is considering remote policies

**Not Ideal:**
- During performance issues
- With no track record
- Without preparation

### When Facing PCS

**Best Approach:**
- Give maximum possible notice (6+ months ideal)
- Propose specific solutions
- Be prepared with full transition plan
- Have backup options if denied

## Making the Business Case

### Frame It Around Business Value

**Don't Focus On:** Your personal needs (though valid)
**Focus On:** What the company gains

**Business Benefits of Your Remote Work:**
- Retain experienced, trained employee (hiring costs $4,000-20,000+)
- No productivity loss during transition
- Continued institutional knowledge
- Demonstrated loyalty increases commitment
- Flexibility attracts/retains talent

### Research and Preparation

**Before Asking, Know:**
- Company's current remote work policies
- Precedents (do others work remotely?)
- Your role's remote-capability
- Technology requirements
- How you'll demonstrate productivity

**Prepare:**
- Your track record of results
- How you'll maintain communication
- Proposed schedule and availability
- Technology/workspace setup
- Trial period if helpful

## Scripts for Different Situations

### Script 1: During Job Offer Negotiation

**Scenario:** You've received an offer for an in-office position you want.

**Script:**
"Thank you so much for this offer—I'm excited about the opportunity to join [Company] and contribute to [specific project/goal]. I wanted to discuss something that's important for my long-term success in this role.

As a military spouse, I relocate periodically based on my spouse's assignments. I'm committed to building a career with [Company], and I want to set us both up for success from the start. Would the company be open to discussing remote work flexibility, either now or as something we could transition to in the future if I need to relocate?

I'm confident I can deliver strong results remotely. I have [experience working independently/remotely/delivering results]. I'm happy to discuss how we could structure this to meet the team's needs."

### Script 2: Current Role - Planning Ahead

**Scenario:** You're established in your role and want to set up remote work before you need it.

**Script:**
"I wanted to bring something to your attention proactively. As you know, I'm a military spouse, and while we don't have orders yet, we'll likely relocate within the next [timeframe].

I value my role here and want to continue contributing to the team. I'd like to discuss the possibility of transitioning to remote work when that happens. I've thought about how this would work and have some ideas I'd like to share.

Given my track record—[specific accomplishments]—I'm confident I can maintain the same level of performance remotely. Would you be open to discussing what this might look like?"

### Script 3: Facing Imminent PCS

**Scenario:** You've received PCS orders and need to discuss options.

**Script:**
"I need to share some news. My spouse has received orders, and we'll be relocating to [location] in [timeframe]. I want to be transparent with you because I value this position and our working relationship.

Before assuming I need to resign, I wanted to explore whether there's a path to continue in my role remotely. I've been thinking about this and have a proposal for how it could work effectively.

Would you be willing to discuss this possibility? I understand it may require approvals, but I wanted to have this conversation rather than simply assume it's not an option."

### Script 4: Trial Period Proposal

**Scenario:** Employer is hesitant; you want to reduce their risk.

**Script:**
"I understand there may be concerns about remote work for this role. What if we approached it as a trial period?

I'm proposing we try remote work for [90 days]. During that time, I'll [specific commitments—availability, communication, deliverables]. At the end of the trial, we evaluate whether it's working for both of us.

This way, you're not making a permanent commitment, and I have the opportunity to demonstrate that I can deliver the same results remotely. Does that seem like a reasonable approach?"

## Handling Common Objections

### Objection: "This role isn't remote-capable"

**Response:**
"I understand that concern. I've thought about which aspects of my role truly require in-person presence versus what can be done effectively from anywhere. [Specific breakdown].

For the in-person elements, here's how I'd propose handling them: [solutions—travel for key meetings, local contractor for physical tasks, etc.].

Would you be open to discussing which specific functions concern you most?"

### Objection: "We've never done this before"

**Response:**
"I understand I'd be setting a new precedent. I want to assure you that this is specifically related to military spouse relocation—not a general policy change.

I'm proposing this because of my specific situation and track record. My performance has been [specific evidence], and I'm committed to maintaining that standard.

If it helps, we could structure this with clear performance metrics and regular check-ins. Would that make you more comfortable?"

### Objection: "What about team collaboration?"

**Response:**
"That's an important consideration. Here's how I'd maintain collaboration:

- [Daily/weekly] video check-ins with the team
- Available during core hours [time zone adjustment if needed]
- Responsive on [Slack/Teams/email] throughout the day
- Travel for [quarterly meetings/annual events/critical projects]

I'm committed to not being 'out of sight, out of mind.' I'll actually need to be more proactive about communication, and I'm prepared to do that."

### Objection: "Management won't approve this"

**Response:**
"I appreciate you sharing that. Would it be helpful if I put together a formal proposal that you could present to management? I can address the business case, productivity commitments, and risk mitigation.

I want to make it easy for you to advocate for this if you're willing. What information would be most helpful for that conversation?"

### Objection: "We need you here for [specific reason]"

**Response:**
"I understand [specific reason] is important. Let me address that directly.

[Specific solution for their concern—e.g., 'For client meetings, I can fly in quarterly and be available by video for others' or 'For the equipment monitoring, here's a technology solution that would work.']

Does that address the concern, or are there other specific situations I should think through?"

## Structuring the Agreement

### What to Include

**Written Agreement Should Cover:**
- Effective date and any trial period
- Work schedule and availability expectations
- Communication requirements
- Performance metrics
- Equipment/technology provisions
- Travel requirements and reimbursement
- Review dates
- What happens if arrangement isn't working

### Sample Agreement Points

"We agree to the following remote work arrangement:

**Duration:** This arrangement will begin [date] and continue indefinitely, subject to satisfactory performance and business needs.

**Schedule:** Employee will be available during core hours of [times] [time zone]. Employee will maintain flexible schedule outside core hours as needed for role.

**Communication:** Employee will participate in [daily standup/weekly team meeting] and respond to messages within [timeframe] during work hours.

**Performance:** Employee will maintain current performance standards as measured by [specific metrics]. Regular reviews will occur [quarterly].

**Equipment:** Company will provide [laptop, software, etc.]. Employee is responsible for [internet, workspace].

**Travel:** Employee will travel to [headquarters/events] [quarterly/as needed], with company covering travel expenses.

**Review:** This arrangement will be formally reviewed [90 days/6 months] from start date and annually thereafter."

## Special Considerations

### Time Zone Management

**If Moving to Different Time Zone:**
- Propose overlap hours
- Address meeting attendance
- Be realistic about challenges
- Consider shifting your schedule partially

**Script:**
"The time difference is [X hours]. I'm proposing to work [adjusted hours] to maintain [X hours] of overlap with the team. For meetings outside those hours, I'm willing to flex my schedule."

### International (OCONUS) Relocation

**Additional Challenges:**
- Significant time zone differences
- Tax and legal complications
- Internet reliability
- Security concerns (some roles)

**Approach:**
- Be upfront about OCONUS orders
- Research legal/tax implications for company
- Propose solutions for concerns
- Accept that some roles truly can't go OCONUS

### Hybrid Arrangements

**If Full Remote Isn't Possible:**
- Propose hybrid (some days remote)
- May work for shorter-distance PCS
- Could involve commuting to office weekly
- Trial before PCS to prove concept

## If They Say No

### Immediate Response

**Stay Professional:**
"I appreciate you considering my request and explaining the constraints. I understand this may not work for the role as currently structured.

Can I ask what would need to change for remote work to be possible in the future? I'm committed to contributing here and want to understand my options."

### Evaluate Your Options

**Consider:**
- Is it worth staying until PCS forces decision?
- Can you transfer to different role that allows remote?
- Should you start job searching for remote-first opportunities?
- Are there other accommodations (contract work, reduced schedule)?

### Maintain the Relationship

Even if you leave:

*Remote work isn't always advertised—sometimes you have to ask for it. Approach the conversation professionally, make the business case, and propose specific solutions. The worst outcome is a 'no,' and even then, you've learned valuable information about your options. Many military spouses have successfully negotiated remote arrangements; you can too.*
