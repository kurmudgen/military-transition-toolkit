**ASE Certifications (Automotive):** $48 per test (funded). Alternative path. Auto/truck mechanic if leaving aviation.

### Military Credit Toward A&P

Air Force aircraft maintenance experience counts toward FAA A&P requirements. With proper documentation, can reduce school time. Many community colleges offer accelerated A&P programs for veterans (12-18 months vs 24 months).

**Best A&P Schools for Veterans:**
- Community colleges near military bases (often have veteran-focused programs)
- Spartan College of Aeronautics (uses GI Bill)
- Aviation Institute of Maintenance (AIM)
- Redstone College

### Industry Certifications

**FAA Inspection Authorization (IA):** Requires A&P + 3 years experience. Allows you to approve major repairs. Significant salary premium.

**Composite Repair:** Specialized certification for modern aircraft. Growing demand.

## 90-Day Action Plan

**Days 1-30:**
Week 1: Research A&P schools, determine if military experience qualifies for credit
Week 2: Apply to A&P program using GI Bill, target start within 6 months
Week 3: Apply to entry-level aviation maintenance positions (don't need A&P yet)
Week 4: Connect with former 2As at airlines/MROs on LinkedIn

**Days 31-60:**
Week 5: If hired pre-A&P, start work while attending A&P school evenings/weekends
Week 6: Network with A&P mechanics, learn about job market
Week 7: Study FAA regulations, airworthiness standards
Week 8: Apply to more positions, especially MROs (often hire non-A&P)

**Days 61-90:**
Week 9: Continue A&P school or start soon after separation
Week 10: Interview prep focusing on safety, attention to detail
Week 11: Final out-processing
Week 12: Start aviation job or full-time A&P school

## Common Mistakes

**1. Not Getting A&P License:** Without A&P, career ceiling is $50K-$60K. With A&P: $75K-$100K+. Use GI Bill for A&P school. Essential investment.

**2. Thinking Military Experience = Civilian Qualification:** FAA requires A&P license to sign off work. Military experience helps but isn't substitute. Get licensed.

**3. Only Applying to Airlines:** MROs, corporate aviation, defense contractors also need mechanics. Don't limit options. MROs often easier entry.

**4. Poor Physical Condition:** Aviation maintenance is physical - climbing, lifting, awkward positions. Stay in shape. Consider this in career planning.

**5. Not Emphasizing Safety Record:** Aviation is safety-obsessed. Highlight zero-accident record, FOD prevention, safety awards. Critical differentiator.
