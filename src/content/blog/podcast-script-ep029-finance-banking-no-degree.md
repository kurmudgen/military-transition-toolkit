[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** No finance degree but good with numbers and people? Finance wants veterans. Financial advisors at ninety thousand, financial analysts at seventy thousand, credit analysts at sixty thousand. Your leadership and integrity transfer - degree optional for many paths.

**Why Finance Wants Veterans:**

Finance industry values trust, integrity, discipline, ability to follow regulations. You have that. Military training emphasized financial responsibility, understanding complex systems, following procedures. Plus - your military network needs financial services. Veterans trust other veterans for financial advice. Companies recognize this.

**High-Pay Entry Paths (No Finance Degree Required):**

**Financial Advisor:** Help clients with investments, retirement planning, insurance, estate planning. $90,640 median. Entry programs start $55K-$60K base plus commissions. Major firms hiring veterans: UBS Financial Advisor Development Program, Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor Associate for Veterans, First Command (veteran-focused). No degree required to start, though firms prefer bachelor's in anything.

Your edge: relationship building, understanding military benefits (TSP, VA disability, survivor benefits, GI Bill), network of service members who need financial guidance. Veterans trust veteran advisors. That's your competitive advantage.

Required certifications: Series 65 (investment advisor representative). NO firm sponsorship required - you can study and take exam independently. $175 exam fee. Self-study 80-120 hours. Pass rate 70-75%. Once licensed, firms will hire you or you can join independent RIA firm.

Advanced: CFP (Certified Financial Planner) increases credibility and pay. Requires bachelor's degree, coursework, and 6,000 hours experience. But start with Series 65, get hired, pursue CFP while working.

**Financial Analyst:** Analyze investments, company performance, market trends. Entry $62K-$91K (varies by location and company). Your analytical skills, attention to detail, understanding risk assessment transfer. Larger companies Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, regional banks all hire.

Entry level accepts non-finance degrees. Your military analysis experience - intelligence, operations analysis, logistics planning - directly applies. Financial modeling learned on job or through short courses (Excel proficiency helps).

**Credit Analyst:** Evaluate loan applications, assess creditworthiness, analyze financial statements. Entry $40K-$60K, average $60K-$77K. Commercial banks, credit unions, commercial lending firms hire. Your risk assessment ability, following guidelines, making sound decisions under pressure transfers perfectly.

Entry requires attention to detail and analytical thinking - you have both. Companies train on their credit policies and financial analysis methods. Many credit analysts have non-finance backgrounds.

**Bank Operations Analyst:** Manage banking systems, process transactions, ensure compliance, coordinate operations. Entry $50K-$53K. Your logistics and operations experience from military applies directly. Banks need people who understand complex procedures, coordinate across departments, maintain accuracy. That's your entire military career.

Operations solid entry point - learn banking from inside, move into lending, financial analysis, or management. Banks promote from within.

**Wealth Management Operations:** Support financial advisors with client operations, account management, trading execution. $50K-$70K. Get exposure to wealth management, learn investment products, build relationships with advisors. Natural pathway to becoming advisor yourself. UBS, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch all hire operations staff.

**Veterans Programs in Finance:**

**Military Financial Advisors Association (MFAA):** Professional network of financial advisors serving military families. Founded by retired Navy CFP. Helps veterans transition into financial planning careers. Resources, mentorship, job connections.

**American College of Financial Services:** Penn Mutual Center for Veterans Affairs awarded 500+ scholarships to veterans and military spouses for financial services education and CFP coursework.

**Major Firm Veteran Programs:**
- Morgan Stanley: Wealth Management Financial Advisor Associate program specifically for veterans
- UBS: Financial Advisor Development Program, operations roles, investment bank operations
- First Command: Financial services firm founded to serve military, actively recruits veteran advisors
- Bank of America: Military hiring initiative, operations and analyst roles
- USAA: Obviously - entire business serving military families

**Certifications Strategy:**

**Series 65 (Start Here):** Investment Advisor Representative license. $175 exam, self-study online (Kaplan, Achievable, Pass Perfect). No sponsorship required. Study 80-120 hours. Once licensed, firms will hire you or join independent RIA.

**Series 7:** Securities Representative license. Allows selling stocks, bonds, mutual funds. Requires firm sponsorship (can't take independently). If firm sponsors you, they'll pay for training. More comprehensive than Series 65.

**Series 63/66:** State securities laws. Often required in addition to Series 7 or instead of Series 65. Firms specify what they need.

**CFP (Long-term):** Certified Financial Planner - gold standard. Requires bachelor's degree, specific coursework, comprehensive exam, 6,000 hours experience. Pursue after working 2-3 years. Significantly increases earning potential ($20K-$40K more).

**The Series 65 Path (Independent Route):**

Study for Series 65 while still active duty. Take exam ($175). Pass. Now you're licensed Investment Advisor Representative. Two options:

Option 1: Apply to major firms (Schwab, Fidelity, Edward Jones, Raymond James) as licensed advisor. They'll hire you into training program with salary.

Option 2: Join independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firm as associate advisor. Learn business, build book of clients from your military network, eventually become lead advisor or start own RIA.

This path gives you control - you're licensed before job hunting. Demonstrates initiative. Firms value candidates who get Series 65 independently.

**Reality Check:**

Financial services is sales. Even "financial analyst" roles often have relationship-building components. If you hate sales or talking to people, maybe not best fit. But if you enjoy helping people solve problems, explaining complex topics, building long-term relationships - financial services solid career.

Advisor path has most earning potential but takes time to build client base. First 2-3 years challenging - building business while learning. But year 5+ very lucrative if you're good. Median $90K hides wide range - top advisors make $150K-$300K+.

Analysis and operations roles more structured - regular salary, defined responsibilities, normal hours. Less earning potential than advisor path but more predictable income and work-life balance.

**Starting Strategy:**

**Option 1 - Financial Advisor (highest pay, entrepreneurial):** Study for Series 65 while active duty (6-12 weeks part-time). Take exam. Apply to veteran programs at major firms (UBS, Morgan Stanley, First Command). Start development program with base salary. Build client base, especially within military community. Timeline: 6-12 months to licensed and hired.

**Option 2 - Financial Analyst (analytical, corporate):** Highlight analytical work from military (intelligence analysis, logistics planning, budgeting). Apply to entry financial analyst roles at banks and corporations. Excel skills important - take online course if needed. Timeline: 3-6 months.

**Option 3 - Operations Entry (stable, internal advancement):** Apply to bank operations or wealth management operations roles. Learn banking/investment operations. Pursue Series licenses while working. Move into client-facing roles or management. Timeline: immediate entry.

**Geographic Considerations:**

Financial services jobs everywhere - every city has banks, credit unions, investment firms. But major financial hubs (New York, Charlotte, Chicago, San Francisco) have most opportunities and highest pay. Regional banks everywhere though - you don't need to move to NYC unless you want investment banking specifically.
