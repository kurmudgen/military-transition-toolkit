## Social Proof Section

**— PO1 Richards, USN, 14 years**

## FAQ Section

### Question 1: How much time will this actually save me?
Most users report saving 40+ hours over their transition. Instead of clicking through VA.gov, state websites, career sites, and benefit portals separately, you get everything in one dashboard. What used to take 3 hours of research now takes 10 minutes.

### Question 2: How do you calculate the $15K in benefits?
We've documented state benefits for all 50 states. The average includes property tax exemptions ($2K-$5K/year), education benefits ($3K-$10K), employment preference (worth $5K+ in faster hiring), and smaller perks (hunting/fishing licenses, vehicle registration discounts, etc.). Most service members don't even know these exist.

### Question 3: What if I don't find $15K in benefits?
Honestly? That's unlikely unless you're moving to a state with minimal veteran benefits. But even if you only find $5K—that's still 20x the cost of the lifetime membership. Plus you're still saving 40+ hours, which is worth $800+ of your time.

### Question 4: Is the lifetime membership really $249?
During the government shutdown, it's completely free (no credit card needed). When .mil verification comes back online, lifetime will be $249, annual $49, or monthly $7. Early users get grandfathered into founder pricing.

### Question 5: What if I've already done most of my research?
You've probably still missed benefits. 90% of users discover something new even after "finishing" their research. Plus, having everything organized in one place is worth it alone—no more hunting through old bookmarks or browser history.

### Question 6: Can I share this with my spouse?
Yes. One account, your whole family can use it. Spouses get access to all the same resources, calculators, and guides. Transition is a family event—we built it that way.

### Question 7: Do you guarantee these results?
We guarantee you'll find benefits you didn't know about or we'll refund you—period. 7-day free trial means you can verify the value yourself before paying a dime.

## Design Notes

### Layout Recommendations
- **Hero:** Vibrant, energetic design. Use green (#10B981) as primary color to signify growth/money/success. Large numbers for stats (40+ hours, $15K).
- **Before/After:** Side-by-side comparison table with red X's and green checks. High contrast.
- **Benefits:** Card-based layout with large numbers. Each benefit gets: icon, title, "what you get," "what it gets you," "time saved."
- **Social Proof:** Highlight the specific result in each testimonial (bold the dollar amount or time saved).
- **FAQ:** Standard accordion. Keep answers short and punchy.
- **Final CTA:** Emphasize the "$0 to start" and money-back guarantee. Green button.

### Color Psychology
- **Primary:** Green (#10B981) = money, growth, success, go
- **Secondary:** Gold/yellow (#F59E0B) = value, premium
- **Accent:** Blue (#3B82F6) = trust, stability
- **Background:** White/light gray for clean, professional look
- **Text:** Dark gray (#1F2937) for readability

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Numbers in hero (40+, $15K+) = largest, bold
2. Headline = large, bold
3. Benefit numbers = medium-large, bold
4. CTA buttons = large, high contrast
5. Body text = readable (16-18px)

### CTA Button Colors/Placement
- **Hero CTA:** Green (#10B981), 60px height, "Save 40+ Hours - Start Free Trial"
- **Mid-page CTAs:** Green buttons after benefit sections
- **Final CTA:** Large green button (70px height) with gold border for premium feel
- Always pair with: "No credit card required" in smaller text

### Image Suggestions
- **Hero:** Calculator/money visual, happy veteran with family (time saved = family time)
- **Before/After:** Split-screen design—left side messy browser tabs, right side clean MTT dashboard
- **Benefits:** Screenshot of each major tool (state benefits calculator, MOS translator, etc.)
- **Social Proof:** Dollar signs or clock icons next to testimonials to reinforce value
- **Final CTA:** Clean, minimal—let the guarantee text and button take focus

## A/B Test Hypothesis

### What We're Testing
**Primary:** Does leading with quantified benefits ($15K, 40+ hours) convert better than leading with pain points or other messaging angles?

**Secondary:** Does emphasizing ROI (return on investment) drive higher-quality leads who are more likely to convert to paid?

### Expected Winner
**Strong hypothesis:** This will be a top-3 performer. Quantified benefits appeal to logical decision-makers and provide clear justification for purchase. The "$15K for $249" ROI is compelling.

**Risk:** May feel too "salesy" or "too good to be true" if user is skeptical. Could underperform with emotional decision-makers who need trust/story first.

**Prediction:** Will perform best with mid-to-senior enlisted (E5-E9) and officers who think in terms of ROI. May underperform with junior enlisted (E1-E4).

### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Free trial sign-up rate (target: 12%+)
- **Secondary:** Trial-to-paid conversion rate (target: 8%+ — higher quality leads expected)
- **Engagement:** Time on page (target: 3+ minutes)
- **Quality:** Lifetime value per customer (expect higher LTV from this variant)

### Statistical Significance Needed
- Minimum 250 visitors per variant (higher bar due to ROI focus)
- 95% confidence level
- Run for 10-14 days to capture weekend vs weekday differences
- Segment by rank/paygrade if data available (hypothesis: officers convert better here)

## Mobile Optimization Notes

### Critical Elements
1. **Hero Stats:** Stack vertically on mobile. Make numbers huge (48px+). "40+ hours" on one line, "$15K+ benefits" on next.
2. **Before/After Table:** Convert to vertical accordion on mobile. "Before" section expands, "After" section expands.
3. **Benefits:** Stack vertically, one per viewport. Put the "time saved" stat at the top of each card for quick scanning.
4. **CTA Button:** Sticky bottom bar with "Start Free Trial" button always visible.
5. **Testimonials:** Swipeable carousel with result stat ($ or time) highlighted.

### Mobile-Specific Copy Adjustments
- Hero headline: "Save 40+ Hours & Find $15K+ in Benefits"
- Subheadline: Shorten to one sentence: "Most service members miss $15K in state benefits. Get everything organized in one platform."
- CTA text: "Start Free Trial" (move "Save 40+ Hours" to subtext)

### Performance
- Lazy load testimonials below fold
- Preload calculator/benefit tool screenshots (above fold)
- Optimize all images to <150KB for mobile
