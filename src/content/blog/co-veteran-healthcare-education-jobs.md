# Colorado Veterans: Healthcare Facilities, Education Benefits & Job Resources

Colorado serves approximately 332,000 veterans - about 7.2% of the state's adult population. With six active military installations and a thriving defense industry, Colorado offers solid healthcare access, strong education programs, and excellent employment opportunities. However, high altitude and cost of living present unique challenges.

This guide provides actual addresses, phone numbers, and actionable information for Colorado veterans.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Healthcare**: 2 VA medical centers (Aurora, Grand Junction), 1 major clinic (Colorado Springs), 15+ community-based clinics, and 4 state veterans homes

**Education**: CU Boulder Yellow Ribbon (unlimited for dependents), Colorado State Yellow Ribbon, strong GI Bill support across Colorado schools

**Employment**: State hiring preference, major defense contractors (Lockheed Martin 14,000+ employees, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman), and veteran-focused job programs

**Veteran Population Hotspots**: El Paso County (Colorado Springs area - strong military community), Denver metro (largest numbers), Boulder County

**Critical consideration**: Altitude (5,000-7,000+ feet) can affect veterans with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions - discuss with your doctor before relocating.

### Wait Times and Quality Ratings

**Rocky Mountain Regional VA (Aurora)**: State-of-the-art facility opened in 2018. Generally rated above average for most services. Wait times average 15-30 days for primary care appointments depending on urgency.

**Grand Junction VA**: Average ratings. Wait times average 10-25 days for primary care. Telehealth connections to Aurora for specialty care reduce need for travel.

**Colorado Springs clinics**: Three clinics serve high veteran population. Wait times vary but generally 15-30 days for routine appointments.

**Best practice**: Enroll in VA healthcare as soon as you separate from active duty, even if you don't plan to use it immediately. This locks in your eligibility and priority group.

### Altitude Considerations for Veterans

**Critical health concern**: Colorado's altitude ranges from 3,300 feet (eastern plains) to 6,000-7,000+ feet (Denver, Colorado Springs, mountain towns).

**Veterans at risk**:
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Heart failure
- Sleep apnea
- Asthma

**Research finding**: Study of veterans at 2,500m (8,200 feet) showed oxygen levels decreased and pulmonary artery pressure increased 43%. Most tolerated altitude well, but 45% experienced mild acute mountain sickness.

**VA support**: The Rocky Mountain Regional VA has a specialized pulmonary medicine team that treats altitude-related complications.

**Recommendation**: If you have respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, consult your VA provider before moving to Colorado. Consider living at lower elevations (eastern plains, Grand Junction at 4,586 feet) rather than mountain towns.

## Education Benefits for Colorado Veterans

### Colorado GI Dependent Scholarship

**Important**: Colorado does **NOT** currently have a state-funded GI dependent scholarship program like Alabama or Texas. Dependents must rely on federal benefits (Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer, Fry Scholarship, DEA).

Several Colorado schools participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, covering out-of-state tuition for qualifying veterans:

**Eligibility**:
- Using Post-9/11 GI Bill, Montgomery GI Bill, or other VA education benefits

### Medical Cannabis and Colorado Veterans

**Federal VA policy**: VA clinicians cannot prescribe or recommend medical marijuana (federal law). However, veterans can participate in Colorado's medical marijuana program without losing VA benefits.

**What VA providers CAN do**:
- Discuss marijuana use as part of care planning
- Not penalize veterans who use medical marijuana
- Continue prescribing medications (including opioids) to medical marijuana users

**What VA providers CANNOT do**:
- Complete paperwork for state medical marijuana programs
- Recommend medical marijuana
- Prescribe medical marijuana
- Pay for medical marijuana

**Colorado medical marijuana card**:
- Application: $29.50 processing fee + $1 transaction fee
- Veterans can apply with any qualifying condition
- Research shows cannabis may help with PTSD symptoms (2x higher remission rates in Colorado study)
- Cannabis use associated with reduced opioid deaths in Colorado

**Bottom line**: Colorado's marijuana legalization gives veterans legal access to cannabis, but VA cannot formally participate. Discuss with VA provider if using cannabis - they won't penalize you, but need to know for comprehensive care.

### Legal Assistance

Free legal assistance for veterans with discharge upgrades, benefits appeals

## Key Takeaways

1. **Enroll in VA healthcare immediately** - Two medical centers plus 15+ clinics provide good access across Colorado
2. **Altitude matters** - If you have respiratory or cardiovascular issues, consult your doctor before moving to Colorado (5,000-7,000+ feet)
3. **CU Boulder and University of Denver offer unlimited Yellow Ribbon** - Best options for dependents and out-of-state students
4. **Colorado Springs is veteran employment hub** - 250+ defense contractors, 14,000+ Lockheed Martin employees
5. **Medical cannabis is legal in Colorado** - VA won't prescribe but won't penalize use
6. **Connect with County Veteran Service Officer** - Free claims assistance in all 64 counties

Colorado's veteran support infrastructure is strong, particularly in Colorado Springs and Denver metro areas. The state genuinely supports its veteran population with solid healthcare access, excellent education programs (especially for engineering/aerospace), and outstanding defense contractor employment opportunities.

The high cost of living (especially Denver metro housing) and altitude concerns are real challenges, but for veterans who love mountains, outdoor recreation, and four-season climate, Colorado delivers.
