# Military to Oil & Gas: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The oil and gas industry offers veterans excellent compensation with entry-level positions starting at $60,000-$80,000 and experienced professionals earning $100,000-$200,000+. Your military technical skills, safety discipline, and ability to work in demanding conditions translate directly. The industry actively recruits veterans for operational, technical, and supervisory roles. Most veterans can transition within 3-6 months, with specific certifications (TWIC, SafeGulf, drilling certifications) enhancing competitiveness.

## Why Veterans Excel in Oil & Gas

Oil and gas operations share fundamental characteristics with military operations: dangerous environments, complex equipment, 24/7 operations, and remote/austere locations. You've already proven you can perform in these conditions.

Safety discipline from military training is essential. Oil and gas operations involve significant hazards (high pressure, flammable materials, heavy equipment), and your safety focus is a major asset.

Technical troubleshooting skills apply directly to maintaining and operating oil and gas equipment. You've diagnosed problems, maintained complex systems, and kept operations running.

Your ability to work extended rotations in remote locations (offshore platforms, remote drilling sites) comes naturally from military deployment experience.

Leadership and teamwork skills support supervisory roles. You've led small teams, maintained standards, and delivered results—exactly what crew supervisors do.

Security clearances and background investigation experience support positions in pipeline security, LNG facilities, and other critical infrastructure.

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. Not Getting TWIC Card**
TWIC is required for most oil and gas positions. Apply early—it takes 6-8 weeks.

**2. Ignoring Safety Certifications**
SafeGulf, H2S training, and other safety certs are expected. Complete them before applying.

**3. Unrealistic Location Expectations**
Oil and gas jobs are where the oil and gas is—often remote areas. Be prepared to relocate or work rotations.

**4. Not Understanding Work Schedules**
Rotational schedules (14/14, 7/7) differ from traditional employment. Ensure lifestyle compatibility.

**5. Ignoring Commodity Price Cycles**
Oil and gas is cyclical. Industry hiring fluctuates with oil prices. Plan accordingly.

**6. Overlooking Downstream/Refining**
Refinery jobs offer good pay with more traditional schedules. Don't focus only on upstream.

**7. Not Leveraging Technical Training**
Your military technical training is valuable. Document and translate it effectively.
