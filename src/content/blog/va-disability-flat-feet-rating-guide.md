# VA Disability Rating for Flat Feet (Pes Planus): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Flat feet (pes planus) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 5276** with ratings from **0% to 50%**. Most veterans receive **10-30%** depending on severity. Flat feet is one of the few conditions with specific **bilateral ratings** (for both feet). The key is proving the condition was **aggravated by military service** since many people have flat feet before service. Document pain, failed treatments, and functional limitations. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Pes Planus and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Pes planus (flat feet) is a condition where the arches of the feet are flattened, allowing the entire sole to touch the ground when standing.

**Types:**
- **Flexible flat feet**: Arch appears when not bearing weight
- **Rigid flat feet**: No arch visible even when not bearing weight

**Symptoms:**
- Pain in heel or arch area
- Swelling along inside of ankle
- Foot fatigue
- Pain that worsens with activity
- Difficulty with prolonged standing or walking
- Back, hip, or knee pain from compensation

**Military connection:**

Most flat feet cases are pre-existing, so veterans claim **aggravation**:
- Running on hard surfaces collapsed arches further
- Heavy rucking worsened condition
- Inadequate arch support in military footwear
- Years of marching and standing

**Can also be directly caused by:**
- Foot/ankle injuries during service
- Posterior tibial tendon injury

## VA Rating Criteria

Flat feet is rated under **38 CFR § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mild; symptoms relieved by built-up shoe or arch support |
| **10%** | Moderate; weight-bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of tendo achillis, pain on manipulation and use of feet (bilateral or unilateral) |
| **20%** | Severe; objective evidence of marked deformity, pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities (unilateral) |
| **30%** | Severe bilateral; same criteria as 20% but both feet |
| **30%** | Pronounced; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances (unilateral) |
| **50%** | Pronounced bilateral; same criteria as 30% pronounced but both feet |

### Key Rating Factors

- **Weight-bearing line**: Where your weight falls on your foot
- **Tendo achillis**: Achilles tendon position
- **Pain on manipulation**: Pain when foot is examined
- **Swelling on use**: Feet swell with activity
- **Callosities**: Calluses from abnormal pressure
- **Failed orthotics**: Not improved by arch supports/shoes

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence

**If claiming aggravation:**
- Entrance exam showing flat feet (establishes baseline)
- Service treatment records showing worsening
- Treatment records during service
- Documentation that military activities worsened condition

**If claiming direct:**
- Evidence feet were normal at entry
- In-service injury causing flat feet
- Diagnosis during service

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Podiatrist or orthopedist evaluation
- X-rays showing arch collapse, bone alignment
- Gait analysis results

### Severity Evidence
- Failed treatments (orthotics, physical therapy)
- Prescription orthotics records
- Documentation of ongoing symptoms

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Check weight-bearing line
2. Assess Achilles tendon position
3. Manipulate feet to check for pain
4. Look for swelling, callosities
5. Review use of orthotics

**What to tell them:**
- Pain with standing and walking
- Swelling after activity
- All treatments tried and their effectiveness
- Functional limitations

## Secondary Conditions

**Flat feet can cause:**
- Plantar fasciitis
- Knee conditions (misalignment)
- Hip conditions
- Back pain
- Ankle problems

**Document these secondary conditions separately.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim flat feet if I had them before service?
Yes. You can claim aggravation—that military service made your flat feet worse beyond natural progression. Document your pre-service baseline and show worsening.

### What if orthotics help my flat feet?
If orthotics completely relieve symptoms, you may only get 0%. If orthotics help but don't eliminate symptoms, you can still get a compensable rating.

### Can I claim knee or back problems secondary to flat feet?
Yes. Flat feet cause abnormal biomechanics that affect knees, hips, and back. Document these as secondary conditions.
