## 1. HOW MILITARY RETIREMENT PAY IS TAXED

### **FEDERAL TAXES**

**Military retirement pay IS subject to federal income tax.**

There is NO federal exemption for military retirement pay. Whether you're E-7 or O-6, your military pension is taxed as ordinary income by the IRS.

**How it works:**
- Military retirement pay = ordinary income (like wages)
- Taxed at your marginal tax rate (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, or 37% depending on total income)
- You receive a 1099-R from DFAS (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) each January
- You report it on Line 5a of Form 1040

**Example:**
- E-7 retiree with 20 years
- Annual military pension: $30,000
- Other income (civilian job): $50,000
- Total income: $80,000
- Federal tax bracket: 22%
- Federal tax on pension: ~$4,500-$5,000

**Note:** You CAN have federal taxes withheld from your military retirement check (recommended). Log into myPay to set withholding.

---

### **STATE TAXES**

**State taxation of military retirement pay varies DRAMATICALLY.**

- **9 states:** No income tax at all (military retirement + wages + everything is tax-free)
- **14 states:** Don't tax military retirement pay specifically (but tax other income)
- **11 states:** Partial exemptions (exempt $X amount, or age-based exemptions)
- **16 states:** FULL taxation (military retirement taxed just like wages)

**The Difference:**
- **Texas (no income tax):** $0 state tax on $50K pension
- **California (full taxation):** ~$1,500-$2,500 state tax on $50K pension
- **Lifetime difference:** $45,000-$75,000 over 30 years

**Bottom Line:** Where you retire can save you $50,000-$150,000+ in state taxes over your lifetime.

## 2. THE 9 STATES WITH NO INCOME TAX

These states don't tax ANY income—military retirement, wages, investment income, nothing.

### **THE 9 ZERO-TAX STATES**

1. **Alaska**
2. **Florida**
3. **Nevada**
4. **New Hampshire** (taxes dividends/interest only, phasing out by 2027)
5. **South Dakota**
6. **Tennessee** (eliminated Hall Tax in 2021—now zero income tax)
7. **Texas**
8. **Washington** (capital gains tax on high earners $250K+, but no general income tax)
9. **Wyoming**

---

### **WHY THESE STATES ARE BEST FOR RETIREES**

**Annual Savings Example ($50,000 pension):**

Compare Texas (no tax) to California (full tax):
- Texas: $0 state tax
- California: ~$1,500-$2,500 state tax (depending on other income)
- **Annual savings: $1,500-$2,500**
- **30-year savings: $45,000-$75,000**

**For higher pensions:**

Compare Florida (no tax) to New York (partial exemption):
- E-9 retiree, $60,000 pension
- Florida: $0
- New York: ~$1,200-$1,800 (after $30K exemption)
- **Annual savings: $1,200-$1,800**
- **30-year savings: $36,000-$54,000**

---

### **TRADE-OFFS OF ZERO-TAX STATES**

**Pros:**
✓ Zero state income tax
✓ Saves thousands per year
✓ Keeps more of your pension

**Cons:**
⚠ Some have higher property taxes (Texas, New Hampshire)
⚠ Some have higher sales taxes (Tennessee 9.5%, Washington 8.9%)
⚠ May have fewer state services (education, infrastructure)

**Best Zero-Tax States for Retirees:**
1. **Florida** - No income tax, warm weather, large veteran population, no estate tax
2. **Texas** - No income tax, strong veteran benefits (Hazlewood, property tax exemption)
3. **Tennessee** - No income tax, lower cost of living, veteran-friendly
4. **Nevada** - No income tax, no estate tax, 100% disabled get property tax exemption
5. **Wyoming** - No income tax, low population, scenic

## 7. VA DISABILITY PAY TAX TREATMENT

**VA disability compensation is 100% TAX-FREE (federal and state).**

This is true in ALL 50 states. No state taxes VA disability pay.

**Example:**
- 100% VA disability: $3,737/month = $44,844/year
- Federal tax: $0
- State tax (all states): $0
- **Completely tax-free**

**Important:**
- VA disability is reported on IRS Form 1040 but NOT as taxable income
- You do not pay FICA (Social Security/Medicare) taxes on VA disability
- VA disability does NOT count toward your income for purposes of tax brackets

---

### **VA DISABILITY + MILITARY RETIREMENT**

If you're medically retired or receive both VA disability and military retirement:

**Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay (CRDP):**
- If you're 50%+ VA disabled AND have 20+ years of service
- You receive BOTH full military retirement AND full VA disability
- Military retirement: Taxable (state depends on state laws)
- VA disability: Tax-free

**Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC):**
- For combat-related injuries
- Allows you to receive VA disability + portion of military retirement
- CRSC is tax-free

**Example:**
- Retiree in Texas (no income tax)
- Military retirement: $40,000/year (federal taxable, state tax-free in TX)
- VA disability: $30,000/year (100% tax-free)
- Total income: $70,000
- Taxable income: $40,000 (just the retirement)
- Tax-free: $30,000 (VA disability)

---

## 8. CONCURRENT RETIREMENT & DISABILITY PAY (CRDP/CRSC)

**If you're receiving both military retirement and VA disability, understand the tax implications.**

### **CRDP (Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay)**

**Eligibility:**
- 20+ years of service
- 50%+ VA disability rating
- Retired from active duty (not medical retirement under 20 years)

**How it works:**
- You receive FULL military retirement (taxable)
- You receive FULL VA disability (tax-free)
- Before CRDP, your military retirement was reduced dollar-for-dollar by your VA disability

**Tax Treatment:**
- Military retirement: Taxable (federal + state depending on state law)
- VA disability: Tax-free

---

### **CRSC (Combat-Related Special Compensation)**

**Eligibility:**
- Combat-related injury/disability
- Can apply even if under 20 years service (if medically retired)

**How it works:**
- You receive a portion of your military retirement tax-free (the combat-related portion)

**Tax Treatment:**
- Non-combat portion of retirement: Taxable
- Combat-related portion (CRSC): Tax-free

**You cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC. You must choose whichever gives you more money.**

---

## 9. TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES

### **STRATEGY 1: RELOCATE TO A TAX-FRIENDLY STATE**

**The single biggest tax savings for military retirees.**

**Before You Move:**
1. Calculate your current state tax on military retirement
2. Calculate tax in target state
3. Compare cost of living (lower taxes may be offset by higher housing costs)
4. Consider other factors (family, job prospects, climate, VA healthcare)

**Best States to Relocate:**
- Florida (no tax, warm, large veteran community)
- Texas (no tax, Hazlewood Act, veteran benefits)
- Tennessee (no tax, lower cost of living)
- Pennsylvania (100% military retirement exempt, reasonable cost of living)

---

### **STRATEGY 2: OPTIMIZE FEDERAL TAX WITHHOLDING**

**Make sure you're withholding enough (or not too much) from your military retirement check.**

**How to adjust:**
1. Log into myPay (mypay.dfas.mil)
2. Navigate to "Federal Tax Withholding"
3. Choose withholding percentage or dollar amount
4. Recommended: Withhold 10-15% if you have other income

**Why this matters:**
- Under-withholding = tax bill + potential penalty in April
- Over-withholding = giving IRS an interest-free loan

**Check annually:** Review your tax situation each year and adjust withholding.

---

### **STRATEGY 3: TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STATE RESIDENCY RULES**

**You can choose your state of residency if you're still active duty.**

**Military Spouse Residency Relief Act:**
- Active duty members can claim any state as residence for tax purposes
- Most choose state with lowest taxes (even if stationed elsewhere)

**Example:**
- Active duty member stationed in California (high taxes)
- Claim Texas as state of residence (no income tax)
- File taxes in Texas, not California
- **Save thousands per year**

**After retirement:**
- You establish new residency based on where you physically live
- If you move to Texas and establish residency, you can claim Texas as home state

---

### **STRATEGY 4: CONSIDER VA DISABILITY RATING BEFORE RETIRING**

**VA disability is tax-free. Military retirement is taxable.**

**If you're eligible for VA disability, file BEFORE you retire:**
- VA disability is tax-free (federal + state)
- Military retirement is taxable
- The higher your VA rating, the more of your income is tax-free

**Example:**
- E-8 with 20 years retiring
- Military retirement: $40,000/year (taxable)
- If you get 50% VA disability: $1,110/month ($13,320/year tax-free)
- If you get 70% VA disability: $1,800/month ($21,600/year tax-free)
- If you get 100% VA disability: $3,737/month ($44,844/year tax-free)

**With CRDP (if 50%+):**
- You get BOTH full retirement AND VA disability
- Higher VA rating = more tax-free income

---

### **STRATEGY 5: USE STANDARD DEDUCTION + ITEMIZE SMART**

**Federal Tax:**

**Standard Deduction (2024):**
- Single: $14,600
- Married filing jointly: $29,200

**Most retirees take standard deduction.**

**When to itemize:**
- If your mortgage interest + state taxes + charitable donations > standard deduction
- For many retirees in low-tax states, standard deduction is better

---

### **STRATEGY 6: MAXIMIZE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT CONTRIBUTIONS**

**Reduce taxable income by contributing to:**

**TSP (if you're federal employee post-military):**
- Contribute up to $23,000/year (2024)
- Reduces taxable income
- Grows tax-deferred

**Traditional IRA:**
- Contribute up to $7,000/year (2024), $8,000 if 50+
- Tax-deductible (if income limits met)
- Reduces taxable income

**Example:**
- Military retirement: $50,000
- Contribute $7,000 to Traditional IRA
- Taxable income: $43,000 (instead of $50,000)
- Tax savings: $1,540 (at 22% bracket)

---

### **STRATEGY 7: TIME YOUR RETIREMENT DATE**

**Your retirement date can affect your first-year taxes.**

**Example:**
- Retire January 1: Full year of retirement pay (taxable)
- Retire December 31: Only 1 day of retirement pay in that tax year

**Strategy:**
- If you're retiring mid-year and moving to a tax-friendly state, consider timing your move and retirement date to minimize taxes in high-tax state

---

## 10. RELOCATION DECISION CALCULATOR

**Should you relocate to save on taxes?**

**STEP 1: Calculate Current Annual State Tax**

Current state tax on military retirement: $_________

**STEP 2: Calculate Tax in Target State**

Tax in target state (use Section 6): $_________

**STEP 3: Annual Savings**

Current tax - Target tax = Annual savings: $_________

**STEP 4: Lifetime Savings (30 years)**

Annual savings × 30 = Lifetime savings: $_________

---

**STEP 5: Consider Other Factors**

□ Cost of living difference (housing, property taxes, sales tax)
□ Family ties (grandkids, parents)
□ Job prospects (if working post-retirement)
□ Healthcare (VA facilities in area?)
□ Climate preference
□ Veteran community

**STEP 6: Decision**

If lifetime savings > $25,000 AND other factors favorable → **Consider relocating**

If lifetime savings < $10,000 → **Probably not worth moving**

---

## 11. STATE TAX COMPARISON TOOL

**Use this to compare your current state to potential relocation states.**

**Your Info:**
- Annual military retirement pay: $_________
- Other income (civilian job, etc.): $_________
- Current state: _________

**Tax Calculation:**

**Current State:**
- State tax on military retirement: $_________
- State tax on other income: $_________
- Total state tax: $_________

**Target State #1: _________**

---

## 12. ACTION PLAN: MINIMIZING YOUR TAX BURDEN

### **6-12 MONTHS BEFORE RETIREMENT**

□ Calculate your estimated military retirement pay (use Defense Finance calculator)
□ Research state tax treatment of military retirement
□ Calculate potential tax savings by relocating
□ Decide if you're moving to a tax-friendly state
□ File for VA disability if you haven't already

---

### **3-6 MONTHS BEFORE RETIREMENT**

   - Update driver's license
   - Register to vote
   - Register vehicles

□ Set up federal tax withholding on military retirement (myPay)
□ Open Traditional IRA or ensure TSP is set up (if working post-retirement)
□ Consult with tax professional familiar with military retirement

---

### **AFTER RETIREMENT**

□ File taxes in your new state of residence
□ Claim military retirement exemption (if available in your state)
□ Review and adjust tax withholding annually
□ Keep records of your state residency (driver's license, voter registration, etc.)
□ File for CRDP if eligible (50%+ VA rating + 20 years)

---

### **ANNUALLY**

□ Review state tax laws (they change!)
□ Adjust federal withholding if income changes
□ Maximize retirement account contributions
□ Consider tax-loss harvesting in investment accounts
