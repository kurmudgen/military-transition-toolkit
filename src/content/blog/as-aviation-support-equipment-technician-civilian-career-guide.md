## Bottom Line Up Front

Navy AS technicians keep the ground support equipment (GSE) running—the diesel generators, hydraulic test stands, nitrogen carts, air conditioners, tow tractors, and everything else that makes naval aviation happen. That's **diesel/gas engine expertise, hydraulic and pneumatic systems knowledge, and heavy equipment maintenance that translates directly to high-demand civilian trades**. You've got hands-on experience with engines, electrical systems, welding, fabrication, refrigeration, and fleet management. Realistic first-year civilian salaries range from **$45,000-$61,000**, with experienced diesel and heavy equipment mechanics hitting **$70,000-$85,000**. Specialized roles (GSE technician at airlines, industrial maintenance supervisor) reach **$85,000-$95,000+**. Your biggest advantage? You're a generalist with broad mechanical skills. That flexibility opens more doors than narrow specialization.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every AS looking at civilian jobs faces the same confusion: "I worked on ground equipment. What's the civilian equivalent?"

You tell someone you maintained aviation support equipment and they have no clue what you're talking about.

Here's what civilians miss: **you're a diesel mechanic, hydraulic technician, heavy equipment mechanic, welder, and electrician rolled into one.**

You didn't just "fix yellow gear." You:
- Diagnosed and repaired diesel and gasoline engines on mobile equipment
- Troubleshot hydraulic and pneumatic systems (pumps, cylinders, valves, accumulators)
- Performed electrical diagnostics and repairs on 12V/24V systems
- Welded, fabricated, and performed bodywork on damaged equipment
- Maintained air conditioning and refrigeration systems (cryogenic oxygen/nitrogen equipment)
- Operated and maintained forklifts, tractors, generators, compressors, test stands
- Managed fleet maintenance schedules and parts inventories
- Followed technical manuals and safety procedures
- Trained junior technicians on equipment operation

That's skilled trades work. Diesel mechanics, heavy equipment mechanics, GSE technicians, industrial maintenance techs, HVAC techs, and fleet managers do exactly what you did. The civilian world needs these skills desperately—there's a nationwide shortage of qualified technicians.

You're not "just military." You're a journeyman-level tradesman with certifications waiting to be formalized.

## Best civilian career paths for Navy AS

Let's get specific. Here's where AS technicians consistently land jobs, with real salary data.

### Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Mechanic - Airlines & Airports (direct translation, good pay)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Aviation Ground Support Equipment Mechanic
- GSE Technician

- **ASE certifications** (helpful but not required)—$47/test

**Reality check:**
Airlines (United, Delta, American, Southwest), regional carriers, cargo operations (FedEx, UPS), and airport authorities all hire GSE mechanics. Demand is high because equipment breaks constantly and flights can't leave without working ground support equipment.

Pay varies by location. Major hubs (LAX, ORD, ATL, JFK) pay more. Smaller airports pay less. Work involves shift work (nights, weekends, holidays) because airlines operate 24/7.

Job security is excellent. Airlines need GSE mechanics year-round. Recession-resistant because air travel is essential.

Downside: You're still working outside in all weather, turning wrenches, dealing with emergency breakdowns. But you're going home every night, and airline benefits (free flights, retirement matching) are strong.

**Best for:** AS technicians who want to stay in aviation, work with similar equipment, and get better pay with less military BS.

### Diesel Mechanic / Diesel Technician (high demand, solid pay)

**Civilian job titles:**

- **HVAC certification / trade school**—Cost: $2,000-10,000 (GI Bill covers). Time: 6-18 months
- **State HVAC contractor license** (if you want to start your own business eventually)—varies by state
- **NATE certification** (North American Technician Excellence)—industry-recognized credential. Cost: $75-150/test

**Reality check:**
HVAC is a solid trade with consistent demand. Every building needs heating and cooling. Baby boomers are retiring. Demand for techs is high.

Your AS background with aircraft A/C systems gives you a head start. Civilian HVAC is simpler than military cryogenic systems.

Work is split between residential (houses) and commercial (buildings, facilities). Commercial pays more and is less customer drama. Residential involves dealing with homeowners (some are difficult).

Seasonal workload: busy in summer (A/C repairs), busy in winter (furnace repairs). Spring/fall are slower. Overtime is common during peak seasons.

Long-term path: work for a company for 3-5 years, get licensed, start your own HVAC business. HVAC business owners can make $100K+ but you're running a business, not just turning wrenches.

**Best for:** AS technicians who enjoyed working on A/C and refrigeration systems and want a trade with entrepreneurship potential.

### Fleet Maintenance Manager / Supervisor

**Civilian job titles:**

- Training and safety programs

**Certifications needed:**
- **Certified Automotive Fleet Manager (CAFM)**—Cost: $500-1,000. Shows management competency
- **Associate's or Bachelor's degree** (preferred for management roles)—Use GI Bill
- **ASE certifications** (shows you know the technical side)
- **OSHA safety training**

**Reality check:**
This is the management track. You're not turning wrenches all day—you're managing the people who do.

Companies with large fleets hire fleet managers: city/county governments (police, fire, public works), delivery companies (FedEx, UPS, Amazon), utility companies, construction firms, rental companies.

Your AS background—where you managed equipment maintenance, tracked NALCOMIS data, ordered parts, and trained junior techs—is exactly what fleet management requires.

Pay is higher than technician roles but requires supervisory experience and often a degree. If you made E-6 or above and supervised people, you're qualified for entry-level fleet supervisor roles.

Less physical work, more office time, more personnel management (scheduling, discipline, training). If you liked the leadership side of being a senior AS, this path makes sense.

**Best for:** AS technicians who made E-5/E-6 or above, supervised people, and want to move into management.

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - For moving into operations management. Cost: $500-3,000. Value: Advanced career step, not entry-level need.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be real. Here's what you'll need to adjust:

**Broader systems knowledge:** Navy AS is a generalist rating, which is good. But civilian employers often want specialists (diesel mechanic OR HVAC tech OR hydraulic specialist). You might need to choose a lane and get certified in that specific area.

**Customer service skills:** Military maintenance is "fix it and move on." Civilian side (especially HVAC, mobile diesel tech, dealership work) involves talking to customers, explaining problems, providing estimates. You need people skills, not just wrench skills.

**Computer diagnostic tools:** Modern diesel engines and heavy equipment use computerized diagnostics. If your computer experience is limited to NALCOMIS and basic MS Office, you'll need to learn diagnostic software. Most employers provide training, but being comfortable with computers helps.

**Entrepreneurship mindset (if going HVAC or welding):** Skilled trades offer opportunity to start your own business. That requires business skills—marketing, estimating, invoicing, taxes, insurance. If you want to be your own boss eventually, you'll need to learn the business side.

**Civilian pace vs. military pace:** Civilian shops aren't scrambling to get aircraft ready for flight ops. The urgency is different. Some AS guys find civilian maintenance work "too slow." Adjust expectations.

## Real AS success stories

**Carlos, 27, former AS (E-5) → GSE Mechanic at United Airlines (SFO)**

After 6 years maintaining yellow gear at NAS North Island, Carlos got out and applied to airline GSE mechanic positions. Started at United in San Francisco at $58,000. Now makes $72,000 after 3 years with full airline benefits (free flights, retirement match). Same work he did in the Navy—diesel equipment, hydraulics, emergency repairs—but better pay and he's home every night. Shift work but consistent schedule.

**Amber, 29, former AS → Diesel Mechanic at Caterpillar Dealer**

Amber did 5 years as an AS, got out and used her GI Bill to get ASE diesel certifications. Got hired by a Caterpillar dealership in Texas as a heavy equipment diesel mechanic. Started at $52,000, now makes $68,000 after 4 years with manufacturer training (company-paid). Works on construction equipment (excavators, loaders, dozers). Likes the variety and the fact that Caterpillar pays for advanced training.

**Mike, 32, former AS (E-6) → Fleet Maintenance Supervisor for city government**

Mike did 8 years, made E-6, supervised junior AS techs. Got out and leveraged his leadership experience to land a fleet supervisor position for a city public works department. Manages maintenance for 80+ vehicles (trucks, buses, heavy equipment). Started at $68,000, now makes $79,000 after 3 years with full government pension and benefits. Less wrenching, more paperwork and people management, but he enjoys the leadership role.

## Action plan: your first 90 days out

Here's what to actually do when you transition:

### Month 1: Assessment and documentation
- Get your DD-214, keep 10 copies, upload digital version
- Request training jackets (proof of AS school, any additional certifications)
- Document every piece of equipment you were qualified to operate/repair
- Apply for VA benefits if eligible
- Set up LinkedIn profile highlighting diesel, hydraulics, electrical experience
- Research career paths: stay in aviation (GSE) OR pivot to diesel/heavy equipment OR HVAC
- Identify target employers in your area (airlines, construction companies, rental companies, city/county government)

### Month 2: Quick certifications and applications
- Get forklift certification (1 day, cheap, required for many jobs)
- Get OSHA 10-hour safety cert (1 week online)
- Get EPA 608 cert if considering HVAC (1 day)
- Update resume using skills translation table above
- Apply to 10-15 jobs per week (Indeed, company websites, government job boards)
- Network with other AS veterans who transitioned (LinkedIn)
- Attend veteran job fairs (especially if airlines or major employers are attending)

### Month 3: Certifications and interviews
- Start ASE diesel certifications OR enroll in HVAC program OR heavy equipment program (pick one, use GI Bill)
- Tailor resume for each application (emphasize diesel for diesel jobs, hydraulics for industrial jobs, etc.)
- Practice interview answers: technical questions about engines, hydraulics, troubleshooting
- Follow up on applications (phone calls, walk-ins for local companies)
- Consider temporary work if direct hire hasn't happened (temp agencies, contract work)
- Join trade associations (ASE, HVAC, etc.) for networking

## Bottom line for Navy AS

Your AS experience is broad, technical, and in high demand.

You've proven you can diagnose and repair complex mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, and refrigeration systems. You can weld, fabricate, operate heavy equipment, and manage fleet maintenance. Those are skilled trades that can't be outsourced.

First-year civilian income of $45K-61K is realistic for entry-level skilled trades. With certifications (ASE diesel, HVAC license) and 3-5 years experience, $65K-85K is achievable. Management roles (fleet supervisor, maintenance manager) hit $75K-110K.

Your three fastest paths:
1. **Apply to airline/airport GSE mechanic jobs** (direct translation, good pay, benefits)
2. **Get ASE diesel certs, work as diesel mechanic** (high demand, solid pay, clear career path)
3. **Get HVAC license, become HVAC tech** (entrepreneurship potential, strong demand)

All three paths work. Pick based on what you enjoyed most: staying in aviation (GSE), working on big engines (diesel/heavy equipment), or pivoting to HVAC.

There's a nationwide shortage of skilled trades workers. Baby boomers are retiring faster than young people are entering the trades. You're trained, experienced, and ready to work. Employers need you more than you need them.

Don't undersell yourself. You're a journeyman-level technician with military discipline and technical training. Act like it.
