# New Jersey Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

New Jersey's best tax benefit for veterans is the 100% exemption of military retirement pay from state income tax—a benefit that saves the average military retiree about $2,000-$3,000 annually. The state also offers a full property tax exemption for 100% permanently and totally disabled veterans with no income cap or dollar limit, potentially saving $8,000-$15,000+ per year depending on county.

If you're a 100% P&T disabled veteran, New Jersey's property tax exemption applies to your entire homestead value with no restrictions. Combined with no state tax on military retirement, a 100% disabled veteran retiree in Bergen County could save over $20,000 annually compared to living in a state that taxes both.

The downside? New Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the nation at 2.23% average, meaning non-disabled veterans and veterans with ratings below 100% pay some of the steepest property taxes in America. A $565,000 home (NJ's 2025 median) generates about $12,600 in annual property taxes. All veterans get a modest $250 annual property tax deduction, but that's barely a dent in NJ's sky-high property tax bills.

Another major limitation: New Jersey doesn't offer partial property tax exemptions for veterans rated 10-90% disabled. You're either 100% P&T disabled (full exemption) or you get just the $250 deduction that all veterans receive. This puts NJ behind states like Oklahoma (100% exemption for 50%+ disabled) or Kansas ($16,744+ exemption for 50%+).

Overall, New Jersey ranks as one of the best states for 100% P&T disabled veterans and military retirees with significant pension income, but expensive for everyone else. If you're planning to retire here, factor in New Jersey's extremely high cost of living—median home prices hit $565,000 in 2025, and rental costs average $2,310/month statewide. The tax savings are substantial if you qualify, but housing costs will still stretch your budget.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Permanently and Totally Disabled Veterans:**
- Exemption amount: 100% of assessed property value
- Cap: None—unlimited exemption
- Requirements: Must have 100% permanent and total (P&T) service-connected disability from the VA
- Annual savings: $8,000-$15,000+ (based on median home values in major NJ counties)

If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, your primary residence is completely exempt from property taxes. There's no income limit, no cap on home value, and no restrictions. Whether your house is worth $300,000 or $1,000,000, you pay zero property tax. In a state with the nation's highest property tax rates, this is an enormous benefit.

Important: You must be 100% **permanently and totally** disabled. A 100% temporary rating does not qualify. The VA designation on your award letter must show "P&T" status. This is stricter than some states (Nebraska, for example, accepts 100% temporary).

After December 3, 2020, wartime service is no longer required—you just need 100% P&T disability from active duty service, regardless of when or where you served.

**Surviving Spouses:**
- Eligible if veteran was 100% P&T disabled at time of death
- Must remain unmarried
- Exemption continues as long as spouse owns and occupies the home
- Can transfer exemption to a new home

**70-90% Disabled:**
- Exemption: None (only $250 annual deduction)
- Savings: $250/year

New Jersey doesn't offer partial property tax exemptions for veterans rated 70-90% disabled. You get the same $250 deduction as all other veterans, which is essentially nothing given NJ's property tax rates.

**50-60% Disabled:**
- Exemption: None (only $250 annual deduction)
- Savings: $250/year

No property tax relief for this rating level either.

**10-40% Disabled:**
- Exemption: None (only $250 annual deduction)
- Savings: $250/year

**Under 10% / General Veterans:**
- Annual deduction: $250
- Savings: $250/year

All honorably discharged veterans who served during wartime qualify for a $250 annual property tax deduction. This applies to your primary residence. While $250 is better than nothing, it's barely noticeable when your property tax bill is $10,000-$15,000.

### How to Apply

**For 100% P&T Disabled Veteran Exemption:**

1. **Contact your municipal tax assessor** (varies by municipality—Bergen County, Hudson County, Middlesex County, etc.)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - VA award letter showing 100% permanent and total service-connected disability
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
   - Proof of New Jersey residency
   - Property deed or mortgage statement showing you own and occupy the dwelling
   - Photo ID
3. **File Form D.V.S.S.E.** (Claim for Property Tax Exemption on Dwelling of Disabled Veteran or Surviving Spouse/Domestic Partner)
4. **Deadline:** You can file at any time during the tax year, but file before the tax bill is issued to receive exemption for that year

**Processing:** Typically 30-60 days. Once approved, the exemption remains in effect as long as you own and occupy the home and maintain your 100% P&T status.

**For $250 Annual Veteran Deduction:**

1. **File Form V.S.S.** with your local assessor or tax collector
2. **Documents needed:**
   - DD Form 214 showing wartime service
   - Proof you're a NJ resident and property owner
3. **Deadline:** Varies by municipality (typically before October 1 for the following tax year)

**Application Support:**
- New Jersey Division of Taxation: (609) 292-7974
- NJ Department of Military & Veterans Affairs: (609) 530-6854

### Property Tax by County

New Jersey has the highest property tax rates in the nation. Here's how major counties compare:

| County | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Annual Savings (100% P&T) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bergen | $575,000 | 2.28% | $13,110 | $13,110 |
| Hudson | $650,000 | 1.91% | $12,415 | $12,415 |
| Essex | $425,000 | 2.05% | $8,713 | $8,713 |
| Middlesex | $450,000 | 2.29% | $10,305 | $10,305 |
| Monmouth | $550,000 | 1.89% | $10,395 | $10,395 |
| Union | $425,000 | 2.35% | $9,988 | $9,988 |
| Passaic | $400,000 | 2.20% | $8,800 | $8,800 |
| Morris | $580,000 | 2.15% | $12,470 | $12,470 |
| Somerset | $525,000 | 2.10% | $11,025 | $11,025 |
| Camden | $225,000 | 2.30% | $5,175 | $5,175 |
| Ocean | $420,000 | 2.05% | $8,610 | $8,610 |
| Atlantic | $310,000 | 1.95% | $6,045 | $6,045 |
| Cumberland | $175,000 | 2.13% | $3,728 | $3,728 |

Bergen and Morris counties have the highest total tax bills due to expensive home values. Hudson County's rate is relatively lower (1.91%) but home values are high, resulting in $12,000+ annual taxes. Even affordable counties like Cumberland and Atlantic generate $3,700-$6,000 annual bills.

A 100% P&T disabled veteran saves the full amount—$13,110 in Bergen County, $12,470 in Morris County, $10,305 in Middlesex County. Over 20 years, that's $200,000-$260,000 in tax savings in expensive counties.

**Payment Deadlines:** Property taxes in New Jersey are paid quarterly (Feb 1, May 1, Aug 1, Nov 1) in most municipalities. If you're exempt, you don't pay—simple as that.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: 100% exempt
- Annual savings: $2,000-$3,500+ (depending on retirement income)

New Jersey fully exempts U.S. military pension and survivor benefit payments from state income tax. This applies to all branches: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force, USPHS Commissioned Corps, and NOAA Corps officers.

**Who qualifies:** Anyone receiving military retirement benefits reported on IRS Form 1099-R issued by the Department of Defense.

**How it works:** When you file your New Jersey tax return (Form NJ-1040), exclude military retirement income from your gross income. Tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block automatically excludes it if you indicate it's military retirement.

**Example calculation:**
- Annual military retirement: $50,000
- New Jersey top tax rate: 10.75% (for income over $1 million)
- Typical rate for retirees: 5.525-6.37%
- Annual savings: $2,763-$3,185

If you're an O-5 retiree with $60,000 annual pension, you save about $3,300-$3,800 per year compared to states that tax military retirement. Over 20 years, that's $66,000-$76,000.

**Important distinction:** Federal civil service retirement (OPM pensions) ARE taxable in New Jersey, even if based on military service credit. Only direct military retirement from DoD is exempt.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt (like all states)
- Tax-free federally and at the state level

All VA disability compensation is tax-free. New Jersey doesn't tax it, and neither does the federal government. This is standard across all states.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Taxation: 100% exempt from New Jersey state income tax
- Details: Survivor Benefit Plan payments to military spouses/dependents are treated the same as military retirement pay

New Jersey exempts SBP payments from state income tax, which is significant for surviving spouses. Many states tax SBP, but New Jersey doesn't.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Subject to New Jersey income tax (not exempt)
- **Combat pay:** Generally exempt from federal tax; New Jersey follows federal treatment
- **Active duty pay:** Taxable by New Jersey if you're a legal resident. If you're stationed at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst or Fort Dix but maintain legal residency in another state, you're not subject to NJ income tax on your military pay under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)

### New Jersey Income Tax Rates

New Jersey has a progressive income tax with rates from 1.4% to 10.75%:

- $0-$20,000: 1.4%
- $20,001-$35,000: 1.75%
- $35,001-$40,000: 3.5%
- $40,001-$75,000: 5.525%
- $75,001-$500,000: 6.37%
- $500,001-$1,000,000: 8.97%
- $1,000,001+: 10.75%

Most military retirees fall in the 5.525-6.37% brackets, meaning the military retirement exemption saves you roughly 5.5-6.4% of your pension annually.

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran License Plates:**
- Cost: Standard registration fees apply (plates themselves may be free, but registration is not)
- Requirements: Must be a disabled veteran
- Annual savings: Varies—disabled veteran plates may qualify for parking meter fee exemptions in some municipalities

New Jersey offers special disabled veteran license plates. The plates themselves may be issued at no cost, but you still pay regular vehicle registration fees.

**Pending Legislation (2024-2025):**
- **A4348/S1908**: Proposes "100 Percent Disabled Veteran" plates at no cost with full handicapped parking privileges
- **S3437**: Proposes "Disabled Veteran" plates for veterans with mobility disabilities with a $15 fee

As of 2025, these bills are pending but not yet law.

**Parking Privileges:**
- Current law (N.J.S.A. 39:4-207.10): Disabled veterans and Purple Heart recipients displaying special plates or placards are exempt from municipal parking meter fees for up to 24 hours
- This applies to meters operated by municipalities—not all parking lots or private facilities

**Registration Fees:**
- No general veteran exemptions
- Standard fees: $35.50-$84 depending on vehicle type and weight
- 100% P&T disabled veterans: FREE vehicle registration per pending legislation (not yet law as of 2025)

**Purple Heart Plates:**
- Available to Purple Heart recipients
- Same parking meter exemption as disabled veteran plates
- Standard registration fees apply

## Sales Tax Exemptions

- Vehicle purchases: No exemption for veterans
- Other items: No general sales tax exemptions
- State sales tax rate: 6.625%

New Jersey doesn't offer sales tax breaks for veterans on vehicle purchases or other goods. You'll pay the standard 6.625% state sales tax. (Note: Certain items like clothing under $110, groceries, and prescription drugs are exempt for everyone, not just veterans.)

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% P&T Disabled Veteran Example (Bergen County):**

Over 20 years, that's $317,460 in tax savings.

**70% Rating (Bergen County):**
- Property tax saved: $250
- Income tax saved (military retirement, $50K): $2,763

- **Total savings: $3,013/year**

**Military retiree with no VA disability:**
- Property tax saved: $250
- Income tax saved: $2,763/year
- **Total savings: $3,013/year**

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% P&T Disabled (Bergen County):**
- Annual savings: $15,873
- 20-year total: $317,460
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $236,800

**70% Rating:**
- Annual savings: $3,013
- 20-year total: $60,260
- Net present value: $44,900

**50% Rating:**
- Annual savings: $3,013
- 20-year total: $60,260
- Net present value: $44,900

**Military Retiree (No VA rating):**
- Annual savings: $3,013
- 20-year total: $60,260
- Net present value: $44,900

The big benefit in New Jersey is for 100% P&T disabled veterans. Everyone else saves a modest $3,000/year from the military retirement exemption plus the token $250 property tax deduction.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Tax Exemption | Annual Savings (100% P&T) |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **New Jersey** | Fully exempt | Full exemption, no cap | $15,873 |
| New York | Fully exempt | Varies by county, $5K-$54K exemptions | $8,000-$12,000 |
| Pennsylvania | Fully exempt | Full exemption, no cap (select counties) | $12,000 |
| Delaware | Age 60+: $12,500 exempt | $0-$12,500 depending on rating | $5,000 |
| Connecticut | Fully exempt | Full exemption (100% P&T) | $14,000 |
| Maryland | First $5,000 exempt | Property tax credit (up to $17K+) | $8,500 |

**Verdict:** New Jersey ranks near the top among Northeastern states for 100% P&T disabled veterans due to unlimited property tax exemption plus full military retirement exemption. Pennsylvania and Connecticut offer similar benefits. New York's property tax exemption varies widely by county—some offer more generous benefits, others less.

For non-disabled military retirees, all these states fully exempt military retirement (or mostly exempt it), so New Jersey is competitive but not exceptional. The key differentiator is property tax—NJ's is the highest in the nation, so retirees without exemptions feel the pain.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Property tax exemption:** Top tier nationally—New Jersey's no-cap policy for 100% P&T disabled is among the best
- **Income tax treatment:** Excellent—full exemption for military retirement puts New Jersey in the top 25 states
- **Overall ranking:** Top 10 nationally for 100% P&T disabled veterans; middle of the pack for veterans with lower ratings

According to studies by Veterans United and VA Claims Insider, New Jersey ranks in the top 10-12 states for veteran tax benefits when you're 100% P&T disabled. For veterans rated below 100%, NJ ranks around 25th-30th due to high property taxes and lack of partial exemptions.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- 100% P&T disabled veterans (save $15,000+/year in Bergen/Hudson County)
- Military retirees with pensions over $50,000 (save $2,700-$3,800/year on income tax)
- Disabled veterans with expensive homes (unlimited property tax exemption scales with home value—a $1 million home saves $22,000+/year in Bergen County)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans rated 10-90% disabled (only $250 property tax deduction)
- Veterans without military retirement income (won't benefit from income tax exemption)
- Active duty stationed at Joint Base MDL who maintain out-of-state residency (already exempt from NJ tax)

**Better options:**
- If you're 50-70% disabled and want property tax relief, look at Oklahoma (full exemption for 50%+) or Kansas ($16,744+ exemption for 50%+)
- If you're a military retiree with no disability and want zero income tax, consider Texas, Florida, Nevada, or Tennessee

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- New Jersey estate tax: Repealed in 2016—no state estate tax
- New Jersey inheritance tax: Yes, but immediate family exempt
- Veteran exemptions: None specifically for veterans

New Jersey has no estate tax. However, New Jersey has an inheritance tax (different from an estate tax) that applies to certain beneficiaries:
- **Class A beneficiaries (spouse, children, grandchildren, parents):** Exempt
- **Class C beneficiaries (siblings):** 11-16% tax on amounts over $25,000
- **Class D beneficiaries (everyone else):** 15-16% tax on amounts over $500

There's no special veteran exemption from inheritance tax. This primarily affects beneficiaries who are not immediate family.

### Other Tax Benefits

**Income Tax Exemptions:**
- Social Security: Not taxed by New Jersey (exempt for filers with income under $100,000)
- Railroad retirement: Treated like Social Security (exempt under income thresholds)
- Military retirement: Fully exempt (as discussed)

**Senior Freeze (Property Tax Reimbursement):**
- Available to homeowners 65+ or receiving Social Security disability
- Income limits apply ($156,757 for 2024)
- Reimburses property tax increases after you qualify
- Veterans qualify if they meet age/disability/income requirements

**Veteran Property Tax Deduction ($250):**
- Available to all honorably discharged veterans who served during wartime
- Not income-restricted
- Applies to primary residence only

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Apply for property tax exemption immediately if you're 100% P&T disabled.** File Form D.V.S.S.E. with your municipal tax assessor. Don't wait—you could be losing $1,000+ per month.

2. **Update your New Jersey tax withholding if you're a military retiree.** Since your retirement pay is exempt, adjust your withholding to stop over-withholding New Jersey tax. Contact DFAS to update your state tax withholding.

3. **File for the $250 veteran deduction even though it's small.** Every dollar counts, and the application is simple (Form V.S.S.). Most assessors accept it online.

4. **Check your municipality's additional veteran programs.** Some New Jersey towns offer extra benefits—additional property tax relief, veteran assistance programs, etc. Contact your local Veterans Service Officer.

5. **Consider buying in a lower-tax county if you don't qualify for the exemption.** Cumberland, Atlantic, and Cape May counties have lower property tax bills than Bergen, Morris, and Hunterdon. A $300,000 home in Cumberland County costs $6,390/year in taxes vs. $13,110 for a $575,000 home in Bergen County.

6. **Apply for Senior Freeze if you're 65+.** Even if you're exempt from property taxes, your spouse may benefit if they inherit the home and don't qualify for the surviving spouse exemption.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not understanding the P&T requirement:** Only 100% **permanent and total** disabled veterans qualify for the full property tax exemption. A 100% temporary rating doesn't qualify. Check your VA award letter.

- **Forgetting to notify DFAS about New Jersey tax exemption:** Update your withholding to keep more money in your paycheck. Many retirees over-withhold and get a big refund—get your money now instead.

- **Assuming 70% or 80% disabled qualifies:** New Jersey only offers full exemption to 100% P&T disabled. If you're rated 70-90%, you get the same $250 deduction as all other veterans.

- **Claiming the $250 deduction on rental property:** The deduction applies to your primary residence only. Investment properties don't qualify.

- **Missing local application deadlines:** While the 100% P&T exemption can be filed anytime, the $250 veteran deduction has municipal deadlines (often before October 1). Check with your assessor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?**

A: No. Once approved for the 100% P&T disabled veteran exemption, it remains in effect as long as you own and occupy the home and maintain your 100% P&T status. If your disability status changes, notify your assessor immediately.

**Q: Can I get the property tax exemption if I'm 90% disabled?**

A: No. Only 100% permanently and totally disabled veterans qualify for the full exemption. Veterans rated 10-90% receive only the $250 annual deduction.

**Q: Does the property tax exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. It only applies to your primary residence (homestead) that you own and occupy.

**Q: I just retired from the military. How do I make sure New Jersey doesn't tax my retirement pay?**

A: When you file your New Jersey state tax return (NJ-1040), exclude military retirement income from your gross income. If you use tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block, indicate that your 1099-R is military retirement. New Jersey won't tax it.

**Q: Can I get both the 100% disabled veteran property tax exemption AND the $250 veteran deduction?**

A: No. If you receive the full exemption (100% P&T), you're already exempt from all property taxes, so the $250 deduction is irrelevant. The $250 deduction is for veterans who don't qualify for the full exemption.

**Q: Do I pay property tax while my exemption application is being processed?**

A: Yes, but if approved, the exemption is retroactive to January 1 of the tax year you applied (if you filed before the tax bill was issued). You may receive a refund.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled due to PTSD. Do I qualify for the property tax exemption?**

A: Yes, if you're rated 100% **permanent and total**. The exemption applies to any 100% P&T service-connected disability, regardless of the condition. It doesn't have to be physical. Check your VA award letter to confirm it says "P&T."

**Q: Does New Jersey tax VA disability compensation?**

A: No. VA disability compensation is tax-free federally and in every state, including New Jersey.

**Q: I'm stationed at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst but my home of record is Florida. Do I pay New Jersey income tax?**

A: No, as long as you maintain Florida residency. Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), you're not subject to New Jersey income tax on your military pay if you're a legal resident of another state.

**Q: Does my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption if I die?**

A: Yes, if you were 100% P&T disabled at the time of death. Your surviving spouse retains the exemption as long as they remain unmarried and continue to own and occupy the home. The exemption can transfer to a new home.

**Q: Are National Guard and Reserve retirement payments exempt from New Jersey income tax?**

A: Yes. Guard and Reserve retirement (including "grey area" retired pay after age 60) is treated the same as active duty retirement—fully exempt from New Jersey state tax.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I overpaid property taxes before I knew about the exemption?**

A: Generally, exemptions apply prospectively (from the date you apply forward). Some municipalities may grant retroactive relief for the current tax year if you apply before the bill is issued. For prior years, it's unlikely, but consult your municipal tax assessor.

**Q: If I move to New Jersey mid-year, can I still get the property tax exemption?**

A: Yes, but you must establish New Jersey residency and apply with your municipal assessor. The exemption typically applies starting the tax year you establish residency and file the application.

**Q: Does New Jersey tax federal civil service retirement?**

A: Yes. Federal civil service pensions (OPM pensions) are taxable in New Jersey, even if the pension includes credit for military service. Only direct military retirement from the Department of Defense is exempt.

**Q: What's the difference between the disabled veteran property tax exemption and the Senior Freeze?**

A: The disabled veteran exemption (100% P&T) fully exempts your property from all property taxes with no income limits. The Senior Freeze is a reimbursement program for seniors 65+ or disabled residents that freezes your property tax at a baseline year—it has income limits ($156,757 for 2024) and doesn't eliminate your taxes, just prevents increases.

**Q: I'm a 100% P&T disabled veteran. Do I qualify for free vehicle registration?**

A: Not yet. Legislation is pending (as of 2025) that would provide free vehicle registration for 100% P&T disabled veterans, but it's not currently law. You still pay standard registration fees.

**Q: Can I use disabled veteran parking meter exemption anywhere in New Jersey?**

A: The exemption applies to municipal parking meters (operated by towns/cities). It does not apply to private parking lots, garages, or parking meters operated by private entities. Check local ordinances—some municipalities may have additional restrictions.
