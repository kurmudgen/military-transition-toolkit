## Bottom Line Up Front

**Military Sexual Trauma (MST) causes PTSD that qualifies for VA disability compensation.** Veterans who experienced sexual harassment, assault, or rape during military service can file for service-connected PTSD without traditional combat exposure documentation. MST-related PTSD claims have unique evidence requirements: focus on psychological impact documentation and proof that trauma occurred during service (not on how you prove trauma happened). Processing time 120-180 days; approval rates 60-75% with proper documentation. MST claims generally rate 20-70% depending on symptom severity; combined ratings reach 60-90% if multiple conditions present.

## What Is Military Sexual Trauma (MST)?

### Definition
Military Sexual Trauma (MST) includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape occurring during military service. VA recognizes MST as service-stressing event warranting PTSD service connection.

### Important Notes
- **No combat required**: MST veterans don't need combat exposure for PTSD service connection
- **Harassment counts**: Repeated sexual harassment qualifies, not just single assault
- **During service**: Must occur during military service (not before or after)
- **Psychological impact**: Focus on PTSD from trauma, not proving trauma itself to VA
- **Gender-neutral**: Applies to male and female service members
- **Increasing prevalence**: MST recognized growing issue in modern military

## Eligibility Requirements

### Primary Requirement: PTSD Symptoms

**PTSD Diagnosis:**
- Medical diagnosis of PTSD resulting from MST
- Diagnosed by VA or private mental health provider
- Medical records documenting PTSD diagnosis and symptoms

**PTSD Symptoms Related to Trauma:**
- Intrusive thoughts/memories of MST incident
- Nightmares related to trauma
- Avoidance of trauma reminders
- Hyperarousal (hypervigilance, startle response, irritability)
- Emotional numbing/changes in mood related to trauma
- Sleep disturbance from trauma

### Secondary Requirement: Proof Trauma Occurred During Service

**Important Note:** You don't have to prove to VA exactly what happened or provide graphic details. You must establish trauma occurred during service. Different standards than proving it to law enforcement.

**Acceptable Evidence of MST:**
- Personal statement describing incident occurred during service (vague details acceptable: time period, location type, not detailed description required)
- Statements from fellow service members confirming you disclosed MST to them
- Mental health treatment records mentioning MST/trauma
- Military medical records from time of incident (even if not labeled MST)
- Occupational medicine records, clinic visits around time of incident
- VA recognizes trauma occurred if reasonable evidence supports claim

**VA Standard (Lower Than Legal):**
- "Credible evidence" that trauma occurred during service
- VA doesn't require court conviction or police report
- VA considers: "Would reasonable person believe this occurred?"
- Inconsistencies in account acceptable (trauma memory often fragmented)
- Single corroborating source often sufficient

## Evidence Requirements and Documentation

### Critical Documentation

**Medical Evidence of PTSD:**
- Psychiatrist or psychologist PTSD diagnosis
- Mental health treatment records documenting PTSD from MST
- Provider explicitly links PTSD to MST trauma

**Timeline of Trauma and Treatment:**
- When trauma occurred (approximate date/time period during service)
- When PTSD symptoms began
- Treatment documentation over time

**Statements Supporting Trauma Occurred:**
- Your personal statement describing incident (VA accepts vague descriptions)
- Buddy statements: fellow service members describing you disclosing trauma
- Medical provider notes mentioning trauma/MST
- Therapist notes documenting trauma narrative

### Supporting Documentation

**Personal Statement**
- Description of when trauma occurred (service location, rough date, time period)
- Immediate aftermath: who you told, how you coped, what happened next
- PTSD symptoms following trauma: nightmares, hyperarousal, emotional effects
- How trauma affected your military service and post-service life
- **Note:** VA doesn't require detailed graphic description; focus on psychological impact

**Fellow Service Member Statements**
- Statements from people who knew you during service
- Descriptions of you disclosing trauma to them
- Observations of behavioral changes after trauma
- Examples: "She told me she was sexually assaulted by [officer]; she seemed traumatized"
- Multiple statements strengthen claim

**Medical Documentation**
- Any medical records from time of incident (clinic visits, hospital records, pregnancy tests, STI tests, etc.)
- Even if records don't explicitly mention assault, visits around time of incident corroborate trauma
- Mental health records mentioning trauma/MST
- Any disciplinary records referencing incident

## MST-Specific Filing Considerations

### VA's Approach to Proof of Trauma

**Veteran-Friendly Standard:**
- VA recognizes trauma memory often fragmented/inconsistent
- VA doesn't require detailed, consistent narrative
- VA recognizes victims often don't report incidents
- VA doesn't deny claims for lack of "perfect" evidence
- Approach: present best evidence available; inconsistencies don't automatically disqualify

### What VA Doesn't Require

- Police report or criminal charges
- Court conviction
- Incident report filed with military
- Detailed graphic description of incident
- Medical treatment at time of incident (though helpful if available)
- Accused person's statement or acknowledgment
- Prosecution/convictionof offender

### What VA Does Consider

- Credible account of incident (consistent with your account, coherent)
- Reasonable evidence corroborating trauma occurred
- Psychological impact documented in medical records
- PTSD symptoms logically connected to trauma

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Obtain PTSD Diagnosis (Weeks 1-6)

**From VA:**
- Schedule appointment with VA mental health
- Disclose MST (you can mention it was military sexual trauma without detailed description)
- Request PTSD evaluation
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks for appointment + evaluation

**From Private Provider:**
- Schedule with psychiatrist or psychologist
- Disclose MST and resulting PTSD
- Request formal PTSD diagnosis
- Cost: $500-1,500
- Timeline: 1-3 weeks

**Recommended:** Both VA and private diagnosis if possible (strengthens claim)

### Step 2: Prepare Personal Narrative (Week 7)

**Personal Statement Components:**
1. **Timeframe:** When during your service did trauma occur?
2. **Location:** Where were you stationed? (No need to name specific offender)
3. **Nature of incident:** Can be vague: "sexual assault," "sexual harassment," "unwanted sexual contact"
4. **Immediate psychological response:** How did trauma affect you immediately?
5. **Ongoing PTSD symptoms:** Nightmares, hyperarousal, avoidance, emotional effects
6. **Post-service impact:** How trauma continues affecting you

**Example Narrative:**
"During my service at [base name] in 2010, I experienced a military sexual assault. Shortly after, I developed severe PTSD symptoms: nightmares about incident, hypervigilance, severe anxiety. I sought mental health treatment through VA in 2015, where psychiatrist diagnosed PTSD from sexual trauma. PTSD symptoms persist: intrusive thoughts about incident, hyperarousal in public, difficulty maintaining relationships. This service-connected PTSD has severely impaired my functioning and employment."

### Step 3: Gather Corroborating Statements (Weeks 4-8)

**Identify Potential Corroborators:**
- Fellow service members who you disclosed to
- Close friends who you told about trauma
- Family members who observed PTSD symptoms
- Coworkers who noted behavioral changes

**Request Written Statements:**
- Ask them to write statement describing:
  - When you disclosed MST to them (approximate date)
  - What you told them about incident
  - Changes they observed in your behavior
  - PTSD symptoms they witnessed
- Specific example statement: "In 2010, [your name] disclosed to me that he experienced sexual assault during military service. He seemed traumatized; I noticed hypervigilance and nightmares affecting him. This changed him significantly."

### Step 4: Gather Medical Records (Weeks 2-6)

**From VA:**
- Request complete mental health records
- Request all medical records from time of incident (clinic visits, appointments around trauma timeframe)
- These corroborate trauma occurred even if not explicitly documented

**From Private Providers:**
- Recent mental health treatment records with PTSD diagnosis
- Medical records if you sought treatment privately

### Step 5: Prepare Claim (Week 9)

**Use Form 21-0960 (Standard Disability Claim for PTSD):**
- Service-connected condition: PTSD secondary to Military Sexual Trauma
- Describe: "Service-connected PTSD resulting from military sexual trauma occurring during military service"
- Provide narrative explaining trauma and PTSD development

**Sample Narrative:**
"I am claiming service-connected PTSD resulting from military sexual trauma (MST). During my service, I experienced sexual assault/harassment. This trauma resulted in PTSD diagnosis. I am providing personal statement describing incident and PTSD symptoms, corroborating statements from fellow service members, and mental health records documenting PTSD diagnosis. Although I was not in a combat situation, VA recognizes MST-related PTSD as service-connected."

### Step 6: Compile Complete Package (Week 10)

**MST PTSD Claim Package:**
1. Form 21-0960
2. Personal statement describing MST and PTSD impact
3. PTSD diagnosis from VA and/or private provider
4. Mental health treatment records
5. Corroborating statements (buddy statements, family, friends)
6. Medical records from time of incident (if available)
7. Timeline of PTSD symptom development
8. **Optional but helpful:** Family statement describing PTSD impact

### Step 7: File Claim (Week 11)

**File at VA.gov or mail to VA Regional Office**

**Important:** MST claims typically don't require nexus letter (VA recognizes MST-PTSD nexus). However, strong mental health provider statement supporting MST-caused PTSD is helpful if available.

## Timeline and Examples

### Processing: 120-180 Days (Longer than combat PTSD)

**Longer timeline due to:**
- Need to verify trauma occurred during service (no combat documentation)
- Evaluation of corroborating statements
- Mental health evaluation

### Success Example: Veteran Johnson (MST PTSD Approved 40%)

**Background:** Female service member, experienced sexual assault during service, delayed claiming until 15 years post-service.

**Claim Details:**
- MST: Sexual assault by superior officer 1998 during service
- PTSD diagnosis: Diagnosed by VA psychiatrist 2010 (12 years post-incident)
- Personal statement: Narrative describing incident occurred 1998 at [base name], immediate trauma response, ongoing PTSD
- Corroboration: Buddy statement from fellow service member describing claimant disclosing assault within months of incident; family statement describing claimant's hypervigilance, nightmares, anxiety years after service
- Medical records: None from time of incident, but mental health records from 2010 onward documenting PTSD

**Outcome:** Service-connected PTSD from MST approved, 40% rating. Monthly compensation: ~$913. Retroactive payment: $16,434 (covering 18-month approval period).

**Success Factors:** Clear personal narrative; corroborating buddy statement; consistent mental health documentation; VA's willingness to approve MST-PTSD even without incident reports

## Common MST Claim Mistakes

### 1. Overly Graphic Descriptions
**Mistake:** Feeling obligated to describe assault in extreme detail.

**Fix:** VA doesn't require graphic details. Brief, clinical description sufficient: "sexual assault," "unwanted sexual contact," "sexual harassment." Focus on psychological impact instead.

### 2. Inconsistent Accounts
**Mistake:** Worrying that memory inconsistencies will disqualify claim.

**Fix:** Trauma memory often fragmented/inconsistent. VA understands this. Inconsistencies don't automatically disqualify; focus on overall credibility.

### 3. Delayed Seeking Treatment
**Mistake:** Assuming delayed treatment seeking indicates claim weakness.

**Fix:** Many MST survivors delay treatment for years/decades. VA understands PTSD can be delayed; delayed treatment doesn't disqualify claims.

### 4. No Incident Report
**Mistake:** Assuming VA won't approve without military incident report or police report.

**Fix:** VA approves many MST claims without reports. Criminal justice standards don't apply. VA's credible evidence standard is lower.

### 5. Limited Corroboration
**Mistake:** Assuming you need multiple independent corroborators.

**Fix:** Even single buddy statement often sufficient if credible. Family statements also help. VA doesn't require extensive corroboration.

### 6. Isolation from Others
**Mistake:** Not disclosing MST to anyone during/after service, then having no one to corroborate.

**Fix:** File anyway. Your personal statement plus mental health records documenting PTSD often sufficient. Perfect corroboration not required.

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to report the assault to military or police?
**A:** No. Filing VA claim doesn't require reporting. You can file for PTSD benefits even if you didn't report assault at the time.

### Q: Can I file if I'm still on active duty?
**A:** Yes. You can file while still serving. Processing happens after separation typically, but filing before separation acceptable.

### Q: What if the person who assaulted me is still military?
**A:** You can still file for PTSD benefits. VA claim is separate from any military justice proceedings. Filing claim doesn't require confronting offender.

### Q: Does my claim go to the offender or their chain of command?
**A:** No. VA disability claims are confidential. Your claim doesn't trigger investigations or notifications to offender or chain of command.

### Q: Can I file MST claim if offender was denyed/not convicted?
**A:** Yes. Criminal justice outcomes don't affect VA claims. VA uses credible evidence standard, not criminal law standard. Many approvals occur without offender conviction.

### Q: How is MST different from combat PTSD?
**A:** MST-PTSD doesn't require combat exposure. VA recognizes MST (non-combat trauma) as service-connected stressor. MST claims don't require combat documentation.
