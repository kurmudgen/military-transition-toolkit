# VA Rating for Shoulder Pain and Rotator Cuff: Complete Disability Guide

Shoulder injuries, particularly rotator cuff tears, represent significant service-connected disabilities affecting many veterans. Military service creates shoulder injuries through combat trauma, repetitive stress from weapons handling, heavy equipment carrying, and occupational demands. Understanding VA rating criteria, compensation amounts, and evidence requirements is essential for securing the disability benefits you've earned.

## Understanding Shoulder and Rotator Cuff Injuries

Military service causes shoulder injuries through:

**Combat**: Blast injuries, falls, direct trauma to shoulder region

**Weapons Training**: Repetitive rifle firing creating shoulder stress, recoil injuries

**Equipment Carrying**: Heavy load carrying during operations, ruck marches with combat equipment

**Occupational Duties**: Mechanics, pilots, and personnel with overhead arm demands

**Training Accidents**: Jump training, close-quarters combat training, equipment mishaps

**Structural Injuries**: Rotator cuff tears, labral tears, cartilage damage, fractures

### Rotator Cuff Anatomy

The rotator cuff comprises four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis) stabilizing the shoulder joint. Tears in these tendons cause:
- Pain with overhead activities
- Weakness with arm lifting
- Limited range of motion
- Functional disability with specific movements
- Potential for complete loss of shoulder function if untreated

The VA recognizes both acute rotator cuff tears and degenerative shoulder conditions as service-connected when evidence supports military causation.

## VA Rating System for Shoulder Conditions

The VA rates shoulder conditions using multiple diagnostic codes:
- **DC 5200**: Shoulder, limitation of motion of
- **DC 5201**: Shoulder, dislocation of
- **DC 5202**: Acromioclavicular arthritis
- **DC 5003**: Arthritis, hypertrophic (shoulder)

Rating is based on functional limitation and range of motion rather than diagnosis alone.

### Rating Percentages and Criteria

**0% (Not Rated)** - No functional limitation despite possible shoulder condition

**10% Rating** - Slight functional limitation:
- Occasional pain with strenuous activity
- Full or near-full range of motion
- No significant weakness
- Minimal impact on work capacity
- No movement restrictions

**20% Rating** - Mild functional limitation:
- Pain with moderate to heavy activity
- Slight range of motion limitation (10-15%)
- Mild weakness with specific movements
- Minimal work restrictions
- Can perform most occupational duties

**30% Rating** - Moderate functional limitation:
- Pain with daily activities
- Range of motion limitation 15-30%
- Notable weakness with overhead activities
- Some occupational restrictions
- Limited with certain arm positions

**40% Rating** - Moderately severe functional limitation:
- Constant or near-constant pain
- Range of motion limitation 30-40%
- Significant weakness limiting work
- Cannot perform overhead activities
- Substantial occupational impact

**50% Rating** - Severe functional limitation:
- Constant pain even at rest
- Range of motion limitation 40-50%
- Severe weakness/near paralysis of arm
- Unable to work in occupational field
- Major functional disability

**60%-100% Rating** - Very severe to total disability:
- Severe functional impairment
- May require surgery or special accommodations
- Often combined with other conditions

## Monthly Compensation for Shoulder Conditions

Monthly compensation varies by rating percentage and dependent status. As of 2025:

**10% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $175-$185/month

**20% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $253-$270/month

**30% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $330-$350/month

**40% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $470-$490/month

**50% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $605-$625/month

These amounts increase annually with COLA. Combined ratings with other disabilities increase total compensation.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: No Imaging Evidence
Filing without MRI or X-rays significantly weakens claims.

**Solution**: Obtain comprehensive shoulder imaging before filing.

### Mistake 2: Vague Functional Impact
Simply saying "shoulder pain" doesn't justify higher ratings.

**Solution**: Be specific: "Can't lift above shoulder height," "Can't throw a ball."

### Mistake 3: Missing Specialist Evaluation
Filing without orthopedic assessment weakens moderate-to-severe claims.

**Solution**: See VA or civilian orthopedic surgeon before filing.

### Mistake 4: Poor Nexus Letter Quality
Weak nexus reduces approval chances.

**Solution**: Get nexus letter from experienced orthopedic provider.

### Mistake 5: No Treatment Documentation
Lack of treatment suggests minor condition.

**Solution**: Continue physical therapy or relevant treatments.
