**State Approving Agency:**

Virginia has a State Approving Agency (SAA) that certifies schools for GI Bill benefits:
Phone: (804) 786-0286
Email: saa@dvs.virginia.gov

### Comparing Education Benefits

**If You're a Dependent of a 90%+ Disabled or KIA Veteran:**
**USE VMSDEP** - It covers 100% of tuition and fees at Virginia public schools with no out-of-pocket cost and doesn't use your GI Bill benefits.

**If You're the Veteran:**
**Use Post-9/11 GI Bill** - Covers tuition, provides MHA, and gives books stipend. Combine with any state grants or scholarships.

**If You're a Dependent Using DEA or Fry:**
**Get in-state tuition first** under Veterans Choice Act, then use DEA/Fry to pay that in-state rate plus receive MHA.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Healthcare Questions

**Q: I'm a veteran but never enrolled in VA healthcare. Can I enroll now?**

A: Yes! Enrollment is always open. Call 1-877-222-8387 or visit any VA medical center enrollment office. Bring your DD-214 and prepare to provide information about service history, financial information (for copay determination), and current medications.

**Q: I have private insurance. Should I still enroll in VA healthcare?**

A: Yes. Enrolling in VA healthcare gives you access to VA services even if you primarily use private insurance. Many veterans use both—private insurance for routine care and VA for service-connected conditions or VA-specific programs (PTSD treatment, TBI clinics, etc.).

**Q: How long does VA healthcare enrollment take?**

A: Same-day enrollment is common. Walk into any VA enrollment office with your DD-214 and you can often be enrolled within 1-2 hours. Remote enrollment (phone/online) takes 3-5 business days.

**Q: What are VA healthcare copays?**

A: Copays depend on service connection, income, and priority group:
- Veterans with 50%+ service-connected disability: $0 copays for all care
- Veterans with 10-40% service-connected disability: $0 copays for service-connected conditions
- Higher income veterans without service connection: $15-$50 copays for primary care, $50 for specialty care, $11 for generic medications

**Q: Can I use VA healthcare if I move between Virginia cities?**

A: Yes. Once enrolled, you can receive care at any VA facility nationwide. If you move, update your address with VA and request transfer to the nearest facility for primary care.

**Q: Does VA dental cover all dental work?**

A: Limited. VA dental is generally only for service-connected dental conditions or 100% disabled veterans. Most veterans need private dental insurance or pay out-of-pocket.

**Q: I need mental health care urgently. How fast can I get an appointment?**

A: All three Virginia VA medical centers offer same-day mental health walk-in clinics during business hours. For immediate crisis: call 988, press 1 (24/7 Veterans Crisis Line) or go to any VA emergency department.

### Education Questions

**Q: My dad is 90% disabled by VA. Do I qualify for VMSDEP?**

A: Yes! Children of veterans rated 90%+ permanently disabled qualify for VMSDEP (free tuition at Virginia public colleges). Apply at vmsdep.dvs.virginia.gov at least 90 days before your semester starts.

**Q: Can I use VMSDEP and GI Bill together?**

A: VMSDEP covers tuition/fees completely. If you also have GI Bill benefits, save them for graduate school, use them for living expenses (BAH), or transfer them to another family member if using Post-9/11 GI Bill with transfer eligibility.

**Q: I'm using Post-9/11 GI Bill at Virginia Tech. Do I automatically get in-state tuition?**

A: Not automatically. You must inform Virginia Tech that you're using GI Bill benefits and living in Virginia. The school will then charge you the in-state rate. Contact the Veterans Certifying Official at your school.

**Q: Does VMSDEP cover room and board?**

A: VMSDEP covers tuition and mandatory fees completely. You may receive a one-time stipend per semester (around $1,500-$2,500) toward room, board, and books, but this doesn't fully cover housing costs. Budget for housing separately.

**Q: I'm a veteran AND my dad was a 90% disabled veteran. Which education benefit should I use?**

A: Use your own GI Bill. VMSDEP is for dependents whose parent is the disabled veteran. You can't use VMSDEP based on your parent's service if you're a veteran with your own service.

**Q: Can Virginia residents attend community college for free using VMSDEP?**

A: If you're eligible for VMSDEP (dependent of 90%+ disabled or KIA veteran), yes—it covers all tuition and fees at Virginia's 23 community colleges for up to 8 semesters.

**Q: I'm attending George Mason University on the Post-9/11 GI Bill. What's my housing allowance?**

A: For full-time students at GMU in 2024-2025, the monthly housing allowance (MHA) is $2,763/month. You receive this for each month you're enrolled (September-May for fall/spring semesters = 9 months = $24,867 academic year).

### Employment Questions

**Q: What is V3 and how does it help me find a job?**

A: Virginia Values Veterans (V3) is a state program that certifies Virginia employers as veteran-friendly and connects veterans with jobs. V3 Employer Liaisons help match your skills with V3-certified companies. Contact V3@dvs.virginia.gov or call (804) 786-0286.

**Q: Do I need a security clearance to work for defense contractors?**

A: Not always, but clearances significantly increase hiring opportunities and salary. Many entry positions are "clearable" (company sponsors your clearance after hiring). Having an active Secret or Top Secret clearance makes you immediately more valuable.

**Q: How do I translate my MOS to civilian jobs?**

A: Use these resources:
- Military Skills Translator: mynextmove.org/vets
- O*NET Military Crosswalk: onetonline.org/crosswalk/MOC
- V3 Program: V3@dvs.virginia.gov (free skills translation assistance)

**Q: What's the average defense contractor salary in Northern Virginia?**

A: Varies widely by role and clearance:
- Entry-level with Secret clearance: $70,000-$90,000
- Mid-level with Top Secret: $110,000-$150,000
- Senior with TS/SCI + polygraph: $150,000-$220,000+

**Q: Are there veteran hiring preferences for Virginia state government jobs?**

A: Yes. Virginia gives preference to veterans in state hiring. Veterans with service-connected disabilities receive additional preference. Apply at jobs.virginia.gov and identify yourself as a veteran.

**Q: I'm transitioning soon. When should I start the job search?**

A: Start 6-12 months before separation:
- 12 months out: Attend TAP/TAPS
- 9 months out: Contact V3, update resume, start networking
- 6 months out: Active job applications, interviews
- 3-6 months out: Accept offers, negotiate start dates
- Separation date: Begin terminal leave, start new job

**Q: Does my VA disability rating affect my ability to work?**

A: No. Being rated 100% disabled by VA does not mean you can't work. Many 100% disabled veterans work full-time jobs. Your VA disability compensation continues regardless of employment (unlike Social Security disability).

### Benefits Coordination Questions

**Q: Can I use both VA healthcare and TRICARE?**

A: Yes, if you're eligible for both (retirees, some Guard/Reserve). You can use TRICARE as primary insurance and VA as supplemental, or vice versa. VA and TRICARE cannot bill each other, so choose which system to use for each specific care need.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled. Do I get free vehicle registration in Virginia?**

A: No registration fee waiver, but you qualify for FREE Disabled Veteran license plates, which come with benefits like free parking at metered spaces. You also qualify for personal property tax exemption on one vehicle. Apply at Virginia DMV.

**Q: Are there any veteran hunting and fishing license discounts in Virginia?**

A: Yes. 100% disabled veterans and Purple Heart recipients get FREE hunting and fishing licenses for life in Virginia. Contact Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources: (804) 367-1000 or dwr.virginia.gov.

**Q: Can I get free legal assistance as a veteran in Virginia?**

A: Virginia has Veterans Legal Clinics offering free legal assistance. Contact:
- Virginia State Bar Veterans Benefits Section
- Legal Aid Society locations throughout Virginia
- Call 211 Virginia and say "veteran legal assistance"

**Q: My vehicle property taxes are still being billed. What do I do?**

A: Contact your local Commissioner of the Revenue immediately. If you're 100% disabled by VA and applied for the exemption, provide proof of application. They can issue refunds for incorrectly billed taxes. If you haven't applied, apply immediately to stop future bills.
