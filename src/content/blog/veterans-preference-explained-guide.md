# Veterans Preference Explained: 5-Point, 10-Point, CPS, and XP Decoded

Veterans preference isn't just a nice gesture—it's a legal requirement that can determine whether you get hired over an equally qualified non-veteran.

But here's the problem: most veterans don't fully understand how preference works, which types they qualify for, or how to properly claim it. Some veterans have 10-point preference and don't even know it. Others claim preference they're not entitled to and get disqualified.

This guide explains every type of veterans preference, shows you exactly how to determine what you qualify for, and walks you through the documentation you need.

## What is Veterans Preference?

Veterans preference is a federal hiring benefit established by law since the Civil War era. It gives eligible veterans an advantage in competitive federal hiring.

**How it works:**
1. When agencies fill positions through competitive examination, applicants are scored
2. Eligible veterans get 5 or 10 points added to their passing score
3. Veterans float to the top of hiring lists
4. Agencies must consider veterans before non-veterans with the same score

**Important:** Veterans preference applies to competitive service positions. It doesn't apply to:
- Senior Executive Service (SES)
- Excepted service positions (usually)
- Positions filled through merit promotion (internal candidates)
- Direct hire authority positions

But even when preference doesn't apply directly, being a veteran often helps through other hiring authorities.

## The Two Main Categories: 5-Point and 10-Point

### 5-Point Preference (TP)

5-point preference is for veterans who served during certain war periods but don't have a service-connected disability.

**Eligibility requirements:**
- Served on active duty during a war, campaign, or expedition for which a campaign badge was authorized, OR
- Served on active duty during specific periods defined by law

**Specific qualifying service periods include:**
- Gulf War (August 2, 1990 – present)
- Panama (December 20, 1989 – January 31, 1990)
- Operation Enduring Freedom
- Operation Iraqi Freedom
- Operation New Dawn
- Any operation receiving Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal

**Additional requirements:**
- Discharged under honorable conditions (honorable or general)
- No service-connected disability rating from VA

**Documentation needed:**
- DD-214 (Member 4 copy) showing dates and character of service

### 10-Point Preference

10-point preference provides a stronger advantage and has several subcategories:

#### CP (Compensable Disability, Less than 30%)
**Eligibility:**
- Service-connected disability rated at least 10% but less than 30%

**Documentation:**
- SF-15 (Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference)
- VA disability rating letter

#### CPS (Compensable Disability, 30% or More)
**Eligibility:**
- Service-connected disability rated at 30% or more

**Benefits:**
- 10 points added to score
- **Pass over protection:** Agency must get OPM approval to pass over a CPS eligible in favor of a non-preference eligible
- Access to 30% or more disabled veteran hiring authority (direct hire)

**Documentation:**
- SF-15
- VA disability rating letter showing 30%+ rating

#### XP (Derived Preference)
**Eligibility for spouses:**
- Spouse of a veteran with service-connected disability that disqualifies them from civil service employment
- Spouse of a veteran who died while on active duty
- Spouse of a veteran who died from service-connected disability

**Eligibility for mothers:**
- Mother of a veteran who died in service or is permanently and totally disabled
- Mother must be widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father, or married to a permanently disabled spouse

**Documentation:**
- SF-15
- Marriage certificate or birth certificate
- Proof of veteran's death or disability
- Additional documentation depending on specific circumstances

#### SSP (Sole Survivorship Preference)
**Eligibility:**
- Released or discharged from active duty after August 29, 2008
- Released due to Sole Survivorship Discharge (only surviving son or daughter of family where another sibling died while in service)

**Documentation:**
- DD-214 showing Sole Survivorship Discharge
- SF-15

## Detailed Eligibility Requirements

### What Counts as "Honorable Conditions"?

Character of service matters. You need one of these:
- **Honorable discharge** – Qualifies
- **General under honorable conditions** – Qualifies
- **Other than honorable** – Does NOT qualify
- **Bad conduct discharge** – Does NOT qualify
- **Dishonorable discharge** – Does NOT qualify

If you're not sure, check Block 24 of your DD-214.

### What About Reserve and Guard Service?

Reserve and National Guard service counts IF:
- Called to active duty (not just training) under Title 10 orders
- Served 180+ consecutive days of active duty (not counting training)
- Served in a qualifying campaign or operation

**Does NOT count:**
- Initial Active Duty for Training (IADT)
- Annual training
- Inactive duty for training (drills)

### Retired Military Members

Yes, retired military can receive veterans preference, with some restrictions:

**Retired at Major/O-4 or above:**
- Veterans preference only for positions at GS-9 or below
- Cannot receive preference for positions above GS-9

**Retired below Major/O-4:**
- Full veterans preference applies at all grade levels

**Disability retired (regardless of rank):**
- Full veterans preference at all grade levels

## How to Determine Your Preference Category

### Quick Decision Tree

**Step 1: Are you a veteran who served on active duty?**
- Yes → Continue to Step 2
- No → Check XP (derived preference for spouses/mothers)

**Step 2: Was your discharge honorable or general under honorable conditions?**
- Yes → Continue to Step 3
- No → You do not qualify for veterans preference

**Step 3: Do you have a service-connected disability rating from VA?**
- Yes, 30% or higher → **CPS (10-point)**
- Yes, 10-29% → **CP (10-point)**
- No → Continue to Step 4

**Step 4: Did you serve during a qualifying war period or receive a campaign badge?**
- Yes → **TP (5-point)**
- No → You may not qualify for veterans preference

### Common Situations

**Scenario 1: E-5 with 6 years, Gulf War service, no disability**
- Served during Gulf War = qualifies
- No disability rating = 5-point (TP)

**Scenario 2: E-7 with 20 years, 40% VA disability**
- Service-connected disability 30%+ = 10-point (CPS)
- Plus: Eligible for 30% disabled veteran hiring authority

**Scenario 3: Guard member, deployed to Afghanistan, general discharge**
- Active duty deployment (Title 10) = qualifies
- Campaign badge eligible = 5-point (TP)

**Scenario 4: 4-year enlistment, no deployment, honorable discharge, no disability**
- Need to check: Was service during Gulf War period (Aug 2, 1990-present)?
- If yes = 5-point (TP)
- If before Aug 2, 1990 with no campaign service = may not qualify

## The SF-15 Form: When and How to Use It

- CP preference (disability 10-29%)
- CPS preference (disability 30%+)
- XP preference (derived preference)
- SSP preference (sole survivorship)

**Not required for:**
- TP preference (5-point) – DD-214 is sufficient

### How to Complete SF-15

**Part A: Personal Information**
- Full legal name
- Social Security Number (last 4 okay for some agencies)
- Contact information

**Part B: Veteran Information**
- Branch of service
- Service dates
- Campaign badge information
- Discharge type

**Part C: Disability Information**
- VA claim number
- Disability percentage
- Description of disability

**Part D: Derived Preference (XP)**
- Relationship to veteran
- Veteran's information
- Circumstances qualifying you

### Required Attachments

- VA disability rating letter (dated within 1 year)
- DD-214

**For XP preference:**
- SF-15
- Proof of relationship (marriage/birth certificate)
- Death certificate or disability documentation for veteran
- Additional documents based on specific circumstances

**Pro tip:** Keep all documents together in your USAJOBS account for easy attachment.

## How Preference is Applied in Practice

### Competitive Examining

When you apply to a "delegated examining" position (open to all US citizens):

1. All applicants are rated on qualifications (usually 70-100 scale)
2. Those who pass (70+) are ranked
3. Veterans preference points are added to passing scores:
   - 5-point veterans: Add 5 points
   - 10-point veterans: Add 10 points
4. Applicants are placed on certificate in score order
5. Veterans "float" above non-veterans with the same score

**Example:**
- Candidate A (non-veteran): 85 points
- Candidate B (5-point veteran): 82 + 5 = 87 points
- Candidate C (10-point veteran): 80 + 10 = 90 points

Order on certificate: C, B, A

### Category Rating

Many agencies now use "category rating" instead of numerical scores:

1. Applicants are rated as Gold/Silver/Bronze (or similar tiers)
2. Within each category, preference eligibles are listed before non-preference eligibles
3. CPS veterans in top category must be considered first

**Example in Gold category:**
1. CPS veterans (10-point, 30%+ disabled)
2. Other 10-point veterans
3. 5-point veterans
4. Non-preference eligibles

### Pass Over Rights

Agencies can't just skip over veterans. Special rules apply:

**For CPS (30%+ disabled):**
- Agency must request OPM approval to pass over
- OPM reviews and decides
- Strong protection for CPS veterans

**For other preference eligibles:**
- Agency can pass over with documented reasons
- Must maintain record of decision
- Less protection than CPS but still significant

## Veterans Preference vs. Special Hiring Authorities

Understanding the difference is crucial:

### Veterans Preference
- **What it does:** Adds points in competitive hiring
- **When it applies:** Competitive examining process
- **Limitations:** Only works when points are calculated

### Special Hiring Authorities
These let agencies hire veterans non-competitively:

**VRA (Veterans Recruitment Appointment)**
- Hire without competition for GS-11 and below
- Must be within 3 years of discharge (or indefinitely if 30%+ disabled)

**30% or More Disabled Veteran**
- Direct hire authority for ANY position
- No competition required
- Most powerful hiring authority for veterans

**VEOA (Veterans Employment Opportunity Act)**
- Apply to internal merit promotion announcements
- Compete against other VEOA eligibles and internal candidates
- Doesn't add points, but opens closed announcements

**Schedule A (Disability)**
- For veterans with severe disabilities
- Requires certification letter
- Non-competitive hiring

**Key insight:** Use ALL authorities you qualify for. Don't rely on just veterans preference.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Not Claiming Preference at All
Many veterans don't realize they're eligible or forget to claim it.

**Fix:** Check your eligibility and claim preference on EVERY federal application.

### Mistake 2: Claiming Wrong Preference Type
Claiming 10-point when you only qualify for 5-point (or vice versa) can cause problems.

**Fix:** Use the decision tree above. When in doubt, claim 5-point until your VA rating is confirmed.

### Mistake 3: Missing Documentation
Applications rejected for incomplete documentation.

**Fix:** Upload ALL required documents to USAJOBS profile before applying:
- DD-214 (Member 4)
- SF-15 (if claiming 10-point)
- VA disability letter (if applicable)

### Mistake 4: Outdated VA Letter
VA letters should be dated within 1 year for most agencies.

**Fix:** Request a new VA letter through VA.gov or eBenefits before applying.

### Mistake 5: Not Understanding Category Rating
Thinking points are added when category rating is used.

**Fix:** Understand that in category rating, preference works through ordering within categories, not added points.

## How to Get Your VA Disability Letter

## Maximizing Your Preference

### Stack Your Advantages

If you have 30%+ disability rating:
1. Claim CPS preference (10 points)
2. Use 30% disabled veteran hiring authority (direct hire)
3. Apply through VRA (non-competitive)
4. Apply through VEOA (internal announcements)

That's FOUR pathways into the same job.

### Timing Matters

File your VA disability claim BEFORE you start job hunting:
- Claims take 3-6 months (sometimes longer)
- Having a rating letter opens 10-point preference
- Opens 30% disabled veteran authority
- Start your claim 6+ months before separation

### Don't Be Shy

You earned veterans preference through your service. It's not charity—it's compensation for years of service and sacrifice.

Claim every eligibility you're entitled to. Use every authority available. The law is on your side.
