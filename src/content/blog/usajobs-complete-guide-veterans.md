# USAJOBS Complete Guide for Veterans: Land Your Federal Career in 2025

USAJOBS isn't just another job board. It's the gateway to over 2 million federal jobs, and as a veteran, you have advantages most applicants don't even know exist.

But here's the problem: most veterans create a USAJOBS account, upload their resume, and apply to dozens of jobs without ever getting a callback. It's not because they're unqualified—it's because they're playing the game wrong.

Federal hiring works completely differently from civilian hiring. Understanding how USAJOBS actually works will make the difference between your application sitting in a pile of 500 others and landing on a hiring manager's desk as "Best Qualified."

## Why Veterans Have the Upper Hand

Before we dive in, understand this: the federal government **wants** to hire you.

Here's the proof:
- **Veterans' Preference** adds 5 or 10 points to your score on competitive examinations
- **Special Hiring Authorities** like VRA and 30% disabled can bypass the normal competitive process entirely
- **Government-wide veteran hiring goals** put pressure on agencies to increase veteran representation
- **26% of the federal workforce** are veterans (compared to 7% of the general population)

The federal government has legal mandates to hire veterans. Your service isn't just appreciated—it gives you concrete, measurable advantages in the hiring process.

## Step 1: Create Your USAJOBS Account the Right Way

### The Basics
Go to [USAJOBS.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov) and click "Create Profile." You'll need a Login.gov account for authentication—this is the government's unified identity platform.

**Critical tip:** Use a personal email address you'll have for years. Don't use a .mil email—you'll lose access when you separate.

### Profile Completeness Matters

USAJOBS profiles have a "completion percentage." Many veterans stop at 60-70% and wonder why they're not getting referrals.

**Fill out EVERY section:**
- **Contact Information** – Current address matters for locality pay and some location-specific positions
- **Hiring Eligibilities** – This is where your veteran status gives you power (we'll cover this in detail)
- **Demographics** – Optional but completing it helps agencies meet diversity goals
- **Work Experience** – Mirror your resume here
- **Education** – Include military training and schools
- **References** – Federal hiring often checks references before interviews

### Upload Documents Once, Use Them Everywhere

USAJOBS lets you store documents in your profile:
- **Resume** (up to 5)
- **DD-214** (Member 4 copy)
- **SF-15** (if claiming 10-point preference)
- **VA Disability Rating Letter**
- **Transcripts**
- **SF-50** (if you're a current federal employee)
- **Letters of recommendation**

Upload everything relevant once. You'll be able to attach them to any application instantly.

## Step 2: Claim ALL Your Hiring Eligibilities

This is where most veterans leave points on the table.

When you apply to a federal job, you're asked which "hiring eligibilities" you qualify for. Every eligibility you claim is another pathway into the job.

**Veterans must claim ALL that apply:**

### Veterans' Preference (5-Point)
- Served on active duty during specific war periods OR
- Served 180+ consecutive days of active duty service (not training)
- Received an honorable or general discharge
- **Claim this if:** You served during Gulf War, OEF, OIF, OND, or other designated periods

### Veterans' Preference (10-Point)
- Service-connected disability rated by VA
- Purple Heart recipient
- Spouse/parent of a deceased or 100% disabled veteran
- **Documents needed:** SF-15, VA letter confirming disability rating

### VRA (Veterans' Recruitment Appointment)
- Served on active duty for more than 180 days
- Discharged honorably
- Within 3 years of discharge (or indefinitely if 30%+ disabled)
- **Why it matters:** Agencies can hire you non-competitively for positions up to GS-11

### 30% or More Disabled Veteran
- VA disability rating of 30% or higher
- **Why it matters:** Agencies can hire you directly for ANY position without competition

### VEOA (Veterans' Employment Opportunity Act)
- Preference eligible OR
- Completed 3+ years of continuous active service under honorable conditions
- **Why it matters:** Lets you apply to internal merit promotion positions that are closed to the public

### Schedule A (for disabilities)
- If you have a severe physical, psychiatric, or intellectual disability
- Requires certification letter from VA, licensed medical provider, or vocational rehabilitation
- **Why it matters:** Another non-competitive hiring path

**Pro tip:** Claim every single eligibility you qualify for. More pathways = more chances to get referred.

## Step 3: Build a Federal Resume That Gets Referred

Your civilian resume won't cut it. Federal resumes are different animals entirely.

### Length Requirements
- **Federal resumes are typically 3-6 pages**
- Include EVERYTHING relevant
- No one-page limit like civilian jobs
- The automated system (USA Staffing) looks for specific keywords and experience

### What to Include for EVERY Position

Each job entry needs:
- **Exact dates of employment** (month/year to month/year)
- **Hours per week** (40 for full-time, actual hours for part-time)
- **Supervisor name and phone number** (or indicate if they may be contacted)
- **Salary** (yes, really)
- **Detailed description of duties** (use bullet points, be specific)
- **Accomplishments with metrics** when possible

### Example: Bad vs. Good Job Entry

**Bad:**
> Infantry Team Leader, US Army, 2019-2023
> Led a team of soldiers in combat operations

**Good:**
> Infantry Team Leader (MOS 11B) | US Army | Fort Bragg, NC
> March 2019 – June 2023 | 50+ hours/week | Final Grade: E-5 (SGT)
> Supervisor: SSG John Smith | Phone: (555) 123-4567 | May Contact: Yes
> Salary: $52,000/year including BAH/BAS
>
> - Led, trained, and supervised a 4-person fire team responsible for tactical operations, equipment maintenance, and mission execution
> - Planned and executed 45+ combat patrols, managing risk assessment, route planning, and coordination with adjacent units
> - Maintained accountability for $350,000+ in mission-critical equipment with zero loss or damage
> - Trained and mentored junior soldiers on weapons proficiency, land navigation, and tactical communications
> - Achieved 100% personnel readiness rate through proactive management of medical, dental, and administrative requirements
> - Coordinated logistics for squad operations including ammunition, transportation, and supplies for 9-person element
> - Received Army Commendation Medal for leadership during combat operations in [location]

### Translate Your Military Experience

Use the [Military Crosswalk Search](https://www.careeronestop.org/Veterans/Toolkit/military-crosswalk.aspx) or [O*NET](https://www.onetonline.org) to translate your MOS/rating to civilian terms.

**Examples:**
- "Maintained sensitive items" → "Managed inventory and accountability for classified equipment and materials"
- "Conducted PCI/PCCs" → "Implemented quality control inspections ensuring mission readiness"
- "Led PT" → "Designed and executed physical fitness programs for groups of 10-50 personnel"

### Keywords Are Everything

Federal resumes are initially screened by HR specialists using the job announcement's qualification requirements as a checklist. If the announcement says they need "experience with project management," your resume needs to say "project management"—not "managed projects."

**Keyword strategy:**
1. Read the job announcement carefully
2. Identify required qualifications and specialized experience
3. Mirror that exact language in your resume
4. Provide specific examples for each requirement

## Step 4: Answer Assessment Questions Strategically

After submitting your resume, you'll face an occupational questionnaire—multiple choice and sometimes short-answer questions about your qualifications.

### How Scoring Works
- Your answers generate a score (usually 0-100)
- HR then compares your resume to verify your answers
- Inflated answers without resume support = disqualification

### The Strategy
Rate yourself at the highest level **you can fully support with your resume.**

If the question asks: "How much experience do you have with data analysis?"
- A: No experience
- B: Basic familiarity
- C: Performed independently
- D: Expert level, trained others

If you've done data analysis and trained soldiers on using analysis tools, select D—and make sure your resume clearly shows this.

**Don't be modest.** If you can do it, claim it. But don't lie—your application will be reviewed.

### Short Answer Tips
- Be specific and concise
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Include metrics when possible
- Reference specific positions from your resume

## Step 5: Search and Apply Strategically

### Search Filters That Matter

**Location flexibility wins:**
- DC Metro area has the most federal jobs
- Texas, California, Florida, and Virginia also have major concentrations
- Remote work is increasingly available—filter for "Remote" or "Telework Eligible"

**Agency targeting:**
- DoD and VA are veteran-friendly by culture and mission
- DHS, DOJ, and Treasury have law enforcement opportunities
- Any agency with a national security mission values your clearance

**Series numbers:**
- 0080 - Security Administration
- 0301 - Miscellaneous Administration and Program
- 0343 - Management Analyst
- 0346 - Logistics Management
- 0391 - Telecommunications
- 1102 - Contract Specialist
- 2210 - Information Technology

Search by series numbers for more targeted results.

### Saved Searches and Notifications

Set up saved searches with email notifications. New federal positions post daily, and competitive positions fill quickly.

Create multiple saved searches:
- One for your ideal position
- One broader search for related positions
- One for specific agencies you're targeting
- One for your geographic preferences

### Application Volume

**Apply broadly but strategically:**
- Federal hiring takes 2-6 months (sometimes longer)
- Apply to 20-50 positions over several months
- Track your applications in a spreadsheet
- Follow up after 30 days if no response

## Step 6: After You Apply

### Status Tracking

USAJOBS shows application status:
- **Received** – Application submitted
- **Reviewed** – HR is evaluating applications
- **Referred** – Your application was sent to the hiring manager
- **Selected** – You got the job
- **Not Referred** – You didn't make the cut

**"Referred" is the key milestone.** It means your resume made it past HR screening and is now with the hiring manager.

### What "Not Referred" Really Means

Don't take it personally. It usually means:
- Your resume didn't clearly show required qualifications
- Someone with higher veteran preference was selected
- The position was filled through another hiring authority
- You didn't claim all applicable eligibilities

### Following Up

Federal hiring managers are allowed to contact applicants who've been referred. You can also reach out:
- Find the hiring manager's contact info in the announcement
- Send a professional email expressing continued interest
- Ask about timeline and next steps
- Don't be pushy, but one follow-up is acceptable

## Common USAJOBS Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using a Civilian-Style Resume
- Federal resumes need more detail, not less
- Include hours, supervisor info, and salary
- 3-6 pages is normal

### Mistake 2: Not Claiming All Eligibilities
- Every eligibility is another pathway to hiring
- VRA, 30% disabled, and VEOA are powerful tools
- Don't assume HR will figure it out

### Mistake 3: Being Too Modest on Questionnaires
- Rate yourself at the highest supportable level
- If you can do it, claim it
- But ensure your resume backs up every claim

### Mistake 4: Applying to Jobs You're Not Qualified For
- Read the specialized experience requirements carefully
- If you don't have 1 year of experience at the next lower grade level, you won't qualify
- Focus on positions where you're competitive

### Mistake 5: Giving Up Too Soon
- Federal hiring takes months
- The first 10 applications might all go nowhere
- Keep applying, keep refining your resume
