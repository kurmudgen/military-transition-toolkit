# Onboarding Veterans: HR Playbook
## Best Practices for Successful Veteran Employee Integration

---

## Introduction

86% of new hires decide how long they'll stay with a company within their first 6 months—before retention issues become visible. For veterans transitioning from military to civilian careers, onboarding is even more critical.

**This playbook provides:**
- Veteran-specific onboarding best practices
- Cultural integration strategies
- First 90-day success frameworks
- Common challenges and solutions
- Mentor program guidance

---

## Understanding the Veteran Transition Challenge

**What Veterans Experience:**
- Complete career change (even similar roles have different culture)
- Loss of military identity and community
- New communication styles and workplace norms
- Ambiguity vs. military structure and clarity
- Need to prove themselves in unfamiliar environment

**Statistics:**
- 43% of veterans leave first civilian job within one year
- 69% of employees more likely to stay 3+ years with great onboarding
- 44% of veterans report difficulty adjusting to civilian workplace culture

**Your Goal:** Bridge military-to-civilian gap through structured, supportive onboarding.

## Common Onboarding Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Treating Them Like Any Other New Hire**
→ Veterans need cultural translation that others don't

**❌ Assuming They'll Figure It Out**
→ Military structure doesn't prepare for corporate ambiguity

**❌ Overwhelming with Jargon**
→ Translate corporate speak; don't assume understanding

**❌ No Veteran Community Connection**
→ Isolation is major retention risk factor

**❌ Vague Expectations**
→ Veterans excel with clear objectives; struggle with ambiguity

**❌ Infrequent Check-Ins**
→ Weekly 1:1s critical first 90 days; don't skip

**❌ No Cultural Coaching**
→ Workplace norms aren't intuitive for military backgrounds

**❌ Generic Onboarding**
→ One-size-fits-all doesn't address veteran-specific needs

## Manager Talking Points

**Day 1:**
"Welcome! I'm excited to have you on the team. I know transitioning from military to corporate can be challenging. My goal is to set you up for success. Please ask questions—there are no stupid questions. If something is unclear or unfamiliar, tell me. I'd rather over-communicate than assume you know something. How are you feeling about starting today?"

**Week 1:**
"How's the first week going? I know there's a lot of new information. What's been most confusing or surprising so far? Is there anything about how we work here that doesn't make sense? Remember, corporate culture is very different from military—I don't expect you to know all the unwritten rules yet."

**Month 1:**
"Let's talk about your first month. What's going well? What's been challenging? How comfortable do you feel with your role and responsibilities? Do you understand how performance is measured and what success looks like? Are you building relationships with the team? What support do you need from me?"

**Month 3:**
"You've been here 90 days. Let's review your accomplishments—you've done [specific achievements]. Here's where I see you growing next. Let's talk about your career goals. What do you want to achieve here in the next year? How can I support your development?"
