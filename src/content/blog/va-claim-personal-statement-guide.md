# VA Personal Statement: How to Write a Compelling Statement in Support of Claim

## Bottom Line Up Front

Your **personal statement** (Statement in Support of Claim) is your chance to explain your condition in your own words. Medical records show diagnoses; personal statements show **impact**. A well-written statement explains what happened in service, how your condition affects your daily life, and why service connection exists. **This is free, powerful evidence you control.** Every claim should include a detailed personal statement.

## What Is a Personal Statement?

A personal statement is a written document you submit with your VA claim that:
- Describes your condition from your perspective
- Explains the in-service event that caused or aggravated it
- Details how the condition affects your daily life
- Establishes continuity of symptoms since service
- Supports service connection

The VA form is **VA Form 21-4138** (Statement in Support of Claim), but you can also submit a typed letter.

**Why it matters:** Medical records often lack context. Your personal statement provides the narrative that ties everything together.

## What to Include in Your Personal Statement

### 1. Identification

Start with:
- Your full name
- Your VA file number or SSN (last 4)
- The condition(s) you're claiming

### 2. Military Service Summary

Briefly describe:
- Branch and dates of service
- MOS/rating
- Duty stations and deployments
- Relevant aspects of your service

### 3. In-Service Event or Cause

This is critical for service connection. Describe:
- What happened (injury, exposure, incident)
- When it happened (dates or approximate timeframe)
- Where it happened
- Who was involved
- How it affected you at the time
- Any treatment you received (or why you didn't seek treatment)

### 4. Symptoms During Service

Describe what you experienced:
- What symptoms did you have?
- How often?
- How did they affect your duties?
- Did you report them? Why or why not?

### 5. Symptoms After Service

Establish continuity:
- When did symptoms continue or resurface?
- How have they progressed?
- What treatment have you sought?

### 6. Current Symptoms

Describe in detail:
- What symptoms you experience now
- Frequency and severity
- What triggers them
- What makes them worse or better

### 7. Functional Impact

This is where you connect symptoms to daily life:
- Work impact (jobs lost, modifications needed, performance issues)
- Home life impact (what you can't do, assistance needed)
- Social impact (relationships, activities given up)
- Physical limitations (mobility, strength, endurance)

### 8. Flare-Ups (if applicable)

For conditions with flare-ups:
- How often do flare-ups occur?
- What causes them?
- How severe are they?
- How long do they last?
- What additional limitations occur during flare-ups?

### 9. Treatment History

Summarize:
- What treatments you've received
- What medications you've taken
- What's worked and what hasn't

### 10. Secondary Connection (if applicable)

If claiming secondary conditions:
- What is your primary service-connected condition?
- How did it cause or aggravate the secondary condition?
- What evidence supports this connection?

## Personal Statement Examples

### Example 1: Physical Injury (Back Pain)

---

**Statement in Support of Claim**

**Veteran:** John Smith
**VA File Number:** XXX-XX-1234
**Condition Claimed:** Lumbar spine condition (lower back pain)

**Military Service:**

I served in the United States Army from January 2008 to January 2016. My MOS was 11B (Infantryman). I completed two deployments to Afghanistan (2010 and 2013) and was stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.

**In-Service Incident:**

On approximately March 15, 2011, during a training exercise at Fort Bragg, I injured my lower back. We were conducting a road march with full combat loads (approximately 80 lbs). During a break, I sat down on uneven terrain and twisted awkwardly while reaching for my canteen. I felt immediate sharp pain in my lower back and had difficulty standing.

I reported to sick call the following day and was given Motrin and told to rest. The pain persisted, and I returned to sick call two more times over the following month. I was placed on limited duty for approximately two weeks.

I did not receive further medical care because I was preparing for deployment and did not want to be removed from my unit. I continued to experience back pain throughout my remaining service, managing it with over-the-counter medication.

**Symptoms During Service:**

From March 2011 until my separation in January 2016, I experienced:
- Constant dull aching pain in my lower back
- Sharp pain with bending, twisting, or lifting
- Difficulty carrying full combat loads
- Pain after prolonged sitting or standing
- Morning stiffness lasting 30+ minutes

I did not consistently document these issues because I wanted to remain with my unit and complete my service obligations. However, my squad mates witnessed my ongoing back problems and can provide statements.

**Current Symptoms:**

My back condition has worsened since separation. I currently experience:
- Constant pain rated 5-6/10 on a daily basis
- Sharp, stabbing pain rated 8-9/10 during flare-ups
- Radiating pain down my left leg (diagnosed as radiculopathy)
- Morning stiffness lasting 45-60 minutes
- Inability to bend forward past approximately 60 degrees due to pain
- Inability to lift more than 15 pounds without severe pain

**Flare-Ups:**

I experience flare-ups approximately 3-4 times per week. Flare-ups are triggered by:
- Prolonged sitting (more than 30 minutes)
- Bending or twisting
- Weather changes
- Physical activity

During flare-ups, my pain increases to 8-9/10, and I estimate I lose an additional 20-30 degrees of forward bending ability. Flare-ups typically last 1-2 days.

**Impact on Daily Life:**

My back condition significantly limits my daily activities:

**Work:** I was unable to continue working in construction after separation due to physical requirements. I had to retrain for office work, but even sitting at a desk causes pain. I have missed work approximately 2-3 days per month due to back pain.

**Home:** I cannot do yard work, carry groceries, or help with household tasks that require bending or lifting. My wife has taken over most physical household duties.

**Activities:** I can no longer play sports, exercise, or engage in physical hobbies I enjoyed before my injury. I have given up hunting, fishing from boats, and playing basketball.

**Treatment History:**

Since separation, I have:
- Received treatment at the VA for chronic back pain (2016-present)
- Completed two rounds of physical therapy
- Received epidural steroid injections (3 times)
- Been prescribed tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, and meloxicam
- Been referred to a spine specialist who recommended surgery

**Conclusion:**

My lower back condition is directly related to the injury I sustained during military service in March 2011. The condition has been continuous since that incident and has progressively worsened. I respectfully request service connection for my lumbar spine condition and associated radiculopathy.

I certify that the statements above are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

### Example 2: Mental Health (PTSD)

---

**Statement in Support of Claim**

**Veteran:** Jane Doe
**VA File Number:** XXX-XX-5678
**Condition Claimed:** Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

**Military Service:**

I served in the United States Marine Corps from June 2009 to June 2017. My MOS was 0311 (Rifleman). I completed three deployments to Afghanistan: Helmand Province in 2010, Sangin District in 2012, and Kabul in 2015.

**In-Service Stressors:**

During my deployment to Sangin District in 2012, I experienced multiple traumatic events:

**Primary stressor:** On July 23, 2012, our patrol was ambushed approximately 3 kilometers outside our FOB. We took heavy small arms and RPG fire for approximately 45 minutes. During the engagement, I witnessed two Marines from my squad killed—Lance Corporal [Name] and PFC [Name]. I helped carry LCpl [Name]'s body to the MEDEVAC helicopter. I believed I would die during this engagement.

**Additional stressors:**
- Multiple IED explosions near my position
- Handling remains of deceased service members on three occasions
- Being present during indirect fire attacks on our FOB (estimated 15+ times)
- Witnessing civilian casualties during combat operations

**Symptoms During Service:**

Following the July 2012 ambush, I began experiencing:
- Nightmares about the incident 3-4 times per week
- Difficulty sleeping
- Hypervigilance and constant alertness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Anger and irritability
- Emotional numbness

I did not seek mental health treatment during service because I feared being removed from my unit and viewed as weak. I completed my remaining enlistment by suppressing my symptoms.

**Current Symptoms:**

My PTSD symptoms have continued and worsened since separation. I currently experience:

**Re-experiencing:**
- Nightmares about combat 4-5 nights per week
- Flashbacks triggered by loud noises, helicopters, and crowded places
- Intrusive memories daily
- Severe distress when reminded of trauma

**Avoidance:**
- I avoid crowds, fireworks, and any situation that might trigger memories
- I don't discuss my service with anyone except my therapist
- I avoid news about Afghanistan and military topics

**Negative mood:**
- Persistent guilt about surviving when others died
- Emotional numbness
- Inability to feel positive emotions
- Detachment from family and friends

**Hyperarousal:**
- Severe insomnia (sleep 2-4 hours per night)
- Exaggerated startle response
- Hypervigilance (constantly scanning for threats)
- Anger outbursts

**Impact on Daily Life:**

**Employment:** I have been unable to maintain steady employment since separation. I have quit or been terminated from four jobs due to anger issues, inability to work around others, and panic attacks. I am currently unemployed and unable to work.

**Relationships:** My marriage ended in 2019. My ex-wife cited my PTSD symptoms—specifically anger, emotional distance, and nightmares—as primary reasons. I am currently estranged from most family members.

**Social:** I do not socialize. I have no close friends. I spend most days alone in my apartment. I cannot go to public places without severe anxiety.

**Suicide:** I have had suicidal thoughts on multiple occasions. I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation in November 2020.

**Treatment:**

I have been receiving mental health treatment at the VA since 2018:
- Weekly therapy with VA psychologist
- Prescribed medications: sertraline 150mg, prazosin 5mg, trazodone 100mg
- Previous medications tried: paroxetine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine (discontinued due to side effects or ineffectiveness)
- Participated in CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy) program

Despite treatment, my symptoms remain severe and significantly impact my ability to function.

**Conclusion:**

My PTSD is directly caused by combat trauma I experienced during my service in Afghanistan, specifically the events of July 23, 2012, and related combat exposures. My symptoms have been continuous since service and have significantly impaired my occupational and social functioning.

I certify that the statements above are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

### Example 3: Secondary Condition

---

**Statement in Support of Claim**

**Veteran:** Michael Johnson
**VA File Number:** XXX-XX-9012
**Condition Claimed:** Sleep Apnea (secondary to service-connected PTSD)

**Service-Connected Condition:**

I am currently service-connected for PTSD at 70%.

**Secondary Condition:**

I am claiming service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to my service-connected PTSD.

**Connection Between Conditions:**

My sleep apnea is caused and aggravated by my PTSD:

1. **PTSD sleep disturbance:** My PTSD causes severe sleep disturbance, including nightmares, hypervigilance that prevents relaxation, and frequent awakenings. This disrupted sleep pattern contributes to and worsens my sleep apnea.

2. **Research support:** Medical literature has established a strong correlation between PTSD and sleep apnea. Studies show veterans with PTSD have significantly higher rates of OSA than the general population.

3. **Weight gain:** My PTSD medications (particularly the antidepressants I've been prescribed) have contributed to weight gain. I gained approximately 40 pounds since starting psychiatric medications in 2018. This weight gain is a direct cause of my sleep apnea.

**Diagnosis:**

I was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea on February 15, 2024, following a sleep study at the VA Medical Center. My AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) was 22 events per hour.

**Current Treatment:**

I was prescribed a CPAP machine and have been using it nightly since March 2024.

**Impact:**

My sleep apnea, combined with my PTSD, creates a cycle that worsens both conditions. I experience:
- Severe daytime fatigue
- Difficulty concentrating
- Morning headaches
- Worsened PTSD symptoms due to sleep deprivation

**Conclusion:**

My sleep apnea is secondary to my service-connected PTSD. The sleep disturbance from PTSD, the weight gain from PTSD medications, and the established medical connection between PTSD and sleep apnea support service connection.

I certify that the statements above are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

## Personal Statement Tips

### Be Specific

Vague statements don't help. Include:
- Dates (or approximate dates)
- Locations
- Names of people involved
- Specific symptoms with frequency and severity

### Be Honest

Don't exaggerate. Describe your condition accurately, including your worst days.

### Be Complete

Cover all aspects:
- In-service event
- Symptoms during service
- Continuity since service
- Current symptoms
- Functional impact

### Be Organized

Use clear sections. Make it easy for the rater to find information.

### Address Gaps

If there are gaps in your medical records, explain them:
- "I did not seek treatment because..."
- "My records from this period were lost when..."

### Connect the Dots

Don't assume the rater will make connections. Explicitly state:
- How your service caused your condition
- How symptoms have continued
- How condition affects your daily life

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too brief:** One paragraph doesn't provide enough detail
2. **No functional impact:** Symptoms alone don't show disability
3. **Vague timeline:** Missing dates weakens credibility
4. **No in-service event:** Failing to establish what happened
5. **Exaggeration:** Undermines credibility if inconsistent with records

## The Bottom Line

Your personal statement is your voice in the claims process. Medical records provide data; your statement provides context and impact.

Take time to write a detailed, honest, organized statement that tells your complete story. It's free evidence that can significantly strengthen your claim.
