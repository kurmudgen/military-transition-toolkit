## Retention Framework

### Why Retention Matters More Than Acquisition

**Math**:
- Acquiring 1,000 users with 50% Month-2 retention = 500 users
- Acquiring 500 users with 80% Month-2 retention = 400 users

**After 12 months**:
- Scenario 1 (50% retention): 1,000 → 500 → 250 → 125 → 63 = **6% retained**
- Scenario 2 (80% retention): 500 → 400 → 320 → 256 → 205 = **41% retained**

**Revenue Impact**:
- Scenario 1: 63 users × $7 = $441 MRR
- Scenario 2: 205 users × $7 = $1,435 MRR

**Retention is 3.25x more valuable than acquisition in this example.**

                    └─────┬────┘

                    │  Power     │ (Use daily, all features)
                    │   Users    │
                    └─────┬─────┘
              ┌───────────┴────────────┐
              │   Active Users          │ (Weekly usage, core features)

    └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Goal**: Move users up the pyramid

**Metrics**:
- **New Users**: Just signed up (Day 0)
- **Engaged Users**: 3+ sessions, used 2+ features (Day 1-7)
- **Active Users**: Weekly usage, core feature adoption (Week 2-4)
- **Power Users**: Daily/multi-weekly usage, all features (Month 2+)
- **Advocates**: Refer friends, create testimonials, participate in community (Month 3+)

---

## Onboarding Optimization

### The First Mile Problem

**Stat**: 40-60% of users who sign up never come back.

**Why**: Poor onboarding. Users don't understand value or how to get it.

**Solution**: Systematic onboarding that drives to "aha moment" quickly.

```
Subject: Your military resume is probably wrong (here's how to fix it)

[Name],

I've reviewed 1,000+ veteran resumes. Here are the top 3 mistakes:

❌ Using military jargon civilians don't understand
❌ Focusing on duties instead of accomplishments
❌ Not quantifying impact (numbers matter!)

Good news: MTT's Resume Builder fixes all of this automatically.

Here's how it works:

1. Enter your MOS and key responsibilities
2. Our translator converts military terms to civilian language
3. We suggest accomplishment statements with quantified impact
4. Download polished resume (ATS-optimized)

#### Week 3: Salary Calculator Campaign
**Email**:
```
Subject: Are you aiming too low? (salary reality check)

Example:
- E-5 with 6 years: $45K military pay
- Common first offer: $50K civilian (+11%)
- Actual market value: $65K-$75K (+44-66%)

Don't leave $20K on the table.

- Interview dates
- Offer comparisons

MTT's Job Search Tracker organizes everything:

✓ Application dashboard (see all jobs at a glance)
✓ Follow-up reminders (never miss a touchpoint)

### Cohort Analysis

| Cohort | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Jan 2025 | 100 | 85 (85%) | 75 (75%) | 65 (65%) | 55 (55%) |
| Feb 2025 | 150 | 135 (90%) | 120 (80%) | - | - |
| Mar 2025 | 200 | 180 (90%) | - | - | - |

### Feature Adoption vs Retention

**Hypothesis**: Users who adopt more features have higher retention

**Test**:

| Features Adopted | Month 2 Retention | Month 6 Retention |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0-1 | 30% | 10% |
| 2-3 | 50% | 30% |
| 4-5 | 75% | 55% |
| 6+ (Power Users) | 90% | 80% |

**Conclusion**: Drive feature adoption early to maximize retention

**Action**: Focus onboarding on getting users to adopt 4-5 core features in first 7 days

## Conclusion: Retention = Revenue

Retention is the engine of sustainable growth.

**The Math**:
- 100 new users/month
- 80% Month 2 retention
- 70% Month 6 retention
- 60% Month 12 retention

**After 12 months**:
- Month 1: 100 users
- Month 2: 100 + 80 = 180 users
- Month 3: 180 + 80 + 70 = 330 users
- Month 6: 630 users
- Month 12: 900 users

**Revenue**: 900 × $7 = $6,300 MRR

**vs 50% retention**:
- Month 12: 450 users = $3,150 MRR (50% less revenue!)

**Focus on retention. It's the difference between success and failure.**
