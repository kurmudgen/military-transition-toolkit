## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge #1: "I Don't Have APICS Certification"

**Reality:** Not required to get hired, but valuable for advancement.

**Solution:**
- Get first supply chain job without cert
- Employer often pays for cert after hire
- Or get cert before applying (competitive advantage)

### Challenge #2: "My Supply Experience Isn't Recognized"

**Reality:** Civilian employers don't always understand military supply scale.

**Solution:**
- Translate military supply to civilian terms
- "Managed inventory of 10,000+ SKUs" = explains complexity
- "Oversaw $50M annual budget" = shows scale
- "Negotiated contracts with 30+ vendors" = shows experience

### Challenge #3: "Supply Chain Seems Boring"

**Reality:** It can be. But it's also strategic and impactful.

**Why interesting:** Supply chain directly impacts company profitability. It's a high-impact role.

**If truly not interested:** Consider other roles (procurement, operations management, project management).
