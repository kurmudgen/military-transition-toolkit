## 7. INTERVIEW PREPARATION

**Common Question: "Tell me about your supply experience."**

**Good Answer:**
"I was a Supply Specialist in the Army, which means I managed the entire supply chain for a 500-person organization. This included procurement—ordering $2M+ in equipment annually—inventory management of $15M in assets, warehouse operations, and distribution. I used GCSS-Army, which is the Army's version of SAP, to track inventory, process orders, and manage supply transactions. One achievement I'm proud of is maintaining 98% inventory accuracy, which exceeded the Army standard. I also reduced costs by 15% through strategic vendor management. I'm confident these skills translate directly to this supply chain coordinator role."

---

**Common Question: "What experience do you have with inventory management systems?"**

**Good Answer:**
"In the Army, I used GCSS-Army, which is a military ERP system built on SAP. I processed hundreds of supply transactions monthly—requisitions, receipts, issues, transfers. I also conducted cycle counts and physical inventories quarterly to maintain accuracy. While I haven't used [specific civilian system], ERP systems share the same core functionality, and I'm confident I can learn your system quickly.
