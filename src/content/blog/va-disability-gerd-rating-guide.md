# VA Disability Rating for GERD/Acid Reflux: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 7346** (hiatal hernia) with ratings of **10%, 30%, or 60%**. Most veterans receive **10-30%**. GERD is commonly claimed as **secondary** to PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, medications, or chronic pain conditions. The key is documenting **symptom frequency** (heartburn, regurgitation), **failed treatments**, and **impact on nutrition/health**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is GERD and How Does Military Service Cause It?

GERD occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms.

**Symptoms:**
- Heartburn (burning sensation in chest)
- Regurgitation of food or sour liquid
- Difficulty swallowing
- Chest pain
- Sensation of lump in throat
- Chronic cough
- Laryngitis
- Disrupted sleep

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- First onset during service
- Stress-related during deployments
- Dietary factors during field operations
- Irregular eating schedules
- Service-related hiatal hernia

**Secondary service connection (common):**
- **PTSD/anxiety/depression**: Stress increases acid production
- **Medications**: NSAIDs for pain conditions, psychiatric medications
- **Sleep apnea**: Air pressure affects LES
- **Obesity**: From service-connected conditions limiting exercise
- **Back conditions**: Posture affects digestion

## VA Rating Criteria

GERD is rated under **38 CFR § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346** (hiatal hernia):

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Two or more of: persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health |
| **30%** | Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health |
| **60%** | Symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health |

### Key Terms

- **Pyrosis**: Heartburn
- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing
- **Regurgitation**: Food/acid coming back up
- **Hematemesis**: Vomiting blood
- **Melena**: Black, tarry stools (blood in GI tract)

### Rating Factors

- **Symptom combinations**: Multiple symptoms support higher ratings
- **Health impairment**: Weight loss, anemia, malnutrition
- **Treatment failure**: Ongoing symptoms despite treatment

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing GI complaints
- Documentation of stress, diet issues during service
- Evidence supporting secondary connection

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Gastroenterology evaluation
- Upper endoscopy (EGD) results
- pH monitoring results
- Barium swallow study

### Severity Evidence
- Frequency of symptoms
- Medications taken (PPIs, H2 blockers)
- Treatment records
- Weight loss documentation
- Complications (Barrett's esophagus, strictures)

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Ask about symptoms and frequency
3. Review medications
4. Assess impact on health/nutrition
5. Review test results

**What to tell them:**
- How often you have heartburn/regurgitation
- All symptoms (chest pain, swallowing issues)
- Medications and their effectiveness
- Weight changes
- Impact on sleep and quality of life

## Secondary Conditions

**GERD commonly secondary to:**
- PTSD/anxiety/depression
- Medications for service-connected conditions
- Sleep apnea
- Obesity

**GERD can cause:**
- Esophageal stricture
- Barrett's esophagus
- Chronic cough
- Sleep disturbance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim GERD secondary to PTSD?
Yes. Stress and anxiety increase stomach acid production. This is a well-recognized connection.

### What if my GERD is controlled by medication?
You can still receive a rating. Document that you require medication for control and describe any breakthrough symptoms.

### Does GERD have to show on testing?
While objective findings (endoscopy, pH study) help, GERD is largely diagnosed based on symptoms. Document your symptoms thoroughly.
