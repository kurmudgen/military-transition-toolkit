# Consulting Business for Military Spouses: Building Expertise-Based Income

## Bottom Line Up Front

Consulting allows military spouses to monetize professional expertise at **$75-$300+/hour**—rates that make location challenges irrelevant. If you have specialized knowledge from past careers, education, or unique experience (including military spouse life itself), consulting offers **$50,000-$200,000+ annual income** working entirely remotely. Startup costs are minimal ($0-$500), clients pay for your brain not your location, and your expertise travels with you. The barrier is identifying and packaging what you know.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Consulting converts your knowledge into location-independent income:

**Traditional Employment:**
- Trade hours for wages
- Employer decides your value
- Limited by local opportunities
- Resume gaps penalized
- Restart with each PCS

**Consulting Model:**
- Trade expertise for premium rates
- You set your value
- Clients can be anywhere
- Results matter more than history
- Business moves with you

**The Key Insight:** What's ordinary knowledge to you is valuable expertise to others. Your career experience, industry knowledge, or specialized skills are worth money to people who lack them.

## PCS-Proofing Your Consulting Practice

### Advantages of Consulting During PCS

Unlike photography or real estate, consulting is fully portable:
- Clients don't care where you are
- Virtual meetings standard
- No local permits or licensing
- Relationships travel with you

### PCS Considerations

**Before PCS:**
- Complete active projects (or plan handoff)
- Communicate timeline to clients
- Schedule "light" weeks during move

**During PCS:**
- Maintain client communication (brief check-ins)
- Honor commitments made
- Accept temporary reduced capacity

**After PCS:**
- Resume normal operations within days
- No marketing restart needed
- Clients unaffected

### OCONUS Consulting

**Works Excellently:**
- US-based clients don't care about your location
- Time zone differences manageable
- May actually prefer early morning or evening calls
- Internet is the only requirement

**Considerations:**
- Reliable internet essential
- Plan call times around time zones
- Some payment processors have international limitations
- Consider retainer model for time zone flexibility

## Success Stories

**Jennifer, Navy Spouse - HR Consultant**
"I was an HR manager who couldn't find equivalent work at our rural duty station. I started consulting for small businesses who needed HR help but couldn't afford full-time staff. First client paid $75/hour. Now I charge $175/hour and have 6 retainer clients. When we PCS'd to Japan, not a single client cared. I just shifted my call times to evenings."

**David, Army Spouse - Marketing Strategy**
"After years in marketing leadership, I kept taking entry-level jobs at each duty station. At 40, I said enough. Started marketing consulting at $125/hour. Focused on healthcare practices—my wife's military medical background gave me insights. Year one was $65K. Year three is $140K. I'll never apply for a job again."

**Aisha, Air Force Spouse - Nonprofit Consultant**
"My background was nonprofit management, which doesn't exist in most duty station towns. Now I consult with nonprofits nationwide on operations, governance, and fundraising. Most clients I've never met in person. I charge $150/hour for advisory and $8,000 for board training workshops. Made $95K last year working 30 hours a week."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "I don't have enough expertise"
**Reality:** You likely undervalue what you know. Knowledge that seems basic to you is valuable to those who lack it. Start with what you know well, even if it feels ordinary. Your unique perspective (including military spouse experience) adds value.

### "No one will pay my rates"
**Solution:** Someone is paying those rates somewhere—consultants in every niche charge $100+/hour. Start with what feels comfortable, then raise with each engagement. Value-based pricing (focus on results) helps justify rates.

### "I don't know how to find clients"
**Solution:** Your network is larger than you think. Former colleagues, professional connections, and referrals are the primary sources for most consultants. LinkedIn makes it easy to reconnect. Start there before cold outreach.

### "What about benefits and stability?"
**Solution:** You have TRICARE—the biggest benefit concern is solved. Stability comes from multiple clients (never depend on one). Retainer clients provide predictable income. Many consultants feel more stable than employees because they control their income.

### "I don't have a corporate background"
**Solution:** Consulting isn't limited to corporate. Nonprofits, small businesses, government contractors, educational institutions, and healthcare organizations all use consultants. Your experience in any professional setting translates.
