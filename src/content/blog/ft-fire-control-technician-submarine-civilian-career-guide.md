## Bottom Line Up Front

Navy FTs (Fire Control Technicians - Submarine) get stereotyped as "too specialized to translate." That's dead wrong. You've got **advanced electronics troubleshooting, combat systems expertise, security clearances, precision under pressure, and submarine-level attention to detail**—skills that translate directly to defense contracting, electronics engineering, radar systems, and industrial automation. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$55,000-$75,000**, with experienced professionals hitting **$85,000-$147,000+** in defense contracting, weapons systems engineering, or cleared technical roles. You'll need some certs and maybe an associate's degree, but your submarine experience and clearance are worth serious money.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every FT who starts researching civilian careers hears the same thing: "Submarine work is too specialized." "Civilians don't need fire control systems." "You'll have to completely retrain."

Here's what that misses: **you didn't just push buttons on a weapons console.**

You:
- Operated and maintained $50+ million combat control systems
- Troubleshot advanced electronics and integrated computer networks
- Maintained submarine weapon systems with zero margin for error
- Held security clearances (Secret or TS/SCI)
- Worked in high-pressure environments with extreme accountability
- Documented technical procedures to exacting standards
- Diagnosed complex electrical and electronic faults
- Stood watch in mission-critical submarine operations

That's systems integration, electronics expertise, troubleshooting under pressure, security clearance value, and unmatched reliability. Those skills have serious value in the civilian world. You just need to translate them into language civilians understand and target industries that actually need them.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "Fire Control Technician" on your resume. Civilians don't know what that means. Here's how to translate:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Fire Control Technician (FT) | Electronics Systems Technician / Combat Systems Specialist |
| Operated submarine combat control systems | Operated and maintained advanced integrated electronics and computer systems |
| Maintained weapons systems | Performed preventive and corrective maintenance on mission-critical equipment valued at $50M+ |
| Troubleshot fire control electronics | Diagnosed and repaired complex electrical, electronic, and computer network faults |
| Submarine qualified | Worked in high-consequence environment requiring extreme attention to detail and reliability |
| Secret/TS clearance | Hold active DoD security clearance (specify level) |
| Technical documentation | Created and maintained detailed technical records and maintenance logs |
| Combat systems watchstander | Operated critical systems in 24/7 operations with zero-failure tolerance |
| System integration and testing | Performed acceptance testing, integration verification, and troubleshooting of multi-system platforms |

Use **active verbs**: Operated, Maintained, Diagnosed, Repaired, Troubleshot, Integrated, Tested, Documented.

Use **numbers**: "Maintained $50M+ combat systems," "Diagnosed 95% of electronic faults within 2 hours," "Performed 200+ system tests."

Drop the acronyms unless they're industry-standard (like SCADA, PLC, or LAN). No civilian knows what CCS, SWFTS, or OTH means. Spell it out: "Combat Control System," "Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System."

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill benefits:

**Project Management Professional (PMP)** - If pivoting to program management. Requires 3 years experience. Cost: $500-$3,000 for training + exam. Value: Senior roles in defense/engineering ($90K-$120K+).

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest. There are civilian skills you don't have. Recognizing the gap is the first step.

**Business communication:** Submarines run on technical briefs and watchbills. Civilian jobs require email etiquette, professional presentations, and customer communication. Practice translating technical concepts for non-technical people.

**Commercial software and tools:** You know submarine-specific systems inside and out. Learn industry-standard tools: CAD software, Microsoft Project, MATLAB, or whatever's common in your target field. Take online courses.

**Customer service mindset:** Submarine culture is mission-focused and direct. Civilian technical roles (especially field service) require customer-facing soft skills. You'll need to adjust your communication style—less "fix it now" and more "let me understand your issue."

**Resume and interview skills:** Writing a civilian resume and interviewing is different. Translate your experience into civilian terms. Use the [Military Transition Toolkit](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com) to help convert your FT experience into language HR understands.

**Non-military work culture:** Civilian workplaces are less hierarchical and more collaborative. You won't have the same chain of command structure. Be ready to adapt to different management styles and work environments.

## Real FT success stories

- Negotiate offers (don't just accept the first number—your clearance and experience have value)

## Bottom line for FTs

Your submarine fire control experience isn't too specialized. It's highly specialized in exactly the areas that matter—electronics, troubleshooting, high-reliability systems, and working under pressure.

You've proven you can maintain mission-critical equipment worth millions of dollars with zero tolerance for failure. You've held security clearances. You've worked in one of the most demanding technical environments on Earth.

Those skills translate directly to defense contracting, electronics engineering, industrial automation, field service, and power systems. Thousands of submarine FTs have transitioned successfully before you. You're not starting from zero.

First-year income of $55K-$75K is realistic. With a clearance and some certifications, $80K-$95K is achievable immediately. Within 5 years, cleared technical professionals regularly hit $100K-$130K+.

Defense contractors actively want you. If you have TS/SCI, you're looking at six-figure offers right out of the gate.

Don't listen to people who say submarine experience doesn't translate. They don't understand what you actually did. Target the right industries, get a few key certifications, and translate your experience properly. You'll do fine.
