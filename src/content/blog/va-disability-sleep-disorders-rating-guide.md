# VA Disability Rating for Sleep Disorders (Other Than Apnea): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Sleep disorders other than sleep apnea are rated under various diagnostic codes depending on the specific condition. **Narcolepsy** is rated under **DC 8108** at **10-80%**. Many other sleep issues are rated as symptoms of underlying conditions (PTSD, depression, TBI) under mental health ratings. Sleep disturbances support higher ratings for mental health conditions when "chronic sleep impairment" is documented. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## Sleep Disorders and Their Rating Codes

### Narcolepsy (DC 8108)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Mild; rarely more than 1-2 attacks per day; no cataplexy |
| **20%** | Moderate; 1-5 attacks per day; mild cataplexy |
| **40%** | Moderately severe; more than 5 attacks per day; moderate cataplexy |
| **60%** | Severe; 10-15 attacks per day; severe cataplexy requiring drug treatment |
| **80%** | Profound; attacks more than 15 times per day; severe cataplexy; unable to perform routine daily activities |

### Other Sleep Disorders

**Insomnia, sleep disturbance, nightmares:** Usually rated as part of mental health conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety) under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. "Chronic sleep impairment" is specifically listed as supporting 30%.

**Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness):** May be rated under DC 8108 (narcolepsy) by analogy if significant daytime sleepiness affects function.

**REM Sleep Behavior Disorder:** Often associated with TBI or neurological conditions; rated under applicable code.

**Circadian Rhythm Disorders:** May be rated by analogy or as part of underlying condition.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is insomnia rated?
Insomnia is typically rated as part of mental health conditions (PTSD, depression). "Chronic sleep impairment" supports 30% under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

### Can I claim sleep problems separately from PTSD?
If your sleep issues are symptoms of PTSD, they're rated together. If you have a separate, distinct sleep disorder (like narcolepsy), it may be rated separately.

### Do I need a sleep study?
For conditions like narcolepsy, a sleep study with MSLT is important. For insomnia associated with mental health, clinical documentation may suffice.
