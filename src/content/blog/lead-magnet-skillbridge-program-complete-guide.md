## 1. WHAT IS SKILLBRIDGE AND WHY YOU NEED IT

**SkillBridge = Internship during your last 180 days of military service**

**The Program:**
- You work for a civilian company as an intern
- You remain on active duty (keep getting full military pay + benefits)
- The company trains you for a civilian career
- **60-80% of participants get hired by the company after separation**

**In other words:**
- FREE training and job experience
- PAID (by the military, not the company)
- Direct path to civilian employment

---

### **WHY SKILLBRIDGE IS THE #1 TRANSITION PROGRAM**

**Reason #1: You Get Paid While Learning**
- Full military salary (base pay + BAH + BAS)
- Full benefits (Tricare, commissary, etc.)
- Company doesn't pay you (so they're incentivized to hire veterans)

**Reason #2: 60-80% Hire Rate**
- Companies use SkillBridge as a "try before you buy" hiring program
- If you perform well, they'll hire you
- Much higher success rate than applying cold to jobs

**Reason #3: Hands-On Experience**
- You're actually working in the industry/company
- Learning real skills and tools
- Building your network inside the company

**Reason #4: Smooth Transition**
- You're still on active duty (no gap in pay/benefits)
- Transition to civilian job is seamless
- Reduces stress of finding employment after ETS

---

### **THE VALUE**

**What you get:**
- 3-6 months of corporate training (value: $10,000-$30,000)
- Inside track to employment (job offer upon completion)
- Professional network (connections at company)
- Updated resume (civilian work experience)
- Confidence in civilian workplace

**Cost to you:** $0

**Opportunity cost:** Your last 180 days of active duty (you'd be separating anyway)

**Bottom line:** SkillBridge is the single best transition program available to service members.

---

## 2. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

### **WHO CAN PARTICIPATE**

**Service Requirements:**
✅ Active duty members (all branches)
✅ Transitioning within 180 days of separation or retirement
✅ Honorable discharge (or general under honorable conditions)
✅ Approved by your command

**Who's eligible:**
- Enlisted (any rank)
- Officers (any rank)
- 20-year retirees
- Medical separations
- End of contract separations

**Who's NOT eligible:**
- National Guard/Reserves (on drill status—must be on active orders)
- Individuals with less than 180 days remaining
- Anyone without command approval

---

### **180-DAY RULE**

**You can start SkillBridge up to 180 days before your separation date.**

**Examples:**
- Separation date: December 31, 2024
- Earliest SkillBridge start: July 4, 2024 (180 days prior)

**Common durations:**
- 90 days (3 months) - Most common
- 120 days (4 months)
- 180 days (6 months) - Full duration, less common

**Note:** Your command must approve the specific length. Some commands only approve 90 days.

---

## 3. HOW SKILLBRIDGE WORKS

### **THE PROCESS (SIMPLIFIED)**

**Step 1:** Find a SkillBridge company/program (12+ months before separation)

**Step 2:** Apply to the company (like a job application)

**Step 3:** Interview with the company

**Step 4:** Get accepted by the company

**Step 5:** Get command approval (submit packet 6-9 months before start)

**Step 6:** Sign Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with company

**Step 7:** Out-process from your unit

**Step 8:** Start SkillBridge internship (remain on active duty)

**Step 9:** Complete program (3-6 months)

**Step 10:** Separate from military → Get hired by company (60-80% success rate)

---

### **WHAT YOU DO DURING SKILLBRIDGE**

**You work full-time at the company:**
- 40 hours/week
- Same schedule as civilian employees
- Doing real work (not busy work)
- Learning the company's systems, processes, culture

**Examples of SkillBridge roles:**
- Software development intern at Microsoft
- Cybersecurity analyst trainee at Deloitte
- Project coordinator at Amazon
- Logistics analyst at UPS
- Sales associate at Oracle
- Electrician apprentice at IBEW
- IT support at Google

**You're evaluated just like an employee:**
- Performance reviews
- Feedback from managers
- If you do well = job offer
- If you underperform = no job offer (but you still get paid by the military)

---

### **WHAT THE COMPANY GETS**

**Why companies participate:**

1. **Free labor** (military pays your salary, not them)
2. **Vetted talent** (service members are disciplined, trained, reliable)
3. **Veteran hiring goals** (many companies have veteran hiring quotas)
4. **"Try before you buy"** (evaluate you for 3-6 months before committing to hire)

**It's a win-win:**
- You get training and job opportunity
- Company gets free skilled worker and fulfills veteran hiring goals

2. **Company Offer Letter** (from SkillBridge company)
3. **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** (between DoD and company)

---

```

---

### **COMMON REASONS COMMANDS DENY SKILLBRIDGE**

**Mission requirements:**
- Unit is deploying or in critical training cycle
- Your position is critical and they can't replace you

**Solution:** Apply earlier so replacement can be trained. Offer to help train replacement before starting SkillBridge.

---

**Out-processing not complete:**
- Command requires you to finish all out-processing before releasing you

**Solution:** Start out-processing early. Complete medical, finance, legal, CIF turn-in, etc. before SkillBridge starts.

---

**Lack of understanding:**
- Command doesn't understand SkillBridge or thinks it's vacation

**Solution:** Educate leadership using official DoD SkillBridge resources (skillbridge.mil). Provide examples of other service members who successfully completed SkillBridge.

---

**Personal bias:**
- Some leaders believe SkillBridge is "shirking duty"

**Solution:** Frame SkillBridge as official transition program authorized by DoD. Emphasize it benefits the military (better veteran employment outcomes).

---

### **TIPS FOR GETTING APPROVED**

✅ **Start early** (submit packet 6-9 months before separation)
✅ **Communicate with leadership** (keep them informed)
✅ **Show how it benefits you AND the military**
✅ **Offer to train your replacement**
✅ **Complete out-processing early**
✅ **Be flexible on start date** (if command needs you an extra month, adjust SkillBridge start)
✅ **Get support from Transition Assistance Office** (they can advocate for you)

---

## 8. RESUME & APPLICATION TIPS FOR SKILLBRIDGE

**SkillBridge applications are competitive, especially at top companies.**

---

### **RESUME TIPS**

**1. Translate military experience to civilian language**

❌ Bad: "Squad Leader, 11B Infantry"
✅ Good: "Team Leader - Led 9-person team in high-stress operational environments"

**2. Focus on transferable skills**

Include:
- Leadership
- Project management
- Problem-solving
- Communication
- Technical skills

**3. Quantify achievements**

❌ Bad: "Managed equipment"
✅ Good: "Managed $5M in equipment with 100% accountability"

**4. Tailor to the company/role**

- Use keywords from the job description
- Highlight relevant experience for that specific role

---

### **APPLICATION TIPS**

**1. Apply to multiple companies (5-10)**

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Apply to a mix of competitive (Amazon, Microsoft) and less competitive (regional companies) programs.

**2. Write a strong cover letter**

Explain:
- Why you're transitioning
- Why you're interested in this company/industry
- What you bring from your military experience
- Your career goals

**3. Network**

Connect with veterans at the company on LinkedIn. Ask about their SkillBridge experience. Sometimes a referral can get your application noticed.

**4. Prepare for interviews**

Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to answer behavioral questions.

**5. Be persistent**

If you don't hear back, follow up politely after 2 weeks.

## 10. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**Mistake #1: Waiting too long to apply**

Many service members don't start looking until 3-4 months before separation. By then, good programs are full.

**Solution:** Start researching 12 months out, apply 9-10 months out.

---

**Mistake #2: Only applying to one company**

**Solution:** Apply to 5-10 companies. Competitive programs reject 80%+ of applicants.

---

**Mistake #3: Not getting command approval early**

**Solution:** Submit approval packet 6-9 months before separation. Approval can take 2-3 months.

---

**Mistake #4: Poor performance during SkillBridge**

Some service members treat SkillBridge like vacation. **This is your job audition.**

**Solution:** Show up on time, work hard, ask questions, network. Treat it like the first 90 days of a job (because it is).

---

**Mistake #5: Not networking during SkillBridge**

**Solution:** Build relationships with coworkers, managers, and HR. They're your advocates for getting hired.
