## Bottom Line Up Front

92W Water Treatment Specialists transitioning out—you're entering one of America's most critical and stable industries: water and wastewater utilities. Your **water purification and treatment expertise, chemical handling and testing knowledge, equipment operations experience, water quality testing and monitoring, regulatory compliance understanding, preventive maintenance skills, and proven ability to deliver safe potable water** make you valuable to municipal water utilities, industrial water treatment, wastewater facilities, and environmental consulting. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$47,000-$62,000** as water/wastewater plant operator or water quality technician, scaling to **$70,000-$90,000** as chief operator, plant supervisor, or water treatment manager with 5-8 years experience and advanced certifications. Senior water utility managers and directors earn **$90,000-$120,000+**. The water industry desperately needs skilled operators—10,700 openings projected annually—and your military training provides a significant head start.

Every 92W separating faces the same challenge: explaining what "water treatment specialist" means to civilian employers. They don't know you operated reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPU), 3,000 and 600 GPH systems producing thousands of gallons daily, conducted water quality testing (pH, chlorine residual, turbidity, TDS), handled treatment chemicals safely, maintained complex mechanical and filtration equipment, and ensured troops had safe drinking water in environments from desert heat to arctic cold—where contaminated water meant mission failure.

Here's what you actually did as a 92W:
- Operated water purification equipment producing 3,000-600 gallons per hour of potable water
- Conducted water quality testing using test kits and laboratory procedures (pH, chlorine, turbidity, bacteriological)
- Treated raw water sources (rivers, wells, lakes) removing contaminants to EPA drinking water standards
- Handled treatment chemicals (chlorine, coagulants, pH adjusters) following safety protocols
- Performed preventive maintenance on pumps, filters, membranes, and treatment systems
- Monitored water treatment processes adjusting chemical dosing and system parameters
- Maintained detailed water quality logs and regulatory documentation
- Operated in field environments setting up and operating mobile water purification systems

That's water plant operations, water quality analysis, chemical treatment processes, equipment maintenance, regulatory compliance, and environmental protection. Civilian water utilities, wastewater treatment facilities, industrial water treatment, and environmental services companies need experienced operators with exactly your background.

## What Does a 92W Water Treatment Specialist Do?

As a 92W, you ensured soldiers had safe drinking water—a mission-critical function preventing waterborne disease that historically killed more soldiers than combat. You were the subject matter expert on water purification, treatment, and distribution.

You operated ROWPU systems (3K and 600 GPH) processing raw water from questionable sources into safe potable water. You conducted water quality testing before, during, and after treatment. You managed water distribution points ensuring treated water remained uncontaminated. You handled and stored treatment chemicals (calcium hypochlorite, alum, polymers).

You performed operator-level maintenance: changing filters, cleaning membranes, replacing pumps, troubleshooting equipment failures. You worked in all environments—desert forward operating bases, jungle training, arctic exercises, humanitarian missions—adapting treatment to different raw water sources and conditions.

You understood EPA drinking water standards, waterborne contaminants, treatment processes (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, disinfection), and water distribution system protection.
