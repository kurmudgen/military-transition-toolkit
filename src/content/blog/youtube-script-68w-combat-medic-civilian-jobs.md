[INTRO - 15 seconds]

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
68W getting out? Here's your choice: $48K paramedic or $98K registered nurse. I'll show you both paths.

**Context (next 12 seconds):**
Combat medics have three clear options: direct transition to paramedic, accelerated nursing programs that cut years off your degree, or physician assistant school. I'm breaking down the real timelines, actual costs, which programs accept your military training for credit, and which path makes the most financial sense.

[MAIN CONTENT - 7-8 minutes]

**Section 1: Your Training Value Reality Check (60 seconds)**

Let's talk about what your 68W training is actually worth in the civilian world. You might not like this, but you need to hear it.

[Visual suggestion: Certification equivalency chart]

**What you have:**
- Emergency medical procedures training
- Trauma care experience most civilian EMTs will never see
- High-stress decision-making skills
- IV starts, airway management, patient assessment

**What civilians recognize:**
- EMT-Basic certification (from your NREMT during AIT)
- That's it

Here's the hard truth: You cannot directly challenge for paramedic certification. You must complete a full paramedic program. Your combat experience doesn't automatically translate to civilian credentials.

But here's the good news: you have a massive head start, and there are accelerated programs specifically for veterans that cut years off the normal timeline.

**Section 2: Path #1 - EMT/Paramedic (The Fast Track) (90 seconds)**

This is the quickest path to employment. If you need income immediately, this is it.

[Visual suggestion: Career progression timeline]

**Timeline & Salary:**

**EMT-Basic (you already have this): $35K-$45K/year**
- You got NREMT-B in AIT
- Just need state certification (varies by state)
- Can work immediately after separation
- Cost: $50-$200 for state cert

**Paramedic: $46K-$88K/year (average $48K)**
- Requires paramedic school (cannot challenge exam)
- 1,200-1,800 hours of training (12-24 months)
- Full program cost: $3,000-$15,000 (GI Bill covers this)
- Average salary: $48,150/year or $23/hour

**Best markets for paramedics:**
- Seattle area: $87,641/year
- San Francisco: $75,000+/year
- Washington DC: $65,000-$75,000/year
- New York City: $60,000-$70,000/year

**Veteran-friendly paramedic programs:**
- Lansing Community College (MI) - Military Medic to Paramedic bridge
- Central Texas College - Fast-track for 68W/corpsmen
- Pima Community College (AZ) - Veteran-focused program
- Most community colleges offer some veteran credit

**Use your GI Bill:** Paramedic programs are GI Bill approved. You get:
- Tuition covered
- Monthly housing allowance ($1,500-$2,500 depending on location)
- Book stipend

**Reality check:** Paramedic work is physically demanding, high-stress, and the pay doesn't match the responsibility level. Burnout rates are high. Most paramedics work 48-72 hour weeks, including nights, weekends, and holidays.

**This path makes sense if:**
- You love pre-hospital emergency medicine
- You want to work immediately
- You're okay with the salary ceiling
- You might use it as a stepping stone to flight paramedic ($60K-$80K) or fire department

**Section 3: Path #2 - Registered Nurse (The Money Move) (120 seconds)**

This is where smart 68Ws make real money. Pay attention to this section.

[Visual suggestion: Salary comparison chart RN vs Paramedic]

**Registered Nurse salary 2025:**
- National average: $94,480-$98,430/year ($45-$47/hour)
- Entry-level (0-1 year): $60,000-$70,000/year
- Experienced (10+ years): $100,000+/year
- Specialized roles (ICU, ER, OR): $85,000-$120,000/year

**Compare that to paramedic:** Same skills, same patients, double the salary.

**The traditional path (DON'T do this):**
- 4-year BSN program
- $40,000-$100,000 in costs
- Same timeline as everyone else
- You're wasting your military experience

**The smart path - Accelerated programs for veterans:**

[Visual suggestion: List of accelerated programs]

**1. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center - Veteran to BSN**
- 12 months to BSN (yes, one year)
- 61 semester credit hours
- Accepts military medical training for credit
- GI Bill approved
- Location: Lubbock, TX

**2. University of South Florida - V-CARE Pathway**
- Specifically for military medics and corpsmen
- Accelerated BSN
- Support services for veteran students
- Tampa, FL (excellent job market)

**3. George Washington University - BSN Veterans Option**
- 4 consecutive semesters (16 months)
- Full-time program
- Ashburn, VA campus
- Near DC (highest-paying RN market on East Coast)

**4. Florida International University**
- 4 semesters or less
- Miami area (high demand for bilingual nurses)
- Military credit transfers

**5. Wayne State University - BSN for Veterans**
- Detroit area
- Accelerated pathway
- Strong veteran support services

**6. Herzing University - Military Medic to RN (Online + Campus)**
- ASN or BSN options
- Online + clinical rotations
- Multiple start dates
- Flexible for working veterans

**Cost:** Most programs $30K-$60K total. GI Bill covers 100% tuition + housing allowance.

**Timeline:** 12-24 months for BSN

**Your actual cost:** $0 if using GI Bill, plus you get $2,000-$3,000/month housing allowance while in school.

**ROI calculation:**
- Paramedic: 18 months school, $48K starting salary
- RN: 18 months school, $70K starting salary
- Difference: $22K/year MORE as RN
- Over 30-year career: $660,000+ additional earnings (before overtime and raises)

**Plus RN benefits:**
- Better schedules (3x12-hour shifts common = 4 days off)
- Career advancement to Nurse Practitioner (add 2 years, salary jumps to $110K-$130K)
- Travel nursing option ($2,500-$3,500/week during high demand)
- Better nurse-to-patient ratios = less burnout

**Section 4: Path #3 - Physician Assistant (The Long Game) (90 seconds)**

If you want to max out your medical career, PA is the ceiling for most medics.

[Visual suggestion: PA career details]

**Physician Assistant salary 2025:**
- Average: $105,000-$125,000/year
- Surgical PA: $115,000-$140,000/year
- ER PA: $110,000-$135,000/year

**Requirements:**
- Bachelor's degree (any field)
- 2,000-4,000 hours of direct patient care (your 68W time counts!)
- PA school: 2-3 years, master's degree level
- Prerequisites: Anatomy, physiology, chemistry, statistics

**Timeline from separation:**
- If you have bachelor's: 2-3 years PA school
- If you don't: 2-4 years bachelor's + 2-3 years PA school = 4-7 years total

**Cost:** $60,000-$120,000 for PA school (GI Bill covers most)

**Best PA programs for veterans:**
- University of Pittsburgh (veteran-friendly)
- Duke University (strong military support)
- Baylor College of Medicine
- Any program that counts military medical experience for clinical hours

**Reality check:** This is a 4-7 year investment. You'll be in school while your buddies are earning. But the ceiling is $140K+ with better work-life balance than physicians.

**This makes sense if:**
- You want to practice medicine at a high level
- You're willing to invest 4-7 years
- You already have a bachelor's degree (then it's only 2-3 years)
- You want prescribing authority and clinical autonomy

**Section 5: Alternative Paths (60 seconds)**

[Visual suggestion: Bullet list of other options]

**Surgical Tech:** $50,000-$60,000/year, 12-24 months training
**Respiratory Therapist:** $55,000-$75,000/year, 2-year degree
**Radiology Tech:** $60,000-$80,000/year, 2-year degree
**Occupational Therapy Assistant:** $55,000-$65,000/year, 2-year degree
**Medical Device Sales:** $70,000-$150,000/year (base + commission), bachelor's degree preferred

**Medical device sales** is interesting for 68Ws - you understand the clinical side, you can talk to doctors and nurses in their language, and top performers make $150K+ with experience. Companies actively recruit veteran medics.

- EMT refresher courses
- Paramedic certification
- Some nursing prerequisites

**Section 7: The Decision Framework (90 seconds)**

[Visual suggestion: Decision tree]

**Choose Paramedic if:**
- You need income within 3-6 months
- You love pre-hospital emergency medicine
- You want to work in fire departments (paramedic often required)
- You're okay with $48K-$65K salary ceiling
- You might pursue flight paramedic or critical care transport

**Choose RN if:**
- You want $90K+ salary
- You can commit 12-24 months to school
- You want career growth options (NP, CRNA, management)
- You prefer hospital-based care
- You want better work-life balance long-term

**Choose PA if:**
- You want to practice medicine at highest level without MD
- You can commit 4-7 years
- You want $105K-$140K salary
- You want prescribing authority
- You have or can get a bachelor's degree

**My recommendation for most 68Ws:**

Use your GI Bill for accelerated BSN program (12-18 months). Start as RN at $70K-$90K. Work for 2-3 years. Then decide:
- Happy as RN? Stay, make $100K+, work 3 days/week
- Want more? Apply to Nurse Practitioner school (employer often pays)
- Final salary as NP: $110K-$130K

This path gets you to six figures in 5 years total.
