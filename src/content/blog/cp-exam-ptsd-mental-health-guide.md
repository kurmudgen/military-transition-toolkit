# C&P Exam for PTSD: What to Expect and How to Prepare (2025)

The PTSD Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam is often the most important appointment in your VA disability claim. In 30-90 minutes, an examiner will assess your symptoms and provide an opinion that largely determines your rating.

Many veterans walk in unprepared and walk out with ratings that don't reflect their actual condition. Don't make that mistake. Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is the PTSD C&P Exam?

The C&P exam is a medical evaluation scheduled by the VA to:
1. Confirm your PTSD diagnosis
2. Assess symptom severity
3. Evaluate occupational and social impairment
4. Provide a medical opinion on service connection

The examiner—usually a psychologist or psychiatrist—will complete a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) that captures their findings in a standardized format.

## What to Expect

### Duration

PTSD exams typically last 30-90 minutes. Complex cases or multiple conditions may take longer.

### Setting

The exam takes place at:
- VA medical facility
- VA-contracted clinic (QTC, VES, LHI)
- Telehealth (video) in some cases

### Who Conducts the Exam

A licensed mental health professional:
- Psychologist (PhD or PsyD)
- Psychiatrist (MD or DO)
- Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) in some cases
- Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner

### Format

The exam is primarily an interview. There are no written tests required, though the examiner may ask you to complete brief symptom questionnaires.

## The Questions You'll Be Asked

### Background Questions

- What is your current employment status?
- What is your relationship status?
- Tell me about your military service
- What was your MOS/rate?
- Did you deploy? Where?

### Stressor Questions

The examiner needs to understand the traumatic event(s):

- Describe the traumatic event(s) you experienced
- When did this occur?
- Were you in fear for your life or safety?
- Did you witness death or serious injury?
- How did you respond at the time?

**Important**: You don't need to relive every detail. You can say "I experienced [type of event] during [deployment/time period] that involved [fear for life/witnessing death/etc.]" without graphic details.

### Current Symptom Questions

**Re-experiencing:**
- Do you have nightmares? How often?
- Do you have flashbacks or intrusive memories?
- Do you get distressed by reminders of the trauma?

**Avoidance:**
- Do you avoid thoughts or feelings about the trauma?
- Do you avoid places, people, or activities that remind you?
- Have you stopped doing things you used to enjoy?

**Negative changes in mood/cognition:**
- Do you have negative beliefs about yourself or the world?
- Do you blame yourself for what happened?
- Do you feel detached from others?
- Do you have trouble experiencing positive emotions?

**Arousal/reactivity:**
- Do you have angry outbursts?
- Do you engage in reckless or self-destructive behavior?
- Are you hypervigilant (always on guard)?
- Do you startle easily?
- Do you have trouble sleeping?
- Do you have trouble concentrating?

### Functional Impact Questions

- How do your symptoms affect your work?
- Can you maintain relationships?
- How do you spend your days?
- Do you have friends?
- Can you handle stress at work or home?
- Have you been hospitalized for mental health?
- Have you had suicidal thoughts?

## How Ratings Are Determined

The examiner will rate your **occupational and social impairment** based on symptoms:

| Rating | Level of Impairment |
|--------|-------------------|
| **0%** | Diagnosis confirmed but symptoms controlled or asymptomatic |
| **10%** | Mild symptoms during periods of significant stress |
| **30%** | Occasional decrease in work efficiency |
| **50%** | Reduced reliability and productivity |
| **70%** | Deficiencies in most areas |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment |

The examiner checks a box on the DBQ corresponding to your impairment level. This is what the VA uses for your rating.

## How to Prepare

### Before the Exam

**1. Review your records**
Know your treatment history, medications, hospitalizations.

**2. Write down your symptoms**
Create a list of all symptoms you experience. Bring it to the exam.

**3. Document your worst days**
Write specific examples of how PTSD affects your life:
- Specific incidents (panic attacks, outbursts, isolation episodes)
- Impact on work (missed days, conflicts, performance issues)
- Impact on relationships (fights, divorces, lost friendships)

**4. Prepare your stressor description**
You'll be asked about your traumatic event(s). Prepare a brief, factual description. You don't need to provide graphic details.

**5. List medications and treatments**
Know what you take and what treatments you've tried.

**6. Get adequate sleep**
Don't go to the exam exhausted (unless exhaustion is your normal state). You want to present accurately, not artificially worse or better.

### What to Bring

- Photo ID
- List of current medications
- List of mental health providers
- Written notes on symptoms (you can reference them)
- Specific examples of how PTSD affects daily life
- Any documents not already in your file

### Mental Preparation

Many veterans feel anxious about discussing traumatic events. Remember:
- You're in control of what you share
- You can take breaks
- You don't need to provide graphic details
- The examiner has done thousands of these exams
- Your goal is accurate assessment, not therapy

## During the Exam

### Be Honest

Don't exaggerate—examiners are trained to detect inconsistencies. But also **don't minimize**. Many veterans downplay symptoms out of habit.

### Describe Your Worst Days

The rating is based on your level of impairment, not your best day. Describe how bad it gets:

"Most days I can function, but two or three times a month I have episodes where I can't leave the house. Last month I had a flashback at work and had to leave."

### Use Specific Examples

Don't just say "I have anger issues." Say:

"Last week I snapped at my wife over nothing and put a hole in the wall. My kids were scared. This happens about twice a month."

### Explain Functional Impact

The examiner needs to understand how symptoms affect your life:

"I've been written up twice at work for conflicts with coworkers. I can't handle criticism without getting angry."

"I haven't maintained a friendship in years. I don't trust anyone."

"I check the locks on my house five times before bed. I sleep with a gun within reach."

### Don't Put on a Brave Face

This isn't a job interview. You don't get points for seeming okay.

**Wrong**: "I manage. I get by."
**Right**: "I struggle every day. I have to force myself to get out of bed. I've thought about ending it."

### If Asked About Suicidal Ideation

Be honest. Having suicidal thoughts is a symptom that affects your rating. Passive ideation ("I've thought about it but wouldn't act on it") is different from active planning—both are relevant.

If you're in crisis, tell the examiner. They can connect you with resources.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Minimizing Symptoms

"I'm fine, I handle it." This is how veterans are trained to be. But it results in underrating.

### 2. Not Disclosing the Full Picture

If you've had suicidal thoughts, violent outbursts, or hospitalizations—disclose them. These affect your rating.

### 3. Presenting on a Good Day

If you're having a rare good day, make sure the examiner knows this isn't typical. "Today I'm okay, but most days..."

### 4. Being Vague

Specific examples are more compelling than general statements.

### 5. Trying to Appear Tough

The military taught you to push through. This exam isn't about toughness—it's about accurate assessment of impairment.

### 6. Getting Defensive

The examiner may ask challenging questions to assess your symptoms. Don't get defensive—answer honestly.

### 7. Not Mentioning Secondary Symptoms

If PTSD has caused sleep problems, substance abuse, relationship destruction, unemployment—mention all of it.

## After the Exam

### What Happens Next

The examiner completes the DBQ and sends it to the VA. You won't get results at the exam.

### Timeline

Results typically take 2-6 weeks after the exam. Check eBenefits/VA.gov for updates.

### If You Disagree with the Rating

Options include:
- **Supplemental Claim**: Submit new evidence
- **Higher Level Review**: Request senior review for error
- **Board Appeal**: Formal appeal process

Many veterans with initial denials or low ratings succeed on appeal with additional evidence.

## Special Situations

### MST-Related PTSD

Military Sexual Trauma exams have special considerations:
- You can request a same-gender examiner
- Alternative evidence is accepted (behavior changes, buddy statements)
- You don't need to provide graphic details

### Multiple Stressors

If you have multiple traumatic events, you can discuss all of them. Your rating is based on overall impairment, not number of events.

### Combat vs. Non-Combat PTSD

Combat stressors are presumptively established by service in combat zones. Non-combat PTSD requires evidence of the stressor.

### Already in Treatment

If you're already being treated for PTSD at the VA, bring your treatment records. Consistent treatment actually supports your claim.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until I get results?

Typically 2-6 weeks after the exam, though it can vary.

### Can I bring someone with me?

Generally yes, for waiting room support. They usually can't be in the exam room, but ask—accommodations may be possible.

### What if I have a panic attack during the exam?

Tell the examiner you need a break. They can pause the exam. This also demonstrates symptom severity.

### Can I record the exam?

Policy varies by location. Ask before the exam. You can always take notes immediately after.

### What if the examiner seems dismissive?

Answer questions thoroughly regardless. Request a copy of the DBQ afterward. If findings are inaccurate, appeal.

### Do I need to describe my trauma in graphic detail?

No. You can provide a general description: "I was involved in a firefight where I saw fellow soldiers killed" is sufficient without reliving every detail.

## Bottom Line

The PTSD C&P exam is your opportunity to show how your condition actually affects your life. Many veterans fail to do this because they minimize symptoms, present on a good day, or don't prepare.

Key takeaways:
- Prepare specific examples of how PTSD affects you
- Describe your worst days, not your best
- Don't minimize or put on a brave face
- Be honest about suicidal thoughts, anger, isolation
- Explain functional impact on work and relationships
- Bring notes—you can reference them during the exam

Your rating depends largely on this exam. Prepare accordingly.
