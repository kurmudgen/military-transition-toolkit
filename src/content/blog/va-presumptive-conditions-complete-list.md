# VA Presumptive Conditions: Complete List for Easy Service Connection

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Presumptive conditions** are disabilities the VA automatically connects to specific military service—**no nexus letter required**. If you served in certain locations/eras and develop a presumptive condition, service connection is presumed. This makes claims significantly easier to win. Know your presumptive conditions—they could be the key to your VA benefits.

## What Does "Presumptive" Mean?

### Normal VA Claims

Require proving:
1. Current diagnosis
2. In-service event/exposure
3. **Medical nexus** linking them

### Presumptive Claims

Require only:
1. Qualifying service (location/dates)
2. Current diagnosis
3. **No nexus needed** - connection is presumed

**The VA presumes your condition was caused by service. You don't have to prove it.**

## How to Claim Presumptive Conditions

### Step 1: Verify Qualifying Service

Check your:
- DD-214
- Deployment orders
- Service records

Confirm you meet the location/date requirements.

### Step 2: Get Diagnosed

You need a current diagnosis of the presumptive condition from a doctor.

### Step 3: File Your Claim

VA Form 21-526EZ:
- List the condition
- Note your qualifying service
- Include supporting documents

### Step 4: C&P Exam

VA will likely schedule an exam to:
- Confirm diagnosis
- Determine severity (for rating)

### Step 5: Rating Decision

If you have:
- Qualifying service
- Confirmed diagnosis

Service connection should be granted. No nexus required.

## Tips for Presumptive Claims

### Document Your Service

Ensure your records show:
- Dates of service
- Locations served
- Any specific activities (radiation, combat, etc.)

### Get Proper Diagnosis

The diagnosis must match the presumptive condition list. Work with your doctor to ensure accurate diagnosis.

### File Everything

If you have multiple presumptive conditions, claim them all. Each adds to your combined rating.

### Use a VSO

VSOs know presumptive conditions and can help ensure you claim everything you're entitled to.

### Don't Assume Denial

Some veterans assume they won't qualify. If you have qualifying service and a diagnosis, file.

## Previously Denied? Reopen

If you were denied before a condition became presumptive:
- File a Supplemental Claim
- Cite the new presumptive status
- VA should reconsider

**PACT Act example:** Veteran denied for sinusitis in 2020. Sinusitis now presumptive under PACT Act. File Supplemental Claim—should now be granted.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Presumptive = no nexus needed** - Much easier claims
2. **Know your era** - Different conditions for different service periods
3. **PACT Act expanded** presumptives significantly
4. **One-year rule** applies to chronic diseases after separation
5. **Reopen denied claims** if condition became presumptive
6. **Document qualifying service** - Records matter
7. **File everything** - More conditions = higher combined rating

Presumptive conditions are the fastest path to service connection. Know which ones apply to your service.
