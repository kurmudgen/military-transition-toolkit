### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Lesson 2.2 - Quantification and Impact]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome back! You've eliminated the jargon from your resume. Now it's time to make your accomplishments pop with the one thing civilian hiring managers love more than anything else: numbers.

**[ON SCREEN: "Numbers Make You 3X More Likely to Get Interviews"]**

Here's a fact: resumes with quantified accomplishments are three times more likely to get interviews than resumes with vague, qualitative statements. Three times!

In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to find numbers hiding in your military experience and use them to demonstrate concrete, measurable impact. Every single bullet point on your resume should include at least one number. Ideally, two or three.

Let's turn your accomplishments into hard data that hiring managers can't ignore.

### PART 1: THE FIVE TYPES OF QUANTIFICATION (0:30-4:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Five Ways to Quantify Your Military Experience"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
There are five main categories of numbers you can extract from your military experience. Let's go through each one with real examples.

**[ON SCREEN: Type 1 - Budget and Financial Responsibility]**

**TYPE 1: BUDGET AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY**

Every piece of military equipment has a dollar value. Every unit has a budget. You just need to identify what you were responsible for.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What was the total value of equipment in your hand receipt?
- What was your unit or section's annual operating budget?
- What contracts did you manage or oversee?
- How much money did your process improvement or initiative save?

**Real Examples:**

**E-5 Army Squad Leader:**
Before: "Responsible for squad equipment"
After: "Managed equipment inventory valued at $850K with 100% accountability and zero loss incidents"

**E-7 Navy Chief:**
Before: "Oversaw work center operations"
After: "Managed $2.3M annual operating budget for 32-person work center, maintaining 98% budget execution rate"

**E-6 Marine Supply Sergeant:**
Before: "Improved supply efficiency"
After: "Streamlined procurement process, reducing costs by $47K annually (12% cost reduction)"

**[ON SCREEN: "If you managed it, it has a dollar value"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Even if you don't know the exact dollar amount, you can estimate conservatively. Look up equipment values in your service's supply system, or use reasonable estimates.

A military vehicle: $200K-$800K depending on type
A weapons system: $500-$50K depending on complexity
IT equipment per user: $2K-$5K (computer, phone, peripherals)
Your unit's annual budget: Ask your S-4 or admin chief

**[ON SCREEN: Type 2 - People and Team Size]**

**TYPE 2: PEOPLE AND TEAM SIZE**

This is the easiest one for E5-E9 leaders. How many people did you lead, supervise, train, or work with?

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- How many direct reports did you have?
- How many total personnel in your unit/section/platoon/company?
- How many people did you train in your role?
- How many subordinate leaders reported to you?
- How many people did your decisions impact?

**Real Examples:**

**E-6 Air Force Technical Sergeant:**
Before: "Led team"
After: "Supervised 14-person maintenance team including 2 team leads, conducting 28 performance evaluations annually"

**E-8 Army Master Sergeant:**
Before: "Senior NCO for company"
After: "Senior enlisted advisor for 120-person organization across 4 platoons, managing leadership development for 18 NCOs"

**E-7 Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer:**
Before: "Trained personnel on safety procedures"
After: "Developed and delivered safety training to 340+ personnel over 3-year period, achieving 100% certification compliance"

**[ON SCREEN: Type 3 - Time and Efficiency Improvements]**

**TYPE 3: TIME AND EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS**

Did you make something faster, more efficient, or less time-consuming? Quantify it!

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- How much time did your improvement save (per day, week, or process)?
- What was the percentage efficiency gain?
- How many man-hours did you eliminate or reduce?
- What process did you speed up and by how much?

**Real Examples:**

**E-5 Marine Corporal:**
Before: "Improved maintenance process"
After: "Reduced vehicle maintenance time from 6 hours to 4 hours per service (33% efficiency gain), increasing fleet availability"

**E-7 Navy Senior Chief:**
Before: "Streamlined reporting procedures"
After: "Automated data reporting process, eliminating 22 hours of manual work weekly and reducing errors by 85%"

**E-6 Army Staff Sergeant:**
Before: "Improved supply chain"
After: "Redesigned supply requisition workflow, reducing approval time from 7 days to 2 days (71% reduction)"

**[ON SCREEN: Type 4 - Volume and Scale of Work]**

**TYPE 4: VOLUME AND SCALE OF WORK**

How much work did you handle? How many events, operations, requests, or transactions?

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- How many missions/operations/events did you execute?
- How many requests/orders/reports did you process?
- How many customers/patients/personnel did you support?
- What was the frequency of your work (daily, weekly, monthly)?

**Real Examples:**

**E-6 Navy Petty Officer (Medical):**
Before: "Provided patient care during deployment"
After: "Delivered primary care services to 750+ patients during 9-month deployment, conducting 2,800+ medical appointments with 98% patient satisfaction"

**E-7 Army Platoon Sergeant:**
Before: "Led training exercises"
After: "Planned and executed 47 training events over 2-year period, certifying 180 personnel across 12 mission-essential tasks"

**E-5 Air Force Staff Sergeant (Logistics):**
Before: "Processed supply requests"
After: "Managed 1,400+ supply transactions monthly with 99.2% accuracy rate, supporting 250-person squadron operations"

**[ON SCREEN: Type 5 - Results and Impact]**

**TYPE 5: RESULTS AND IMPACT**

What was the measurable outcome of your work? What improved because of your efforts?

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What percentage improvement did you achieve?
- What rating did your unit/section receive?
- What was prevented (incidents, losses, accidents)?
- What awards or recognition did you/your team earn?
- How did readiness or performance metrics change under your leadership?

**Real Examples:**

**E-8 Marine Gunnery Sergeant:**
Before: "Improved unit readiness"
After: "Increased unit readiness from 72% to 94% over 8-month period, earning 'Excellent' rating on Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation"

**E-6 Army Sergeant:**
Before: "Maintained good safety record"
After: "Led 1,200 flight hours and 300 vehicle convoy miles with zero safety incidents or equipment loss over 12-month combat deployment"

**E-7 Navy Chief:**
Before: "Managed quality assurance program"
After: "Implemented quality control procedures resulting in 40% reduction in equipment failures and $125K cost avoidance annually"

### PART 2: THE NUMBERS FORMULA (4:00-7:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "The Perfect Resume Bullet Formula"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now that you know the five types of numbers, let me give you the formula for the perfect resume bullet point:

**[ON SCREEN: Formula breakdown]**

**ACTION VERB + WHO/WHAT + HOW MANY/MUCH + RESULT**

Let me break this down:

**COMPONENT 1: ACTION VERB**
Start with a strong action verb (we'll cover this in detail in the next lesson)
Examples: Managed, Led, Supervised, Coordinated, Implemented, Directed

**COMPONENT 2: WHO/WHAT**
Who did you lead or what did you manage?
Examples: "15-person team," "equipment inventory," "training program," "security operations"

**COMPONENT 3: HOW MANY/MUCH**
This is your quantification - include 2-3 numbers when possible
Examples: "valued at $2M," "across 6 locations," "over 18-month period," "with 95% success rate"

**COMPONENT 4: RESULT**
What was the measurable outcome?
Examples: "achieving zero loss," "exceeding standard by 15%," "earning top unit rating," "with 100% on-time delivery"

**[ON SCREEN: Formula in action - multiple examples]**

Let's see this formula in action:

**Example 1:**
**Action:** Supervised
**Who/What:** 12-person logistics team
**How many/much:** managing $3.2M equipment inventory across 4 geographic locations
**Result:** with zero loss incidents over 24-month period

**FULL BULLET:**
"Supervised 12-person logistics team managing $3.2M equipment inventory across 4 geographic locations with zero loss incidents over 24-month period"

**Example 2:**
**Action:** Implemented
**Who/What:** new maintenance tracking system
**How many/much:** for 22-vehicle fleet valued at $8.5M
**Result:** reducing downtime by 35% and increasing operational readiness to 97%

**FULL BULLET:**
"Implemented new maintenance tracking system for 22-vehicle fleet valued at $8.5M, reducing downtime by 35% and increasing operational readiness to 97%"

**Example 3:**
**Action:** Directed
**Who/What:** training program
**How many/much:** for 85 personnel across 6-month period
**Result:** achieving 100% certification rate and exceeding standard by 18%

**FULL BULLET:**
"Directed comprehensive training program for 85 personnel across 6-month period, achieving 100% certification rate and exceeding standard by 18%"

**[ON SCREEN: "Aim for 2-3 numbers per bullet"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Notice that each of these bullets has 2-3 specific numbers. That's your target. If you only have one number, see if you can add context like:
- Time period (over 18 months, during 2-year tenure)
- Team size (leading 12-person team)
- Percentage improvement (30% increase, 85% reduction)

---

### PART 3: FINDING HIDDEN NUMBERS (7:00-10:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Where to Find Numbers You Didn't Know You Had"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
A lot of veterans tell me: "I don't have any numbers to use." That's never true. You just haven't looked in the right places.

Let me show you where to find hidden numbers in your military career:

**[ON SCREEN: Source 1 - Evaluation Reports]**

**SOURCE 1: YOUR EVALUATION REPORTS (NCOERs/FITREPs/EPRs)**

Pull out every evaluation you received. Look for:
- Specific accomplishments mentioned
- Numbers of people you led or trained
- Ratings or rankings ("top 10% of peers")
- Special projects or initiatives you completed

Your rater already quantified your performance - use those numbers!

**[ON SCREEN: Source 2 - Awards and Decorations]**

**SOURCE 2: AWARD CITATIONS**

Read your Army Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal, or other award citations. They usually include:
- Specific events or operations
- Numbers of personnel impacted
- Dollar values of programs managed
- Results achieved

Even if you don't list the award itself, you can use the accomplishments described in the citation.

**[ON SCREEN: Source 3 - Training Records]**

**SOURCE 3: TRAINING RECORDS AND CERTIFICATIONS**

How many people did you train? How many hours of training did you complete?
Examples:
- "Completed 240 hours of leadership development training"
- "Certified 47 personnel on new equipment system"
- "Instructor for 12-week training course graduating 120+ students"

**[ON SCREEN: Source 4 - Unit Documents]**

**SOURCE 4: UNIT DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS**

If you still have access to unit records or your own files, look for:
- Budget documents (your section's annual budget)
- Hand receipts (equipment dollar values)
- Operation orders (numbers of personnel, duration, scope)
- After Action Reviews (results, metrics, improvements)

**[ON SCREEN: Source 5 - Memory and Estimation]**

**SOURCE 5: REASONABLE ESTIMATION**

If you can't find exact numbers, make reasonable estimates:

"About how many people were in your platoon?" → 40-45
"Approximately what was your unit's budget?" → Check with former colleagues or estimate conservatively
"How many operations did you run per month?" → Estimate based on deployment length

**[ON SCREEN: "Be honest, but don't undersell yourself"]**

Just be conservative and honest. Don't inflate numbers, but don't undersell your experience either.

Instead of guessing wildly, use ranges:
- "Managed 40-50 person team"
- "Equipment valued at $2M+"
- "Trained 300+ personnel"

The "+" sign indicates "at least this many" which is honest if you can't remember the exact number.

### PART 4: BEFORE/AFTER TRANSFORMATIONS (10:30-13:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Real Resume Transformations"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now let me show you complete before-and-after transformations using quantification.

**[ON SCREEN: Example 1 - E-6 Army Staff Sergeant, Infantry]**

**BEFORE (No quantification):**
- Squad leader responsible for soldiers and equipment
- Conducted training for my squad
- Maintained good safety record
- Led patrols during deployment

**AFTER (Fully quantified):**
- Led 11-person infantry squad with $1.2M equipment accountability, achieving 100% accountability and zero loss over 3-year period
- Designed and delivered 40+ training events, certifying squad on 15 mission-essential tasks with 95% first-time pass rate
- Maintained zero safety incidents across 1,800 training hours and 300+ live-fire exercises spanning 3-year tenure
- Planned and executed 127 combat patrols during 12-month deployment to Afghanistan, completing 100% of missions with zero friendly casualties

**[ON SCREEN: "From vague to powerful with numbers"]**

See the transformation? Every bullet now includes:
- Specific team size
- Dollar values or quantities
- Percentages or ratings
- Time periods
- Measurable results

**[ON SCREEN: Example 2 - E-7 Navy Senior Chief, Logistics]**

**BEFORE (No quantification):**
- Managed supply operations for ship

- Supervised 18-person supply department including 3 section leads, conducting 54 performance evaluations and developing 2 personnel promoted to E-6
- Led 4 major inspections achieving 'Outstanding' ratings in all categories, marking best performance in 5-year period

**[ON SCREEN: Example 3 - E-8 Air Force Senior Master Sergeant, IT]**

**BEFORE (No quantification):**
- Senior IT leader for squadron
- Managed network operations
- Oversaw cybersecurity
- Led team of technicians

**AFTER (Fully quantified):**
- Senior IT leader managing 22-person technology department supporting 850+ users across 6 buildings with $3.2M IT infrastructure

### PART 5: QUANTIFICATION MISTAKES TO AVOID (13:30-14:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Common Quantification Mistakes"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Before we wrap up, let me show you the mistakes to avoid when quantifying your experience:

**MISTAKE #1: Using numbers that don't mean anything to civilians**

❌ Wrong: "Scored 285 on APFT"
✅ Right: "Consistently exceeded physical fitness standards, scoring in top 15% of unit"

❌ Wrong: "Qualified Expert on rifle (38/40)"
✅ Right: Omit this unless applying for law enforcement/security role, then: "Achieved advanced proficiency in weapons systems"

**MISTAKE #2: Being too vague with numbers**

❌ Wrong: "Managed several teams"
✅ Right: "Managed 4 teams totaling 38 personnel"

❌ Wrong: "Saved money through efficiency improvements"
✅ Right: "Reduced costs by $67K annually (22% cost savings) through process optimization"

**MISTAKE #3: Exaggerating or inflating numbers**

Don't say you managed "$10M in equipment" if you had a hand receipt for $500K worth of gear.
Don't say you "led 100 people" if you were a squad leader with 12.
Don't claim credit for unit-level results unless you directly contributed.

Be honest. Your real numbers are impressive enough.

**MISTAKE #4: Including too many irrelevant numbers**

❌ Wrong: "Completed 240 hours of mandatory annual training"
✅ Right: Omit this - every service member does mandatory training

❌ Wrong: "Achieved 3.2 GPA in military courses"
✅ Right: Only include if honors/top of class, otherwise omit

**MISTAKE #5: Numbers without context**

❌ Wrong: "Managed $2M"
✅ Right: "Managed $2M equipment inventory" or "Oversaw $2M annual budget"

Always explain what the number represents.
