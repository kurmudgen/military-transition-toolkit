# Hip Pain Secondary to Knee Condition: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Strong biomechanical connection
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-20% per hip
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected knee condition, hip diagnosis, gait analysis, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate to High (60-70%) with proper documentation

Hip conditions secondary to knee disabilities represent one of the clearest examples of the orthopedic "kinetic chain" principle. When your knee doesn't work properly, your hip must compensate—often leading to hip degeneration, bursitis, or other conditions over time.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability. Veterans receive additional compensation for secondary conditions.

For hip problems secondary to knee condition:
- Your knee condition must already be service-connected
- You must have a diagnosed hip condition
- Medical evidence must link your hip problems to your knee condition

## How Hip Problems Relate to Knee Conditions

### Biomechanical Connection

Knee conditions cause hip problems through several mechanisms:

**Altered Gait Pattern:**
- Limping from knee pain shifts stress to hip
- Trendelenburg gait (hip drop) develops
- Shortened stride changes hip loading
- Favoring one leg overloads opposite hip

**Compensatory Mechanics:**
- Hip muscles work harder to protect knee
- Abnormal rotation patterns stress hip joint
- Pelvic tilt to avoid knee pain strains hip
- Weight-bearing shifts place asymmetric hip load

**Muscle Imbalances:**
- Quadriceps weakness affects hip stabilizers
- Gluteal muscles become overworked
- Hip flexor tightness develops
- Abductor weakness progresses

**Reduced Mobility:**
- Knee stiffness forces hip to provide more motion
- Hip joint bears extra rotational stress
- Compensatory hip movement accelerates wear
- Both ipsilateral and contralateral hips affected

### Common Progression

**Months 1-12 after knee condition:**
- Subtle hip discomfort during walking
- Fatigue in hip muscles
- Stiffness after prolonged sitting
- Barely noticeable gait changes

**Months 12-36:**
- Persistent hip pain develops
- Pain with getting in/out of car
- Groin discomfort
- Sleep disturbance from hip pain

**Months 36-60:**
- Chronic hip condition established
- Imaging shows degenerative changes
- Daily symptoms
- Significant functional impact

**Beyond 60 months:**
- Advanced hip pathology possible
- May need hip replacement
- Combined knee-hip disability severe
- Mobility significantly impaired

### Prevalence

The knee-hip relationship is well-established:

- **Veterans with knee conditions have 2x higher** rates of hip pathology
- **30-50% of people with chronic knee pain** develop hip problems
- **Gait abnormalities** are present in nearly all chronic knee conditions
- **Hip replacement rates** are elevated in patients with prior knee problems
- **Ipsilateral hip** (same side) most commonly affected, but contralateral can be impacted too

## VA Rating Criteria for Hip Conditions

Hips are rated under 38 CFR § 4.71a. Multiple diagnostic codes may apply:

**Diagnostic Code 5003 - Degenerative Arthritis:**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | X-ray evidence with painful motion |
| 20% | With occasional incapacitating exacerbations |

**Diagnostic Code 5252 - Limitation of Flexion:**
| Rating | Flexion Limited To |
|--------|-------------------|
| 0% | Greater than 45 degrees |
| 10% | 45 degrees |
| 20% | 30 degrees |
| 30% | 20 degrees |
| 40% | 10 degrees |

**Diagnostic Code 5251 - Limitation of Extension:**
| Rating | Extension Limited To |
|--------|---------------------|
| 10% | 5 degrees |

**Diagnostic Code 5253 - Limitation of Rotation/Adduction:**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Cannot cross legs or toe-out more than 15 degrees |
| 20% | Motion limited to beyond 10 degrees from neutral |

**Diagnostic Code 5019 - Bursitis:**
Rated on limitation of motion of affected joint.

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition (Knee)
- Service connection documentation
- Current knee rating
- Treatment records showing knee problems
- Physical therapy records noting gait abnormality
- Documentation of knee limitations

#### For Your Secondary Condition (Hip)
- Diagnosis of specific hip condition (arthritis, bursitis, labral tear, etc.)
- Imaging (X-rays, MRI) showing pathology
- Treatment records
- Range of motion measurements
- Documentation of symptoms

### Gait Analysis Evidence (Critical)

Gait abnormality links the conditions. Document through:

**Medical Records:**
- Physical therapy notes describing gait pattern
- Physician observations of limping
- Video gait analysis if available
- Documented use of assistive devices

**Personal Observations:**
- Description of your walking pattern
- Which side you favor
- Activities that worsen symptoms
- How knee affects your gait

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

Your nexus letter must explain the biomechanical connection.

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Orthopedist, physiatrist, or physician
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Hip diagnosis** - Specific condition diagnosed
4. **Causal statement** - "At least as likely as not" language
5. **Biomechanical explanation** - How knee condition caused hip problems
6. **Gait analysis** - Description of altered gait pattern

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including service treatment records, VA orthopedic records, imaging studies, and physical therapy records. [Veteran] is service-connected for right knee degenerative joint disease at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] has been diagnosed with right hip osteoarthritis/trochanteric bursitis [or other specific diagnosis], confirmed by physical examination and imaging showing [specific findings].*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] right hip condition is at least as likely as not (50% probability or greater) caused by the service-connected right knee condition.*

*Biomechanical Rationale: [Veteran's] knee condition has resulted in significant gait alteration. Physical examination demonstrates antalgic gait with shortened stance phase on the right, compensatory hip drop, and reduced knee flexion during swing phase. These gait abnormalities have been documented in physical therapy records.*

*This altered gait pattern has resulted in abnormal mechanical loading of the ipsilateral hip joint. The knee and hip function as a linked kinetic system—dysfunction at the knee forces compensatory changes at the hip. The medical literature establishes that chronic knee conditions lead to hip pathology through altered biomechanics (Zeni & Higginson, 2009; Mills et al., 2013).*

*The onset of hip symptoms approximately [X] months/years after the knee condition stabilized is consistent with the expected timeline for secondary degenerative changes."*

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No gait documentation** - The link is through altered gait; document thoroughly

2. **No imaging** - X-rays or MRI showing hip pathology strengthen claim

3. **Vague nexus letter** - Letter must explain specific biomechanical mechanism

4. **Forgetting contralateral hip** - Compensating for bad knee can also damage other hip

5. **Not claiming bursitis if present** - Trochanteric bursitis from altered gait is common

6. **Missing the timeline** - Document when hip problems started relative to knee

7. **Understating at C&P exam** - Demonstrate actual limitations

8. **Not mentioning muscle weakness** - Weakness from knee affects hip stability

9. **Ignoring labral tears** - If diagnosed, include in claim

10. **Waiting too long** - The longer you wait, the more the VA may attribute to aging

## Medical Research Supporting Connection

**Key Studies:**

- **Zeni & Higginson (2009)** - Demonstrated altered hip biomechanics in patients with knee osteoarthritis

- **Mills et al. (2013)** - Showed compensatory hip patterns develop from knee dysfunction

- **Farrokhi et al. (2016)** - Established kinetic chain relationship between knee and hip pathology

- **Shakoor et al. (2006)** - Documented asymmetric gait from knee conditions affecting hip loading

- **Chang et al. (2005)** - Showed contralateral limb compensation patterns from unilateral knee disease

**Orthopedic Principles:**
The kinetic chain concept is fundamental to orthopedics—the hip, knee, and ankle function as an integrated system. Dysfunction at one level affects the others.

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Hip Arthritis from Knee Condition

**Background:** 48-year-old Army veteran, 30% right knee DJD
**Timeline:** Hip problems developed 5 years after knee injury

**Evidence:**
- Orthopedist diagnosis of right hip OA
- Hip X-rays showing joint space narrowing
- Gait analysis showing right-sided limp
- Nexus letter from orthopedic surgeon
- Personal statement describing gait changes
- PT records documenting compensatory pattern

**Outcome:** 10% for right hip under DC 5003
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 40%
**Monthly Increase:** $131.70

### Case Study 2: Bilateral Hip Bursitis from Severe Knee Condition

**Background:** 55-year-old Marine veteran, 30% left knee with instability
**Claim:** Both hips affected by altered gait

**Evidence:**
- Bilateral trochanteric bursitis diagnosis
- Documentation of Trendelenburg gait
- Both hips tender to palpation
- Nexus explaining bilateral impact of compensating for unstable knee

**Outcome:** 10% right hip + 10% left hip under DC 5019
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 40%

### Case Study 3: Contralateral Hip Affected

**Background:** 42-year-old Navy veteran, 20% right knee condition
**Claim:** Left hip secondary to right knee (from overloading good leg)

**Evidence:**
- Left hip OA diagnosed
- Documentation of putting more weight on left side
- Nexus letter explaining contralateral compensation mechanism
- Physical therapy notes confirming weight shift

**Outcome:** 10% for left hip
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 30%

**Key Lesson:** Both same-side and opposite-side hip can be secondary to knee.

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Example 1: Knee 30% + Hip 10%**
- Knee: 30%, 70% healthy
- Hip: 10% of 70% = 7%
- Combined: 30% + 7% = 37% → Rounds to 40%
- Monthly: $524.31

**Example 2: Knee 20% + Both Hips 10%**
- Knee: 20%, 80% healthy
- Right hip: 10% of 80% = 8%
- Left hip: 10% of 72% = 7.2%
- Combined: 20% + 8% + 7.2% = 35.2% → Rounds to 40%
- Monthly: $524.31

**Example 3: Multiple Lower Extremity Conditions**
- Right knee: 20%
- Left knee: 10%
- Right hip: 20%
- Left hip: 10%

### Strengthening Your Claim

1. **Formal gait analysis** - Physical therapy or biomechanics evaluation

2. **Orthopedic specialist opinion** - Surgeon or physiatrist

3. **MRI imaging** - More detailed findings than X-ray

4. **Video evidence** - Of your gait pattern

5. **Timeline documentation** - Clear progression from knee to hip symptoms

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I claim both hips even if only one knee is service-connected?**
A: Yes. Compensating for one bad knee can affect both hips.

**Q: What if my hip pain started before my knee was service-connected?**
A: If hip problems developed after knee condition (regardless of when VA rated it), you can still claim.

**Q: Is same-side or opposite-side hip more commonly affected?**
A: Same side (ipsilateral) is more common, but opposite side can be affected from overloading.

**Q: Do I need an MRI or will X-rays suffice?**
A: X-rays are usually sufficient, but MRI can show early changes and soft tissue problems.

**Q: Can I claim hip if I also have back problems?**
A: Yes. Hip can be secondary to knee regardless of other conditions.

**Q: What if the C&P examiner only focuses on range of motion?**
A: Mention gait abnormality, pain, and functional impact during exam.

**Q: Will claiming hip affect my knee rating?**
A: No. Each joint is rated separately.

**Q: Can hip replacement be secondary to knee condition?**
A: Yes. If knee-related degeneration led to need for hip replacement.

**Q: What type of doctor is best for the nexus letter?**
A: Orthopedic surgeon or physiatrist who understands kinetic chain biomechanics.

**Q: How long does it take for hip to be affected by knee?**
A: Typically months to years. The VA understands this takes time.
