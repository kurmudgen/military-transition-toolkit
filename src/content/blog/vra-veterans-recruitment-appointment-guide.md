# VRA (Veterans Recruitment Appointment) Guide: Non-Competitive Federal Hiring

What if you could get a federal job without competing against hundreds of other applicants?

That's exactly what VRA—Veterans Recruitment Appointment—offers. It's a special hiring authority that lets agencies hire eligible veterans non-competitively for positions up to GS-11 (or equivalent).

Non-competitive means no ranked certificates, no competing for limited slots, no worrying about whether your questionnaire score was high enough. If you're qualified and the agency wants you, you can be hired.

This guide explains everything about VRA: who's eligible, how it works, and how to leverage it for your federal career.

## What is VRA?

VRA is a special hiring authority that allows federal agencies to appoint eligible veterans to positions at GS-11 and below (or equivalent) without competition.

### Key VRA Features

**Non-competitive appointment:** Agency can hire you directly without posting on USAJOBS or rating/ranking candidates.

**Excepted service appointment:** You're initially hired into the excepted service (not competitive service), but can convert after 2 years.

**Up to GS-11:** VRA covers grades GS-11 and below, plus equivalent WG (Wage Grade) positions.

**Pathway to career:** After successful 2-year VRA appointment, you convert to competitive service (career conditional appointment).

## VRA Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for VRA, you must meet ALL of the following:

### Requirement 1: Service Criteria

You must have served on active duty in the Armed Forces AND meet one of these conditions:

**Option A: Disabled Veteran**
- Served on active duty and have a service-connected disability, OR
- Eligible for disability compensation under laws administered by VA

**Option B: Campaign Badge or Expeditionary Medal**
- Served on active duty and received a campaign badge or expeditionary medal

**Option C: Armed Forces Service Medal**
- Veteran who served on active duty during a war, or in a campaign/expedition for which a campaign badge is authorized
- Includes: Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, etc.

**Option D: Recent Separation (within 3 years)**
- Separated from active duty within the past 3 years

### Requirement 2: Character of Discharge

- Honorable discharge, OR
- General under honorable conditions discharge

**Not eligible:**
- Other Than Honorable (OTH)
- Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD)
- Dishonorable Discharge

### Requirement 3: Position Grade

- Position must be at GS-11 or below
- Includes WG positions at equivalent levels
- Does NOT apply to positions above GS-11

### Eligibility Timeline

**The 3-year rule:**
If you don't meet Options A, B, or C (disability, campaign badge, etc.), Option D limits your VRA eligibility to 3 years after separation.

**Indefinite eligibility:**
If you have a service-connected disability, your VRA eligibility does not expire.

**Example:**
- Separated June 2022 with honorable discharge and Armed Forces Service Medal
- VRA eligible: Indefinitely (campaign medal)

- Separated June 2022 with honorable discharge, no campaign medal or disability
- VRA eligible: Until June 2025 (3 years from separation)

## How VRA Hiring Works

### The Non-Competitive Process

1. **Agency identifies need:** Hiring manager has position to fill
2. **Manager decides to use VRA:** Choose to fill via VRA authority
3. **Find VRA-eligible candidate:** Through networking, resume database, targeted outreach
4. **Verify eligibility:** Candidate provides DD-214 and disability documentation if applicable
5. **Qualification verification:** Candidate must meet position requirements
6. **Appointment:** Hire into excepted service via VRA authority

Notice what's missing: No USAJOBS posting required, no competitive examination, no certificate of eligibles.

### The Reality

In practice, many VRA positions ARE posted on USAJOBS, but:
- The announcement may state "VRA eligible veterans encouraged to apply"
- The position is filled non-competitively among VRA applicants
- Or, hiring managers use VRA after finding qualified candidates through other means

### VRA vs. Competitive Service

| Aspect | VRA (Excepted) | Competitive Service |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Initial appointment | Excepted service | Competitive service |
| Competition required | No | Yes |
| Probationary period | 2 years | 1 year |
| Conversion to career | After 2 years | After 1 year |
| Appeal rights | Limited initially | Full from start |
| Eligible for merit promotion | After conversion | Immediately |

### The 2-Year Conversion

After 2 years of successful VRA employment:
1. You convert to career conditional appointment (competitive service)
2. Full merit system protections apply
3. Eligible for merit promotion to any grade
4. No further limitations from initial VRA appointment

**This is crucial:** VRA is a pathway INTO the competitive federal workforce, not a permanent limitation.

## Finding VRA Opportunities

### Strategy 1: USAJOBS Search

Search for positions open to veterans/VRA:
- Filter by "Veterans" under "Who May Apply"
- Look for announcements mentioning VRA in text
- Target grades GS-11 and below

### Strategy 2: Direct Agency Contact

VRA allows non-competitive hiring, so you can:
- Contact agency HR offices directly
- Send resume to hiring managers
- Attend agency career fairs
- Ask about VRA opportunities specifically

**Sample outreach email:**

> Subject: VRA-Eligible Veteran Seeking Opportunities
>
> Dear [Hiring Manager/HR Contact],
>
> I am a VRA-eligible veteran recently separated from the [Army/Navy/Air Force/Marines/Coast Guard]. I am interested in [position type] opportunities within [agency/office].
>
> I have [X years] of experience in [relevant area] and hold [relevant qualifications]. My DD-214 confirms my eligibility for Veterans Recruitment Appointment consideration.
>
> I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my military experience aligns with your team's needs. I have attached my federal resume for your review.
>
> Respectfully,
> [Your Name]
> [Contact Information]

### Strategy 3: Veteran Employment Coordinators

Federal agencies have designated Veteran Employment Program Offices:
- Find your target agency's VEPM (Veteran Employment Program Manager)
- Contact them specifically about VRA opportunities
- They can connect you with hiring managers

### Strategy 4: Networking

Many VRA hires happen through connections:
- Connect with veterans already in federal service
- Attend agency veteran hiring events
- Use LinkedIn to find agency contacts
- Leverage military transition assistance networks

## VRA by Agency

Some agencies use VRA heavily, others less so:

### Heavy VRA Users

**Department of Defense (Civilian)**
- DoD components actively recruit via VRA
- Contact DCPAS and service-specific civilian HR
- Many technical and support positions

**Department of Veterans Affairs**
- Natural fit for veteran employees
- Healthcare, administration, benefits positions
- Active VRA recruitment programs

**Department of Homeland Security**
- DHS components use VRA regularly
- Border security, immigration, emergency management
- TSA, CBP, ICE positions

**Department of Justice**
- Law enforcement support positions
- Administrative roles
- Corrections and investigations support

### Agencies with Formal VRA Programs

Some agencies have structured VRA hiring:
- VA Veteran Employment Program
- DoD Operation Warfighter (for wounded warriors)
- DHS Veteran Recruitment Program

Research each agency's veteran hiring initiatives.

## VRA Positions: Grade Limitations and Career Paths

### The GS-11 Ceiling

VRA only applies to positions at GS-11 and below:
- GS-1 through GS-11 covered
- WG (Wage Grade) equivalent positions covered
- Cannot use VRA for GS-12, GS-13, etc.

### What This Means for Your Career

**Entry to mid-level:** VRA is excellent for getting in the door at:
- GS-5/7/9/11 professional positions
- WG-5 through WG-11 trade positions
- Administrative and technical support roles

**Advancement after VRA:** Once hired via VRA, your career path is unlimited:
- After 2-year conversion, compete for any grade
- Career ladder positions can promote you above GS-11
- Merit promotion opens all positions

### Career Ladder Positions

Many federal positions have built-in career ladders:
- **GS-5/7/9** → Hired at GS-5, promote to GS-9 automatically
- **GS-7/9/11** → Hired at GS-7, promote to GS-11 automatically
- **GS-9/11/12** → VRA can get you in at GS-9, promote to GS-12 via career ladder

**Strategy:** Target career ladder positions where VRA gets you in, and the ladder takes you beyond GS-11.

## VRA vs. Other Veteran Hiring Authorities

### VRA vs. 30% or More Disabled

| Factor | VRA | 30% Disabled |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Disability required? | No (but extends eligibility) | Yes (30%+ rating) |
| Grade limit | GS-11 and below | No limit |
| Time limit | 3 years (unless disabled) | None |
| Conversion | 2 years to competitive | Can be permanent from start |

**Use VRA when:** You're within 3 years of separation OR have any disability rating, targeting GS-11 or below.

**Use 30% disabled when:** You have 30%+ rating and targeting positions above GS-11, or want immediate permanent appointment.

### VRA vs. VEOA

| Factor | VRA | VEOA |
|--------|-----|------|
| Type | Non-competitive | Competitive (merit) |
| Access | Any grade GS-11 or below | Merit promotion jobs |
| Competition | None | Against other VEOA/merit candidates |
| Best for | Getting hired quickly | Accessing internal positions |

### VRA vs. Veterans Preference

| Factor | VRA | Veterans Preference |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| Process | Non-competitive | Competitive with points |
| Points added | N/A | 5 or 10 points |
| Certainty | High (if selected) | Depends on competition |
| Grade limit | GS-11 and below | None |

## Maximizing Your VRA Eligibility

### If You're Still Serving

**Before separation:**
1. Ensure your service record qualifies you for campaign medals
2. Start VA disability claim process early
3. Obtain copies of all service documentation
4. Research agencies and positions of interest

### If You're Recently Separated

**Within 3 years:**
1. Use VRA actively—your window may be limited
2. Apply to multiple agencies simultaneously
3. Network with federal hiring managers
4. Consider contractor positions that lead to VRA conversion

### If You Have a Disability Rating

**Any rating:**
- Extends VRA eligibility indefinitely
- File VA claim even for minor service-connected issues
- 0% rating still counts for VRA extension

### Documentation Checklist

Keep these ready for VRA applications:
- [ ] DD-214 (Member 4 copy)
- [ ] VA disability rating letter (if applicable)
- [ ] Campaign medal documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Federal resume
- [ ] SF-15 (for 10-point preference backup)

## Common VRA Questions

### "Can I be hired above GS-11 via VRA?"

No. VRA is limited to GS-11 and below. For higher grades, use 30% disabled authority, VEOA, or competitive hiring.

### "Does VRA count toward retirement?"

Yes. VRA time counts for all purposes—retirement, leave accrual, time-in-service. You're a federal employee from day one.

### "What happens if I don't convert after 2 years?"

Non-conversion is rare and typically results from performance issues. If not converted:
- You may be terminated
- You may be placed in a different position
- Consult HR and employee resources if facing non-conversion

### "Can I use VRA multiple times?"

Generally, VRA is a one-time pathway into federal service. Once converted to competitive service, you no longer need VRA—you have full merit promotion eligibility.

### "Do I still get veterans preference in competitive jobs?"

Yes. VRA and veterans preference are separate authorities. You can claim veterans preference for competitive positions while also using VRA for non-competitive opportunities.

## The Bottom Line

VRA is one of the most powerful tools for veterans entering federal service:

**Key VRA advantages:**
- **Non-competitive:** No fighting for slots
- **Direct path:** Agency can hire you immediately
- **Career gateway:** Leads to full career status after 2 years
- **Wide availability:** Many agencies actively use VRA

**Key VRA limitations:**
- **GS-11 ceiling:** Not for senior positions
- **Time-limited:** 3 years unless disabled
- **Excepted service initially:** 2-year conversion required

**Your action steps:**
1. Verify your VRA eligibility (DD-214, disability letter)
2. Target agencies known to use VRA
3. Apply through USAJOBS AND direct agency contact
4. Network with federal veteran coordinators
5. Be ready to act when opportunities arise

VRA can get you into federal service faster than almost any other path. Use it.
