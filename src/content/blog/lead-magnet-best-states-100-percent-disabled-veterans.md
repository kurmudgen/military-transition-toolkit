## COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS

**Important:** State with highest property tax exemption isn't always cheapest overall.

**Example:**
- **New York:** $15,000 property tax exempted BUT groceries, housing, utilities very expensive
- **Tennessee:** $6,000 property tax exempted BUT overall cost of living 15-20% lower

**Always consider:**

Use cost of living calculators (Bankrate, NerdWallet) comparing your current location to target states.
