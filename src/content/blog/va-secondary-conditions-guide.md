# VA Secondary Conditions: Complete Guide to Increasing Your Rating (2025)

Secondary conditions are the key to maximizing your VA disability compensation. Most veterans stop after getting their initial conditions service-connected, leaving thousands of dollars on the table.

Here's the reality: A veteran rated 30% for a back condition could be at 70% or higher once secondary conditions (radiculopathy, depression, GERD from medications) are properly claimed.

This guide covers everything you need to know about secondary VA claims.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

A secondary condition is a disability that was **caused or aggravated** by an already service-connected condition.

### The Legal Standard

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, you can receive compensation for a disability that is:
- **Proximately due to** (caused by) a service-connected condition, OR
- **Aggravated by** (made worse by) a service-connected condition

### Examples

**Caused by:**
- Back condition (service-connected) → Radiculopathy (secondary)
- PTSD (service-connected) → Sleep problems → Sleep Apnea (secondary)
- Diabetes (service-connected) → Peripheral Neuropathy (secondary)

**Aggravated by:**
- Had mild pre-existing depression → Service-connected chronic pain made it much worse → Depression is secondary (aggravation)
- Had borderline hypertension → Service-connected PTSD elevated it to hypertension requiring medication → Hypertension secondary (aggravation)

## Why Secondary Claims Are So Valuable

### They're Easier Than Direct Claims

For secondary claims, you don't need to prove an in-service event or find decades-old records. You need:
1. Already service-connected primary condition
2. Current diagnosis of secondary condition
3. Medical nexus connecting them

### They Multiply Your Rating

One primary condition can generate multiple secondaries:

**Example: Back Condition (20%)**
- Right leg radiculopathy: +20%
- Left leg radiculopathy: +10%
- Depression from chronic pain: +30%
- GERD from NSAIDs: +10%
- **Combined: 64%** (from a single 20% back condition)

### They Have Strong Medical Support

Many secondary connections are well-documented in medical literature. Common connections are hard for the VA to deny.

## Most Common Secondary Claims

### From Orthopedic Conditions (Back, Knee, Shoulder, etc.)

## The Nexus Letter: Your Key Evidence

For secondary claims, the nexus letter explains the medical connection between your primary and secondary conditions.

### What a Good Nexus Letter Contains

1. **Provider credentials** (MD, DO, NP, PA)
2. **Review of your medical records**
3. **Current diagnosis** of secondary condition
4. **Clear opinion** using magic words: "at least as likely as not"
5. **Medical rationale** explaining HOW the primary condition caused the secondary
6. **Citation of medical literature** supporting the connection

### Example Nexus Statement

"It is my medical opinion that [Veteran]'s current diagnosis of major depressive disorder is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) caused by his service-connected chronic low back pain. Medical literature consistently demonstrates that chronic pain is a significant risk factor for depression, with studies showing that 30-50% of patients with chronic pain develop clinical depression. [Veteran]'s medical records document progressive mood deterioration correlating with his ongoing pain condition."

### Where to Get a Nexus Letter

**VA providers** - Free but may not want to write nexus letters
**Private physicians** - Your own doctor, $100-300
**Medical opinion services** - Companies specializing in veteran nexus letters, $500-1,500
**Independent Medical Examiners** - Board-certified specialists, $1,000-3,000

### Is a Nexus Letter Required?

Technically no—the C&P examiner can provide the nexus opinion. But if the examiner provides a negative opinion, having a private positive nexus gives you evidence for appeal.

**Strategy**: For well-established connections (PTSD → sleep apnea, diabetes → neuropathy), you may not need a private nexus. For less obvious connections, get one.

## How to File Secondary Claims

### Step 1: Identify Potential Secondaries

For each service-connected condition, ask:
- What problems has this condition caused?
- What medications do I take for it, and what are their side effects?
- How has it affected my mental health?
- Has it caused problems with other body parts?

### Step 2: Get Diagnosed

You need a current diagnosis of the secondary condition. See a doctor and get it documented.

### Step 3: Gather Evidence

- Medical records for secondary condition
- Nexus letter (if desired)
- Personal statement explaining connection
- Buddy statements if applicable

### Step 4: File the Claim

File VA Form 21-526EZ:
- List the secondary condition
- Check "secondary" as type
- Identify the primary condition it's secondary to
- Upload supporting evidence

### Step 5: Attend C&P Exam

The examiner will:
- Confirm the diagnosis
- Provide nexus opinion
- Assess severity

### Step 6: Wait for Decision

Processing time: 3-6 months typically

## Filing Strategy: All at Once vs. Sequentially

### All at Once (Pyramid Claim)

File all secondary conditions together with supporting evidence.

**Pros:**
- Faster overall
- One effective date for all
- Less administrative work

**Cons:**
- If one is denied, may delay others
- More complex claim

### Sequential Claims

File one secondary at a time, building on each approval.

**Pros:**
- Each claim is simpler
- Can learn from denials
- Build evidence for each

**Cons:**
- Takes longer overall
- Multiple effective dates
- More C&P exams

**Recommendation**: If you have strong evidence for all secondaries, file together. If some are weaker, consider filing strong ones first.

## Aggravation Claims

### What Is Aggravation?

If a condition existed before but got WORSE because of a service-connected condition, you can claim aggravation.

**Example**: You had mild anxiety before service-connected chronic pain. The pain made your anxiety significantly worse. You can claim anxiety as secondary to chronic pain (aggravation).

### How Aggravation Is Rated

The VA rates only the portion of disability attributable to the aggravation—not the pre-existing baseline.

**Example**:
- Pre-existing depression would warrant 10% rating
- After aggravation, total disability warrants 50%
- VA rates the aggravated portion: difference between current and baseline
- You might receive compensation at the 30% or 50% level depending on evaluation

### Proving Aggravation

You need evidence that:
1. Condition existed before
2. It got measurably worse
3. The worsening was caused by service-connected condition

Medical records showing progression after the primary condition worsened are key.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Filing Secondaries at All

Many veterans don't know about secondary claims or assume they're limited to their original conditions. Don't leave money on the table.

### 2. Filing Without Diagnosis

Get formally diagnosed before filing. "I think I have depression" isn't enough—you need it in your medical records.

### 3. No Clear Connection Documented

Don't assume the VA will figure out the connection. State it clearly in your claim and provide nexus evidence.

### 4. Waiting Too Long

You can file secondaries anytime, but earlier filing means earlier effective date and more back pay.

### 5. Not Considering Medication Side Effects

The medications for your service-connected conditions are causing problems. ED from SSRIs, GERD from NSAIDs, weight gain from psychiatric meds—all potentially secondary.

## The "Chain" Strategy

You can build chains of secondary conditions:

**Level 1**: PTSD (direct service connection)
**Level 2**: Sleep Apnea (secondary to PTSD)
**Level 3**: Hypertension (secondary to Sleep Apnea)
**Level 4**: Heart Disease (secondary to Hypertension)

Each level is secondary to the previous. This is how veterans build high combined ratings from a single primary condition.

## When to Get Professional Help

Consider hiring an accredited claims agent or attorney if:
- Your secondary claim has been denied
- You're unsure about the medical connection
- You need help with the nexus letter
- You're filing complex chains of secondaries
- You want to appeal a decision

VA-accredited representatives work on contingency (percentage of back pay) and can significantly improve outcomes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I file a secondary claim if my primary is rated 0%?
Yes. A 0% service-connected condition can still support secondary claims.

### How long after my primary rating can I file secondaries?
Anytime. There's no deadline for secondary claims.

### Does the secondary rating have to be lower than the primary?
No. Your secondary condition can be rated higher than your primary.

### Can I claim something secondary to a secondary?
Yes. This is the "chain" strategy. PTSD → Sleep Apnea → Hypertension is valid.

### What if the C&P examiner gives a negative nexus opinion?
Appeal with your own positive nexus letter from a private provider.

### Can I claim the same condition as both primary and secondary?
You only get one rating per condition. But you can try multiple paths to service connection.

## Bottom Line

Secondary conditions are how veterans maximize their disability compensation. For every service-connected condition you have, there are likely multiple secondaries you could claim.

Key steps:
1. Review all your service-connected conditions
2. Identify potential secondaries for each
3. Get diagnosed for those conditions
4. Obtain nexus letters for non-obvious connections
5. File claims systematically
6. Appeal denials with better evidence

Don't stop at your primary conditions. The VA will only compensate what you claim.
