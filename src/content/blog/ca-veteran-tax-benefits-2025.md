# California Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

California has historically been one of the toughest states for military retirees financially - but that's changing. In 2025, California introduced a partial military retirement tax exemption for the first time, joining the majority of states in recognizing veterans' service.

Here's what you need to know about California's veteran tax benefits, including the new military retirement exemption, property tax breaks for disabled veterans, and how these benefits stack up against the state's notoriously high cost of living.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what California offers veterans in 2025:

- **Military retirement pay**: NEW partial exemption up to $20,000 (starting 2025, expires 2029)
- **Property tax exemption**: Up to $262,950 in assessed value for 100% disabled veterans
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **CalVet home loans**: Competitive rates, zero down payment options
- **Cost of living**: 50% higher than national average (critical factor)

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $2,000-$15,000+ depending on property value and location.

**Reality check**: Even with these benefits, California remains one of the most expensive states for veterans. These benefits help, but they don't eliminate the cost gap.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - NEW Partial Exemption (2025-2029)

After years of being the only state to fully tax military retirement, California finally changed course in 2024.

**What's new for 2025**:
- Exclude up to $20,000 of military retirement pay from state income tax
- Applies to tax years 2025 through 2029 (5-year program)
- Income limits: $125,000 (single/head of household) or $250,000 (married filing jointly)

**How it works**:
- Military retirement under $20,000/year? It's all exempt
- Retire with $40,000/year? Exempt the first $20,000, pay tax on remaining $20,000
- Retire with $60,000/year? Exempt $20,000, pay tax on remaining $40,000

**The math**: At California's top rate of 13.3% (though most retirees pay 6-9.3%), exempting $20,000 saves approximately $1,200-$1,860 per year.

### Why This Matters

Before 2025, California was literally the only state that taxed 100% of military retirement as ordinary income. Every other state offered either full exemptions, partial exemptions, or had no income tax at all.

This new exemption doesn't make California competitive with tax-free states like Texas or Florida, but it's a step in the right direction.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation remains exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $171/month for a 10% rating or $3,946/month for 100% with dependents (2025 rates), you won't pay taxes on it.

### Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)

SBP payments received by surviving spouses qualify for the same $20,000 exemption as military retirement pay, subject to the same income limits.

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

California operates on a graduated income tax system with some of the nation's highest rates:

- 1% on taxable income up to $10,412 (single) or $20,824 (married)
- 2% on income between $10,412-$24,684 (single) or $20,824-$49,368 (married)
- 4% on income between $24,684-$38,959 (single) or $49,368-$77,918 (married)
- 6% on income between $38,959-$54,081 (single) or $77,918-$108,162 (married)
- 8% on income between $54,081-$68,350 (single) or $108,162-$136,700 (married)
- 9.3% on income between $68,350-$349,137 (single) or $136,700-$698,274 (married)
- 10.3% on income between $349,137-$418,961 (single) or $698,274-$837,922 (married)
- 11.3% on income between $418,961-$698,271 (single) or $837,922-$1,000,000 (married)
- 12.3% on income over $698,271 (single) or $1,000,000 (married)
- 13.3% additional 1% Mental Health Services Tax on income over $1,000,000

Most military retirees fall into the 6-9.3% brackets.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Top Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **California** | $20K exempt (2025-29) | 13.3% | Up to $262,950 value |
| Nevada | N/A | No income tax | Varies by county |
| Oregon | Full exemption | 9.9% | Varies |
| Arizona | Full exemption | 2.5% flat | Partial exemption |
| Texas | N/A | No income tax | Varies by county |

California's combination of limited military retirement exemption and high income tax rates makes it one of the least tax-friendly states for veterans, even with recent improvements.

## Property Tax Exemptions for Veterans

### 100% Disabled Veterans - Substantial Exemption

If you're rated 100% Permanent and Total (P&T) by the VA, you qualify for California's Disabled Veterans' Exemption.

**2025 exemption amounts**:
- **Basic exemption**: $175,298 in assessed value
- **Low-income exemption**: $262,950 in assessed value (if household income under $78,718)

**What this means**: The exemption reduces the assessed value of your home, which reduces your property tax bill.

#### How Property Tax Works in California

California's property tax system is built on Proposition 13:
- Base rate: 1% of assessed value
- Additional local assessments: Typically 0.1-0.3%
- Total effective rates: 0.72-1.25% depending on county

#### Real-World Examples

**San Diego County (0.72% effective rate)**
- Home value: $935,000
- Assessed value: $935,000
- Low-income exemption: $262,950
- Taxable value: $672,050
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $6,732
- **Annual tax with exemption**: $4,839
- **Annual savings: $1,893**

**Los Angeles County (0.82% effective rate)**
- Home value: $850,000
- Assessed value: $850,000
- Low-income exemption: $262,950
- Taxable value: $587,050
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $6,970
- **Annual tax with exemption**: $4,814
- **Annual savings: $2,156**

**Riverside County (typical rate ~1.0%)**
- Home value: $625,000
- Assessed value: $625,000
- Low-income exemption: $262,950
- Taxable value: $362,050
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $6,250
- **Annual tax with exemption**: $3,621
- **Annual savings: $2,629**

**Sacramento County (0.77% effective rate)**
- Home value: $550,000
- Assessed value: $550,000
- Low-income exemption: $262,950
- Taxable value: $287,050
- **Annual tax without exemption**: $4,235
- **Annual tax with exemption**: $2,210
- **Annual savings: $2,025**

### Income Limits for Enhanced Exemption

To qualify for the $262,950 low-income exemption (versus the $175,298 basic exemption), your total household income from all sources for the prior year must not exceed $78,718 (2025 limit).

**Income includes**:
- Military retirement pay (before exemptions)
- VA disability compensation
- Social Security benefits
- Wages from employment
- Investment income
- All other income sources

**Important**: Many disabled veterans will exceed this income limit, which limits them to the $175,298 basic exemption.

### Partial Disability Ratings

Unlike some states, California doesn't offer graduated property tax exemptions for veterans with disability ratings below 100%. The exemption is specifically for veterans rated 100% disabled or receiving 100% compensation due to individual unemployability.

## Vehicle Registration Benefits

### Disabled Veteran License Plates

California offers specialized license plates for disabled veterans, but unlike some states, these don't provide registration fee exemptions.

**Disabled Veteran plates**:
- Available to veterans with service-connected disabilities
- Annual fee: $47 (same as regular plates)
- Purple Heart plates also available
- Medal of Honor recipients get free registration

**The reality**: California doesn't offer the vehicle registration fee exemptions that many other states provide for disabled veterans. This is one area where the state lags behind.

## CalVet Home Loan Program

While not a tax benefit, California's CalVet home loan program provides significant financial value.

**Key benefits**:
- Competitive interest rates (often 0.25-0.35% below market)
- Zero down payment options
- No monthly PMI
- 1% origination fee
- Loan limits: $806,500 standard, up to $1,209,750 in high-cost counties
- Includes disaster and life insurance

**2025 rates**: Approximately 5.125% (versus 5.375-5.5% conventional)

**Example savings**:
- $600,000 loan at 5.125% vs. 5.5%
- Monthly payment: $3,265 vs. $3,407
- **Monthly savings: $142**
- **30-year savings: $51,120**

**Eligibility**:
- 90+ days active duty
- Honorable discharge
- Purchasing or refinancing in California
- No current CalVet loan

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran in California.

### Scenario: E-8 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $36,000
- VA disability: $47,300 (100% with dependents)
- Total: $83,300

**Home**: $700,000 (below median for many CA metros)

### California Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax exemption (low-income) | $5,110 | $102,200 |
| Military retirement tax exemption | $1,860 | $37,200 |
| CalVet loan (vs conventional) | $1,704 | $34,080 |
| **TOTAL** | **$8,674** | **$173,480** |

**Note**: This assumes:
- 0.73% effective property tax rate (state average)
- 9.3% state income tax bracket
- CalVet loan savings over 30 years (only 20 years counted)
- No increase in exemption amounts (they're indexed to inflation)

### The Cost of Living Reality Check

While $173,480 in savings over 20 years sounds substantial, let's compare California to a veteran-friendly state like Texas or Florida.

**Same scenario in Texas** (no income tax, lower property taxes, 60% lower housing costs):
- Home price: $280,000 (vs. $700,000)
- Property tax: ~$5,600/year (higher rate but lower value)
- Income tax: $0
- 20-year cost difference: ~$150,000-$250,000 saved

**The bottom line**: Even with veteran benefits, California's high cost of living means you'll likely spend significantly more over 20 years compared to lower-cost states.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the $20,000 military retirement exemption be extended beyond 2029?

Unknown. The exemption is currently authorized for tax years 2025-2029 only. Veterans' advocacy groups are pushing to make it permanent and increase the amount, but there's no guarantee. The state's budget situation will likely determine whether it's extended.

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?

It depends:
- **Basic exemption ($175,298)**: No, one-time filing
- **Low-income exemption ($262,950)**: Yes, must verify income eligibility annually

### What if I'm rated 90% or lower?

California's disabled veterans' property tax exemption only applies to 100% disabled ratings. If you're at 90%, you don't qualify even though you're severely disabled. This is one of California's least generous aspects compared to states that offer graduated exemptions.

### Can I get the property tax exemption on a second home or rental property?

No. The exemption applies only to your principal place of residence.

### What counts as "100% disabled" for the property tax exemption?

Either of these qualifies:
- 100% Permanent & Total (P&T) rating
- 100% schedular rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU)

### I'm rated 100% P&T but my household income is $90,000. Which exemption do I get?

You'd receive the basic exemption ($175,298) since your income exceeds the $78,718 limit for the low-income exemption. You still save money, just less than lower-income veterans.

### Does the property tax exemption reduce my home's market value?

No. It only reduces the assessed value for tax purposes. Your home's actual market value and your equity remain unchanged.

### What if my county denies my exemption application?

You have the right to appeal:
1. Request a written explanation from your county assessor
2. File an appeal with the county assessment appeals board
3. Contact CalVet for assistance: (800) 952-5626
4. Contact your county veterans service officer (CVSO)

Each county has a CVSO who can help navigate the process.

### Are CalVet home loans better than VA loans?

It depends:

**CalVet advantages**:
- Often lower rates (0.25-0.35% below market)
- Includes disaster and life insurance
- No minimum credit score

**VA loan advantages**:
- Available nationwide
- More lender options
- Slightly more flexible on property types

**Bottom line**: If buying in California, compare both. Many veterans find CalVet offers better terms.

### Can I use both the military retirement exemption and the property tax exemption?

Yes! These are separate benefits. If you're retired military AND 100% disabled, you get both.

### Will these benefits affect my federal taxes?

No. State tax benefits don't impact your federal tax liability. VA disability compensation and the untaxed portion of military retirement remain tax-free federally.

### Does California tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, fully, at the normal income tax rates (up to 13.3%). California doesn't offer special treatment for retirement account withdrawals like some states do.

### I'm stationed in California but claim residency in another state. Can I get these benefits?

No. These are California resident benefits only. If you maintain legal residency in another state (which many active-duty service members do to avoid California taxes), you won't qualify for California veteran benefits.

### What if I move to California after retiring from the military?

You can claim the military retirement exemption starting with your first full year as a California resident. The property tax exemption becomes available once you establish residency and own property.

## Cost of Living Considerations

Before moving to California for veteran benefits, understand the cost reality.

### Housing Costs (Median Home Prices, 2025)

- **San Diego**: $935,000
- **Los Angeles**: $850,000
- **Orange County**: $1,100,000+
- **San Francisco Bay Area**: $1,300,000+
- **Sacramento**: $550,000
- **Riverside**: $625,000
- **Fresno**: $387,500
- **Bakersfield**: $375,000

### Overall Cost of Living

California's cost of living is 50% higher than the national average:
- **Housing**: 116% above national average
- **Utilities**: 21% above national average
- **Transportation**: 23% above national average
- **Groceries**: 11% above national average
- **Healthcare**: 7% above national average

### Tax Burden Beyond Income Tax

- **Sales tax**: 7.25% state rate, up to 10.75% with local taxes (highest in nation)
- **Gas tax**: $0.68 per gallon (highest in nation)
- **Vehicle registration**: $200-$600+ annually based on value

### Where California Veteran Benefits Make the Most Sense

**You might benefit from California if**:
- You have strong family ties in California
- Your civilian job pays significantly more in California than elsewhere
- You qualify for the low-income property tax exemption
- You're buying in lower-cost areas (Central Valley, Inland Empire)
- You need access to world-class VA medical centers

**You might be better off elsewhere if**:
- Maximizing retirement income is your priority
- You're on a fixed income
- You're flexible on location
- You want to maximize savings over 20-30 years

## Key Takeaways

1. **California finally offers some military retirement relief** - The $20,000 exemption saves $1,200-$1,860 annually, but it's temporary (2025-2029)

2. **Property tax exemption provides real value** - Save $2,000-$5,000+ annually depending on home value and county

3. **California remains expensive** - Even with veteran benefits, expect to pay 40-60% more than national average for cost of living

4. **Benefits are progressive** - Lower-income veterans get better property tax exemptions; higher earners may not qualify for some benefits

5. **The math matters** - Run the numbers for your specific situation before committing to California versus lower-cost states

6. **Apply immediately** - Don't leave money on the table. If you qualify for the property tax exemption, file as soon as you get your rating
