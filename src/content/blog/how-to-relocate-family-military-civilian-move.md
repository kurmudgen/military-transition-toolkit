# How to Relocate Your Family: Military to Civilian Move Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Military moving was easy: orders + movers + housing assigned.** Civilian moving is on you. **Timeline: 3-6 months to find housing, 1-2 months to actually move, 3-6 months for family to adjust.** Cost: $5,000-$20,000 depending on distance and needs. **Key: Plan early, communicate with family, help everyone adjust.**

## The Military vs. Civilian Move

### Military Move
- Orders provided housing location
- Military movers packed/transported
- Housing was assigned or you got housing allowance
- Most logistics handled by military
- Family didn't decide location
- Cost: Free (military covered)

### Civilian Move
- YOU decide location
- YOU arrange movers (or do it yourself)
- YOU find housing (apartment or house)
- YOU handle all logistics
- Family can have input
- Cost: $3,000-$20,000 out of pocket

**This is a LOT more responsibility.**

## Step-by-Step Relocation Plan

### Phase 1: Decide Where to Move (Month 1-2)

**Factors to consider:**
- Where is your new job?
- Cost of living in that area
- Schools (if kids)
- Community/culture fit
- Proximity to family/support
- Housing market
- Job market for spouse (if applicable)

**Research:**
- [ ] Look at job locations (are you flexible?)
- [ ] Research cost of living (how far does your paycheck go?)
- [ ] Research schools (if kids)
- [ ] Visit if possible (get feel for area)
- [ ] Talk to people living there
- [ ] Check local Facebook groups

**Decision:**
- [ ] Decide location by end of month 2
- [ ] Commit to the location (mentally, emotionally)

### Phase 2: Find Housing (Month 2-4)

**Options:**

**1. Apartment**
- Cost: $1,200-$2,500/month (varies wildly by location)
- Pros: Short-term commitment, furnished often, move-in quick
- Cons: Limited space, noise, no yard, renters don't love kids/pets
- Timeline: Can find and move into in 2-4 weeks

**2. House Rental**
- Cost: $1,500-$3,500/month (varies)
- Pros: More space, yard, stability
- Cons: Longer lease (usually 1 year), harder to find with pets/kids
- Timeline: 1-2 months to find

**3. House Purchase**
- Cost: 20% down payment (maybe $40-100K+), mortgage (depends on price)
- Pros: Long-term stability, yours to modify, builds equity
- Cons: Slow process (2-3 months), expensive, requires mortgage approval, harder to leave if job changes
- Timeline: 2-4 months total

**My recommendation for transition:** Rent for first year while you figure things out. Buying is commitment you might regret if new job is bad.

**Housing search:**
- [ ] Use Zillow, Apartments.com, Craigslist for listings
- [ ] Google Maps street view (virtual tour)
- [ ] Check crime rates (NeighborhoodScout.com)
- [ ] Visit in person if possible (gut feel matters)
- [ ] Ask locals about neighborhoods
- [ ] Visit potential schools
- [ ] Check commute time to job

**Timeline:** Should have housing picked by end of month 4

### Phase 3: Plan the Move (Month 4-5)

**Movers:**
- [ ] Get quotes from 3+ moving companies
- [ ] Compare costs and services
- [ ] Check reviews
- [ ] Book movers by month 4 (they book up)

**Cost:** $3,000-$10,000 depending on distance and amount of stuff

**Alternatives to full-service movers:**
- DIY rental truck ($1,000-$2,000): You pack, move, unpack
- Hybrid: Movers pack/load, you drive truck
- POD (Pods.com): They drop container, you pack, they pick up ($2,000-$5,000)

**What to move:**
- [ ] Inventory what you're moving
- [ ] Sell/donate things you don't need (reduces moving cost)
- [ ] Consider leaving military-specific furniture (probably doesn't fit civilian home)

**Moving timeline:**
- Month 4: Get quotes, book movers
- Month 5: Start packing, arrange logistics
- Week of move: Final logistics, confirm everything
- Move day: Execute

### Phase 4: Execute Move and Settle (Month 5-6)

**Move week:**
- [ ] Confirm movers arrival date/time
- [ ] Have new home access ready (keys, lease signed)
- [ ] Arrange utilities (electricity, water, internet)
- [ ] Change address (USPS, utilities, insurance, etc.)
- [ ] Final walkthrough at old place
- [ ] Moving day: Supervise movers
- [ ] Unpack essentials first (bedding, kitchen, bathroom)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Phase 5: Family Adjustment (Months 6-12)

**During first month:**
- Kids meet neighbors, explore neighborhood
- Set up school stuff (if applicable)
- Find routines (church, gym, grocery store, etc.)
- Explore community
- Slow process—give it time

**Months 1-3:**
- Kids get settled in school
- You make initial friends/connections
- Community becomes familiar
- Still adjusting

**Months 3-6:**

- Made some friends

- Routines established

**Months 6-12:**
- Feel like you live here (not visiting)
- Kids have friend groups
- You have community/connections
- Feels normal

**Real timeline:** Most families feel settled by month 6-8

## Help Your Family Adjust

**What kids worry about:**
- "Will I have friends?"
- "What if I don't like the new school?"
- "Will I miss my friends?"
- "What if the house is ugly?"
- "What's wrong with moving?"

**What to say:**
- "You'll make new friends. It takes time."
- "Let's stay in touch with your current friends."
- "The new place will feel like home soon."
- "Our family is together, that's what matters."
- "Change is hard, and you're brave."

### First Week at New Location

- [ ] Don't overschedule (give them time to adjust)

### School Transition (If applicable)

### Spouse/Family Adjustment

**For your spouse:**
