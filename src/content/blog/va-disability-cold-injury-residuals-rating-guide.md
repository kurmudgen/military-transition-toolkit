# VA Disability Rating for Cold Injury Residuals: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Cold injury residuals (frostbite, trench foot, immersion foot) are rated under **Diagnostic Code 7122** with ratings from **10% to 30%** per affected extremity. **Each affected area is rated separately**, so veterans with multiple limbs affected can receive significant combined ratings. Cold injuries are common among **Korean War veterans**, **Alaska/cold weather veterans**, and **infantry personnel** who served in harsh winter conditions. The key evidence is documentation of cold exposure during service and current residual symptoms like **cold sensitivity**, **numbness**, and **pain**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Cold Injury Residuals?

Cold injury residuals are the long-term effects of frostbite, trench foot, or other cold-related injuries sustained during military service.

**Types of Cold Injuries:**
- **Frostbite**: Freezing of tissues, most common in fingers, toes, ears, nose
- **Trench Foot/Immersion Foot**: Prolonged exposure to cold, wet conditions
- **Chilblains**: Repeated exposure to cold (not freezing) temperatures
- **Hypothermia**: Core body temperature drop (can cause lasting effects)

**Common Residual Symptoms:**
- Cold sensitivity (affected areas feel cold easily)
- Numbness or reduced sensation
- Pain (especially in cold weather)
- Color changes (pale, red, blue)
- Nail abnormalities
- Tissue loss (severe cases)
- Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
- Arthritis in affected joints

**Military Connections:**

### Common Exposure Scenarios
- **Korean War**: Chosin Reservoir, winter campaigns
- **Alaska/Arctic duty**: Extreme cold weather training
- **Mountain warfare training**: High altitude, cold exposure
- **Infantry operations**: Extended field duty in winter
- **Guard duty**: Prolonged standing in cold conditions
- **European winter campaigns**: WWII, Cold War
- **High altitude training**: Parachute, mountain units

## VA Rating Criteria

Cold injury residuals are rated under **38 CFR § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7122**:

### Per Affected Part (Hand, Foot, Ear, Nose)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Arthralgia or other pain, numbness, or cold sensitivity |
| **20%** | Arthralgia or other pain, numbness, or cold sensitivity PLUS tissue loss, nail abnormalities, color changes, locally impaired sensation, hyperhidrosis, or X-ray abnormalities (osteoporosis, subarticular punched out lesions, or osteoarthritis) |
| **30%** | Arthralgia or other pain, numbness, or cold sensitivity PLUS two or more of the following: tissue loss, nail abnormalities, color changes, locally impaired sensation, hyperhidrosis, or X-ray abnormalities |

### Key Points

- **Each affected part is rated separately** (right foot, left foot, right hand, left hand, each ear, nose)
- **Amputations are rated separately** under amputation codes, not DC 7122
- **Minimum 10%** if you have pain, numbness, OR cold sensitivity

### Example Ratings

**Bilateral Frostbite (Both Feet):**
- Right foot with cold sensitivity, numbness, and color changes: 20%
- Left foot with cold sensitivity, numbness, and color changes: 20%
- Combined rating would be calculated using VA math

**Four Extremities Affected:**
- Right hand: 10%
- Left hand: 10%
- Right foot: 20%
- Left foot: 20%
- Results in significant combined rating

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records documenting cold injury
- Service in cold weather location/assignment
- Unit history showing cold weather operations
- Buddy statements about cold exposure
- Personnel records showing duty stations

**For Korean War Veterans:**
- Service during Korean War winters (especially 1950-1951)
- Assignment to units involved in Chosin Reservoir or winter campaigns
- Often limited medical records—buddy statements and unit histories help

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Examination documenting cold injury residuals
- X-rays of affected extremities
- Documentation of specific symptoms:
  - Cold sensitivity
  - Numbness
  - Pain
  - Color changes
  - Nail abnormalities
  - Tissue loss

### Severity Evidence
- Detailed symptom documentation
- X-ray findings (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis)
- Functional limitations
- Treatment records

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review cold exposure history
2. Examine all affected areas
3. Document symptoms present
4. Order or review X-rays
5. Assess each qualifying symptom
6. Rate each affected part separately

**What to tell them:**
- When and where cold injury occurred
- All affected body parts (don't forget ears, nose)
- Cold sensitivity (describe how cold affects you)
- Numbness or reduced sensation
- Pain (especially in cold weather)
- Any color changes
- Nail problems
- How symptoms affect daily life

**Important Tips:**
- **List all affected areas**: Frostbite often affects multiple extremities
- **Describe cold sensitivity**: "My feet hurt when it's below 50 degrees," etc.
- **Mention year-round symptoms**: Not just winter problems

## Secondary Conditions

**Cold injury residuals can cause:**
- **Peripheral neuropathy** in affected areas
- **Arthritis** in affected joints
- **Raynaud's syndrome** (secondary vascular problems)
- **Depression** (chronic pain, limitation)
- **Gait abnormalities** (if feet affected) leading to knee/hip/back problems

**Important:** Some of these may be rated as part of cold injury residuals or separately—depends on medical evidence.

## Personal Statement Template

**Personal Statement for Cold Injury Residuals**

I, [Full Name], submit this statement for cold injury residuals affecting my [list all affected body parts].

**Service Connection:**
I sustained cold injuries during my military service:

**Location/Dates:** [Where and when—e.g., Korea December 1950, Ft. Drum winter training 1995]

**Circumstances:**
[Describe the cold exposure event(s):]
- Duration of exposure
- Conditions (temperature, wet/dry, wind)
- What you were doing
- Any immediate symptoms
- Treatment received (if any)

**Example:** "During the Chosin Reservoir campaign in December 1950, our unit was exposed to temperatures reaching -35°F for over two weeks. I developed frostbite on both feet and hands. My feet turned white and then black on the toes. Medical treatment was limited to warming and bandaging."

**Affected Body Parts:**

**Cold Sensitivity:**
My [affected parts] become painful and cold when the temperature drops below [X] degrees. I must [wear extra layers, avoid going outside, use hand warmers, etc.].

**Numbness:**
I have [constant/intermittent] numbness in [specific areas]. This affects my ability to [feel textures, manipulate objects, walk on uneven ground, etc.].

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is each body part rated separately?
**Yes.** Each affected hand, foot, ear, or nose receives its own rating. This is one of the few conditions where the VA explicitly rates multiple body parts separately.

### What if I don't have medical records from the cold injury?
Buddy statements, unit histories, and service records showing assignment to cold weather locations can help establish exposure. Korean War veterans especially often have limited medical documentation.

### Do I need X-rays?
X-rays showing osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, or other abnormalities support a higher rating (20% or 30% vs. 10%). Get X-rays of affected extremities before filing.

### What is "cold sensitivity"?
Affected areas are hypersensitive to cold—feeling cold, painful, or numb at temperatures that don't bother unaffected areas. Document the specific temperature threshold that triggers symptoms.

### Can I claim secondary conditions?
Yes. Peripheral neuropathy, arthritis, Raynaud's, and other conditions caused by cold injury can be claimed as secondary.

### What if my frostbite was minor during service but causes problems now?
Cold injuries often cause progressive damage over decades. Even "minor" frostbite can result in significant residuals. Document your current symptoms.

### Are there presumptive conditions for cold injury?
Cold injury itself is not presumptive, but the VA recognizes that documented cold exposure leads to predictable long-term residuals. The key is documenting the original exposure.
