# North Dakota Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

North Dakota offers excellent tax benefits for veterans, with **military retirement pay 100% exempt from state income tax** (saving $800-$2,000+ annually) and a **disability-based property tax credit** that matches your VA rating percentage. A 100% disabled veteran gets a full 100% property tax credit on the first $120,000 of home value—worth $1,200-$2,200 annually depending on county.

North Dakota ranks in the **top 15 states nationally** for veteran tax benefits. The combination of no tax on military retirement, low state income tax rates (0-2.5%), moderate property taxes (0.99% average effective rate), and a 5% sales tax creates significant savings. A 100% disabled veteran with $40,000 military retirement saves approximately $2,500-$3,500 annually compared to higher-tax neighboring states.

The property tax credit structure is fair: veterans with 50% or higher service-connected disability get a credit equal to their rating percentage (50% rating = 50% credit, 75% rating = 75% credit, 100% rating = 100% credit). The credit applies to the first $120,000 of true and full valuation of your homestead. Unlike many states that cap benefits at specific dollar amounts, North Dakota's percentage-based system scales with your disability.

Downsides? Property taxes are moderate but not the lowest nationally (average $2,746 annually on median home). The 5% sales tax isn't as favorable as states with no sales tax. If you're under 50% disabled, you won't qualify for the property tax credit. North Dakota also has **brutal winters** (average January temperatures 5-17°F), which may impact quality of life for some veterans.

Overall verdict: North Dakota is excellent for military retirees and disabled veterans (50%+), ranking among the best Midwest states. The no-tax on military retirement is the biggest benefit. If you're under 50% disabled, benefits are solid but not exceptional—you'll still benefit from the retirement pay exemption and low income tax rates.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Credit: **100% of property tax** on first $120,000 true and full value
- Requirements: 100% service-connected disability from VA; honorable discharge
- Annual savings: $1,200-$2,200+ depending on county
- Also qualifies: Veterans with extra-schedular TDIU rating bringing total to 100%

If you're rated 100% service-connected by the VA, you get a **100% property tax credit** on the first $120,000 of your home's true and full valuation. In North Dakota, assessed value is 50% of market value, so this effectively covers up to a $240,000 market value home.

**Example:** A $250,000 home in Cass County (Fargo):
- True and full value: $250,000
- Assessed value (50%): $125,000
- Effective tax rate: 1.87%
- Annual tax on $125,000 assessed: $2,338
- 100% credit applies to first $120,000 true value = $60,000 assessed
- Tax on $60,000 at 1.87%: $1,122
- **Annual savings with 100% credit: $1,122**

**75% Disabled Veterans:**
- Credit: **75% of property tax** on first $120,000 true and full value
- Annual savings: $900-$1,650 depending on county

**50-99% Disabled Veterans:**
- Credit: **Percentage matching your rating** on first $120,000 true and full value
- 50% rating = 50% credit
- 60% rating = 60% credit
- 70% rating = 70% credit
- Annual savings: $600-$2,000+ depending on rating and county

**Paraplegic Veterans / Specially Adapted Housing:**
- Credit: **100% property tax exemption** on first $120,000 true and full value
- Requirements: Paraplegic veteran OR received specially adapted housing from VA
- No disability rating minimum required for specially adapted housing recipients

**Under 50% Disabled Veterans / General Veterans:**
- No property tax credit available
- Must pay full property tax

North Dakota's disability-based system is fair and scales with your impairment level. Unlike states with one-size-fits-all credits, your benefit matches your VA rating percentage.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local county auditor** (Cass County for Fargo, Burleigh County for Bismarck, etc.)

2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4) showing honorable discharge
   - VA award letter certifying service-connected disability percentage
   - Proof of North Dakota residency
   - Property deed or tax statement

3. **File affidavit with county auditor**
   - Deadline: **March 31** of the assessment year for which credit is requested
   - Processing: 30-60 days
   - Effective: Current tax year if filed by deadline

**Important:** File by March 31 or you'll wait until the following year. Missing the deadline costs you 12 months of savings ($1,000+ for highly disabled veterans).

### Property Tax by County

North Dakota has a 0.99% average effective property tax rate (26th lowest nationally), with an average annual bill of $2,746 on the median home value of $280,600.

| County | Major City | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | 100% Disabled Savings |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Cass | Fargo | $390,000 | 1.87% | $3,649 | $1,122+ |
| Burleigh | Bismarck | $341,000 | 0.88% | $1,501 | $528+ |
| Grand Forks | Grand Forks | $280,000 | 1.35% | $1,890 | $810+ |
| Ward | Minot | $365,000 | 1.07% | $1,953 | $643+ |
| Stark | Dickinson | $310,000 | 1.15% | $1,783 | $690+ |
| Morton | Mandan | $320,000 | 1.05% | $1,680 | $630+ |

**Example Calculation (Cass County - Fargo):**
- $390,000 home, true and full value = $390,000
- Assessed value (50% of true and full) = $195,000
- Property tax at 1.87% on $195,000 = $3,649
- 100% credit applies to first $120,000 true value ($60,000 assessed)
- Tax on $60,000 at 1.87% = $1,122
- **Savings with 100% disabled credit: $1,122**
- **Remaining tax: $2,527**

Over 20 years, a 100% disabled veteran in Fargo saves **$22,440** compared to a non-disabled homeowner.

### Surviving Spouse Benefits

**Unremarried Surviving Spouse:**
- Eligible for: 100% property tax credit (same as deceased veteran had)
- Requirements: Veteran qualified for credit; spouse has not remarried; receives VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)
- Duration: As long as spouse remains unremarried

If your spouse was a qualifying disabled veteran, you retain the **full 100% credit** after their death, as long as you don't remarry and you're receiving DIC from the VA. This is one of the better surviving spouse benefits nationally—many states terminate credits upon the veteran's death.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—100% exempt from North Dakota income tax**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $800-$2,000+ compared to states that tax military retirement

North Dakota fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax for all branches (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force) and components (active duty retirees, Reserve, National Guard). This applies to retired pay, retainer pay, and equivalent payments.

**Example savings:**
- E-8 retiree with $35,000 pension:
  - In Minnesota (top rate 5.35%): $1,873 state tax
  - In North Dakota: $0
  - **Annual savings: $1,873**

- O-5 retiree with $55,000 pension:
  - In Montana (top rate 5.9%): $3,245 state tax
  - In North Dakota: $0
  - **Annual savings: $3,245**

- E-7 retiree with $30,000 pension:
  - In South Dakota: $0 (no income tax)
  - In North Dakota: $0
  - **No difference** (both states exempt)

**How to claim:** When filing your North Dakota state tax return, subtract the full amount of military retirement benefits reported on your federal Form 1099-R. Attach a copy of your 1099-R from Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to your state return.

**For tax years 2019 and after:** Military retirement benefit payments received by retired U.S. Armed Forces, Reserve, and National Guard members, or their surviving spouses, may be subtracted from North Dakota taxable income. The deduction equals the taxable amount of benefits reported on your federal return.

### North Dakota Income Tax Rates (2025)

North Dakota has **three tax brackets** with rates from 0% to 2.5% (among the lowest state income tax rates in America):

**Single Filers:**
- $0 – $55,975: **0%** (no state income tax)
- $55,975 – $252,325: **1.95%**
- Over $252,325: **2.5%**

**Married Filing Jointly:**
- $0 – $55,488: **0%** (no state income tax)
- $55,488 – $164,038: **1.95%**
- Over $164,038: **2.5%**

**Standard deduction:** $15,000 (single), $30,000 (married filing jointly)

**What this means for veterans:**
- If your total income (excluding military retirement) is under $55,975 (single) or $55,488 (joint), you pay **zero North Dakota state income tax**
- Even at higher incomes, the maximum rate is only 2.5%—far lower than Minnesota (5.35%), Montana (5.9%), or most other states

**Example:** A married couple, both veterans, with $50,000 military retirement (exempt) + $40,000 civilian income:
- Taxable income: $40,000 (retirement is exempt)
- After $30,000 standard deduction: $10,000 taxable
- Tax owed: **$0** (under $55,488 threshold)

This is one of North Dakota's best features for military retirees—you can have substantial income and still pay zero or minimal state income tax.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: **100% exempt** federally and in all states
- North Dakota: Not taxed

All VA disability compensation is federally tax-exempt and not subject to any state income taxes. North Dakota honors this exemption.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- North Dakota taxation: **Taxed at regular income tax rates** (0-2.5%)
- Federal: Taxed federally
- **Note:** Military retirement pay is exempt for surviving spouses, but SBP payments from DFAS are treated as regular pension income

Surviving spouses receiving Survivor Benefit Plan payments do pay North Dakota income tax on SBP, though the low rates (0-2.5%) minimize the impact. However, if the surviving spouse receives military retirement pay directly (not SBP), that retirement pay is fully exempt.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Subject to North Dakota income tax at regular rates (0-2.5%)
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; not taxed by North Dakota
- **Active duty pay:** Taxed by North Dakota if you're a resident; exempt under SCRA if you maintain out-of-state residency

**SCRA Protection:** If you're active duty stationed in North Dakota but your home of record is another state, you're protected under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act—you only pay income tax to your home state, not North Dakota.

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled American Veteran (DAV) License Plates:**
- Eligibility: **100% service-connected disabled veterans**
- Cost: **Free registration and license fees** (waived annually)
- Vehicle excise tax: **Exempt** on up to **two vehicles**
- Parking: Plates allow parking in **handicap parking spaces** (no additional placard required)
- Annual savings: $100-$200 per vehicle (registration + excise tax)

North Dakota's DAV plates provide three major benefits:
1. **No annual license fees**
2. **No vehicle excise tax** (5% sales tax on vehicle purchases)
3. **Handicap parking privileges**

**How to apply:** Apply at North Dakota Department of Transportation. Provide:
- DD Form 214
- VA letter certifying 100% service-connected disability
- Vehicle title and registration

**Excise Tax Exemption Example:**
- Buying a $40,000 truck: 5% excise tax = $2,000
- With DAV plates: $0
- **Savings: $2,000 per vehicle** (up to two vehicles)

**Surviving Spouse:** An unremarried surviving spouse may retain **one DAV plate** for their own use.

**Weight Restriction:** Vehicles with gross weight of 26,000 lbs or more are excluded from DAV plates.

**Driver's License Fee:** No specific driver's license fee exemption for disabled veterans in North Dakota, though DAV plate holders don't pay vehicle registration fees.

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **5%** (state rate)
- Local sales tax: Up to **3.5%** (varies by city/county)
- Combined rate: **5-8.5%** depending on location
- Veteran exemption: **None** (except vehicle excise tax for DAV plate holders)

North Dakota has a 5% state sales tax, which is moderate compared to other states (national median is ~6%). Unlike states like Montana, Oregon, or New Hampshire with no sales tax, North Dakota veterans pay the standard rate on most purchases.

**Major city combined rates:**
- Fargo: 7.5% (5% state + 2.5% local)
- Bismarck: 7% (5% state + 2% local)
- Grand Forks: 7.5%
- Minot: 7.5%

**Vehicle Excise Tax Exemption:** The one major sales tax benefit is for 100% disabled veterans with DAV plates—they're **exempt from the 5% vehicle excise tax** on up to two vehicles. This saves $2,000 on a $40,000 vehicle purchase.

**No general sales tax exemption** exists for groceries, clothing, household goods, or other purchases. Veterans pay the standard 5-8.5% combined rate.

## Overall Tax Analysis

- Property tax saved: $1,122
- Military retirement exemption saved (vs. Minnesota): $2,140
- Vehicle excise tax saved (one-time on $40,000 vehicle): $2,000 amortized = $200/year
- Sales tax paid: -$800 (estimated on $16,000 annual purchases)
- **Total annual savings vs. Minnesota: $2,662**
- **Total annual savings vs. non-exempt ND resident: $1,322**

**75% Disabled, Military Retiree ($35,000 retirement):**

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled Veteran:**
- Annual savings (vs. MN): $2,662
- 20-year total: $53,240
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $39,700

**75% Disabled:**
- Annual savings: $2,714
- 20-year total: $54,280
- NPV: $40,470

**50% Disabled:**
- Annual savings: $2,166
- 20-year total: $43,320
- NPV: $32,280

**Military Retiree (No Disability):**
- Annual savings: $2,140
- 20-year total: $42,800
- NPV: $31,900

Over 20 years, even a non-disabled military retiree saves over $40,000 compared to states that tax military retirement. Disabled veterans save $50,000-$55,000, with 100% disabled saving the most due to full property tax credit.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Exemption | Sales Tax | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $40K Retirement, $390K Home) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **North Dakota** | Exempt | 100% credit on $120K value ($1,122 saved) | 5% | Baseline |
| South Dakota | Exempt (no income tax) | $0 exemption (no property tax credit) | 4.5% | -$1,122 (worse property tax) |
| Minnesota | Taxed | $0 exemption (minimal property credit) | 6.875% | -$2,662 (worse overall) |
| Montana | Partially exempt (up to $5,450) | $0 exemption | 0% | -$375 (slightly worse) |
| Wyoming | Exempt (no income tax) | $0 exemption | 4% | -$622 (slightly worse property) |

**Verdict:** North Dakota ranks **#2** among neighboring states for 100% disabled veterans (South Dakota's no income tax is better, but lack of property tax credit hurts). North Dakota is **#1** for 50-99% disabled veterans due to the scalable property tax credit. For non-disabled military retirees, South Dakota or Wyoming edge ahead due to no state income tax.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Military retirement exemption:** **Top tier**—full exemption saves $800-$2,000+ annually
- **Property tax credit:** **Above average**—percentage-based credit matching disability rating is fairer than fixed-dollar exemptions
- **Income tax rates:** **Excellent**—0-2.5% ranks among lowest in America
- **Sales tax:** **Moderate**—5% is neither great nor terrible
- **Overall ranking:** **Top 15 nationally** for disabled veterans and military retirees

Studies consistently rank North Dakota in the **top 15-20 states** for military retirees and disabled veterans. The military retirement exemption and low income tax rates are the biggest draws. Property tax credit is solid but not as generous as states like Texas, Oklahoma, or Florida with higher exemption caps.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- Military retirees with $30,000+ pensions (save $1,500-$2,000+ annually on state income tax)
- 50-100% disabled veterans (get property tax credit matching rating percentage)
- 100% disabled veterans (full property tax credit + free vehicle registration)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (Minnesota, Montana, California, Illinois)
- Veterans seeking affordable cost of living (median home $280,600)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans under 50% disabled (no property tax credit)
- Veterans without military retirement income (limited tax benefits)
- Veterans sensitive to cold weather (brutal winters, average January temps 5-17°F)

**Better options:**
- If you're not disabled and want lower overall taxes, consider **South Dakota or Wyoming** (no state income tax, lower sales tax)
- If you want better property tax exemptions for high-value homes, consider **Texas or Oklahoma** (higher exemption caps)
- If you want warmer weather with similar tax benefits, consider **Mississippi or Alabama**

## Additional Financial Benefits

- Annual savings: ~$30 compared to standard resident fishing license

**100% Disabled Veterans:**

Since 1893, the North Dakota Veterans Home has provided quality care for veterans. It's one of the best long-term care options for aging veterans in the state.

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish North Dakota residency immediately.** Get a driver's license, register to vote, file declaration of domicile. The sooner you're a resident, the sooner tax benefits begin.

2. **Apply for property tax credit by March 31.** File with your county auditor within months of moving. Missing the deadline costs you a full year of savings ($500-$1,200+).

3. **Update DFAS withholding for military retirement.** Stop North Dakota state income tax withholding from retirement pay—it's fully exempt. Adjust at mypay.dfas.mil.

4. **Apply for DAV license plates if you're 100% disabled.** Free registration, free vehicle excise tax (up to 2 vehicles), and handicap parking. Worth $2,000+ on vehicle purchase.

5. **Claim hunting/fishing license discounts.** If you're 50%+ disabled, get fishing license for $5 and hunting licenses for $3. Save $100+ annually.

6. **Get free state park permit.** 50%+ disabled veterans receive free lifetime state park entrance permits. Save $35/year.

7. **File North Dakota tax return to claim military retirement exemption.** Even if your federal income is substantial, subtract military retirement pay on your state return. Attach 1099-R from DFAS.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not filing property tax credit by March 31:** You'll pay full property tax for the year. In Fargo, that's $1,122 lost for a 100% disabled veteran.

- **Assuming property tax credit applies automatically:** It doesn't. You must file an affidavit with your county auditor proving eligibility.

- **Paying state income tax on military retirement:** North Dakota fully exempts it. Update DFAS withholding and claim the exemption on your state return.

- **Not applying for DAV plates:** 100% disabled veterans miss out on $2,000+ vehicle excise tax savings, plus free annual registration.

- **Filing in the wrong county:** Property tax is handled at the county level. File with the auditor in the county where your home is located (Cass County for Fargo, Burleigh for Bismarck, etc.).

- **Not verifying surviving spouse eligibility:** If your spouse is receiving DIC from the VA after your death, they retain the full property tax credit. Make sure they file to continue the benefit.
