## Understanding GERD VA Ratings

GERD is rated under 38 CFR § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (Hiatal hernia, with or without symptoms of GERD). Ratings are based on symptom frequency and persistence despite treatment.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** Two or more of the following:
- Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
- Pyrosis (heartburn)
- Regurgitation
- Arm or shoulder pain
- Or other symptom due to esophageal spasm or esophageal regurgitation

**What This Looks Like:**
- Heartburn several times per week
- Occasional regurgitation
- Some difficulty swallowing
- Symptoms controlled reasonably well with medication (PPIs like omeprazole, Nexium, etc.)
- Can eat most foods with some restrictions
- Occasional sleep disruption

**Monthly:** $171.23

**Most Common Rating** for GERD with regular symptoms managed by medication.

#### 30% Rating
**Criteria:** Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Frequent, persistent heartburn despite medication
- Regular regurgitation of food/acid
- Difficulty swallowing
- Chest pain from GERD
- Significant dietary restrictions
- Frequent sleep disruption
- May require higher doses or multiple medications
- Symptoms significantly impact quality of life despite treatment

**Monthly:** $524.31

**Key Difference from 10%:** Symptoms are "persistently recurrent" and cause "considerable impairment of health" despite medication.

#### 60% Rating
**Criteria:** Symptoms of pyrosis, dysphagia, and substernal or arm or shoulder pain productive of severe impairment of health.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Severe, uncontrolled symptoms despite maximum medical treatment
- Constant or near-constant heartburn
- Severe dysphagia (significant swallowing difficulty)
- Severe chest pain
- Major dietary restrictions (liquid diet, soft foods only)
- Significant weight loss
- Frequent ER visits
- May require surgical intervention
- Symptoms cause severe impairment despite all treatments

**Monthly:** $1,361.88

**Rare** - reserved for most severe, treatment-resistant cases.

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Medical Diagnosis

**Required:**
- Medical records documenting GERD diagnosis
- Treatment history with acid-reducing medications
- Symptom documentation over time

**Diagnostic Methods:**
- **Clinical diagnosis:** Based on symptoms and response to medication (most common)
- **Endoscopy (EGD):** Direct visualization of esophagus and stomach - shows inflammation, Barrett's, hiatal hernia
- **pH monitoring:** Measures acid in esophagus over 24 hours
- **Barium swallow:** X-ray study showing hiatal hernia or reflux
- **Esophageal manometry:** Tests esophageal muscle function

**Note:** Endoscopy not required for diagnosis, but strengthens evidence of severity.

### 2. Treatment Documentation

**Document:**
- Medications prescribed:
  - **PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors):** Omeprazole, esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix)
  - **H2 blockers:** Ranitidine (Zantac - now off market), famotidine (Pepcid)
  - **Antacids:** Tums, Maalox
- Medication dosages and frequency
- Medication increases or changes
- Side effects from medications
- Lifestyle modifications tried
- Surgical evaluation (if symptoms severe)

**Show Persistence Despite Treatment:**
- Key for higher ratings
- Document that symptoms continue despite medication compliance
- Multiple medication trials
- Increased dosages
- Combination therapy

### 3. Symptom Documentation

**Track:**
- **Heartburn (pyrosis):** Frequency, severity, timing, triggers
- **Regurgitation:** Frequency, circumstances (lying down, bending, after eating)
- **Dysphagia (swallowing difficulty):** Frequency, with solids vs. liquids, severity
- **Chest pain:** Location, severity, frequency, relationship to eating
- **Nausea**
- **Chronic cough:** From acid irritation
- **Hoarseness:** Especially morning hoarseness
- **Sore throat**
- **Sleep disruption:** Waking from reflux, need to elevate head

**Keep GERD Diary:**
- Daily symptoms
- Severity (1-10)
- Foods that trigger symptoms
- Medications taken
- Sleep disruption
- Activities limited

### 4. Functional Impact

**Document:**
- Dietary restrictions (avoid spicy, acidic, fatty foods; chocolate, caffeine, alcohol)
- Sleep positioning (must elevate head of bed)
- Sleep quality affected
- Social activities impacted (difficult to eat out, afraid of symptoms)
- Work impact (difficulty eating during work, symptoms during meetings)
- Weight loss from dietary restrictions or swallowing difficulty

### 5. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection:**
- GERD diagnosed during service or within one year of separation
- Service medical records documenting GERD symptoms
- Continuity of treatment

**Secondary Service Connection (Very Common):**
GERD secondary to another service-connected condition:

**Common Primary Conditions:**
- **PTSD:** Stress worsens GERD; PTSD medications can cause GERD
- **Medications for service-connected conditions:** NSAIDs for pain, aspirin for heart conditions
- **Sleep apnea:** Negative pressure changes can worsen reflux
- **Obesity (if secondary):** Increased abdominal pressure worsens GERD
- **Anxiety/Depression:** Stress worsens GERD; medications can cause GERD
- **Hernias (abdominal):** Can contribute to GERD

### 6. Nexus Opinion

Medical opinion linking GERD to service or service-connected condition.

**Strong Nexus Includes:**
- Review of medical history and medications
- Medical explanation of connection
- "At least as likely as not" statement
- Supporting medical literature

**Example Nexus (Secondary to PTSD):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's GERD is secondary to service-connected PTSD. Medical literature demonstrates that chronic stress and anxiety significantly worsen GERD through increased gastric acid production and altered esophageal motility. Additionally, the veteran's PTSD medications (SSRIs) can exacerbate reflux symptoms. The temporal relationship supports this connection, as the veteran's GERD symptoms began after PTSD onset."

**Example Nexus (Secondary to NSAIDs):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's GERD is secondary to chronic NSAID use for service-connected back pain. NSAIDs are well-known to cause and exacerbate GERD through direct irritation of the gastric and esophageal mucosa and by inhibiting protective prostaglandins. The veteran has taken daily ibuprofen for 10+ years for service-connected lumbar spine condition."

## C&P Examination Preparation

### Before the Exam

**1. Prepare Symptom Description:**
Be ready to describe in detail:
- **Heartburn:** Frequency (how many days per week), severity, timing (after meals, at night)
- **Regurgitation:** How often, what triggers it (bending, lying down), taste (acidic, bitter)
- **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing (solids, liquids, or both), how often, fear of choking
- **Chest pain:** Location, severity, how you distinguish from heart pain
- **Other symptoms:** Chronic cough, hoarseness, sore throat, nausea

**2. Document Medication Use:**
- Current medications (name, dose, frequency)
- How long on each medication
- Effectiveness (helps but doesn't eliminate symptoms vs. doesn't help much)
- Side effects
- Over-the-counter medication use (antacids, H2 blockers)
- Medication changes or increases over time

**3. Track Functional Impact:**
- Foods you must avoid
- Eating patterns (small frequent meals, can't eat before bed)
- Sleep disruption (how many nights per week, how many times per night)
- Social impact (avoiding restaurants, social eating situations)
- Work impact

**4. Bring Documentation:**
- Medication list
- Endoscopy reports
- Treatment records
- GERD symptom diary
- Personal statement

### During the Exam

**DO:**
- Describe ALL symptoms, not just heartburn
- Emphasize frequency and persistence **despite medication**
- Explain functional impact clearly
- Mention dietary restrictions in detail
- Discuss sleep disruption
- Describe swallowing difficulties if present
- Explain connection to service or service-connected condition
- Mention any ER visits or urgent care for severe symptoms

**DON'T:**
- Say medication "completely controls" symptoms (if it doesn't)
- Minimize symptom frequency
- Forget to mention dysphagia (key for 30-60% ratings)
- Fail to connect GERD to service-connected condition (if secondary claim)

**Critical Points to Emphasize:**

1. **Frequency:** "I have heartburn 5-7 days per week despite taking omeprazole daily."

2. **Persistence Despite Treatment:** "Even with my PPI twice daily, I still have significant symptoms. I've tried Nexium, Protonix, and omeprazole, and none fully controls my symptoms."

3. **Dysphagia:** "I have difficulty swallowing [X times per week]. Sometimes food gets stuck and I worry about choking. I have to chew very carefully and drink lots of water with meals."

4. **Chest Pain:** "I get chest pain from reflux several times per week. It's a burning pain in my chest that I've learned to distinguish from heart problems."

5. **Sleep Disruption:** "I wake up 3-4 nights per week with acid in my throat. I have to sleep with my bed elevated and still wake up choking on acid."

6. **Dietary Impact:** "I can't eat spicy food, tomato sauce, citrus, chocolate, coffee, or fatty foods. I have to eat small meals and can't eat within 3 hours of bedtime."

7. **Functional Impairment:** "GERD significantly impacts my quality of life. I avoid social eating situations, I'm constantly worried about symptoms, and my sleep is disrupted regularly."

**Step 2: Determine Service Connection Path**
- **Direct:** GERD during/shortly after service (less common)
- **Secondary:** GERD from medications for service-connected condition (most common)
- **Secondary:** GERD from stress of service-connected mental health condition
- **Aggravation:** Pre-existing GERD worsened by service

**Step 3: Document Symptoms and Impact**
- Keep GERD diary for 2-3 months
- Track medication use and effectiveness
- Document functional limitations
- Get lay statements from family about observed symptoms

**Step 4: Obtain Nexus**
- Gastroenterologist or primary care provider
- Explain connection to service-connected condition or service itself
- Provide medical literature if helpful (NSAIDs causing GERD, stress/PTSD connection, etc.)

**Step 5: File Comprehensively**
Submit:
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Medical records with GERD diagnosis
- Endoscopy reports (if available)
- Medication records
- Nexus letter
- Personal statement with functional impact and symptom diary
- Lay statements
- Evidence of primary service-connected condition (if secondary claim)

### Secondary Claim Strategy

**GERD Secondary to NSAID Use (Very Common):**

If you take NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin) for a service-connected condition, file GERD as secondary.

**Evidence:**
1. Service-connected condition requiring NSAIDs (back pain, arthritis, etc.)
2. Documentation of chronic NSAID use
3. GERD diagnosis
4. Nexus: NSAIDs cause GERD

**GERD Secondary to PTSD/Mental Health Conditions:**

Stress and anxiety worsen GERD, and psychiatric medications can cause it.

2. GERD diagnosis
3. Timeline showing GERD after mental health condition onset
4. Nexus: Chronic stress worsens GERD; medications contribute

**GERD Secondary to Sleep Apnea:**

Negative pressure changes during apneic events can worsen reflux.

**Evidence:**
1. Service-connected sleep apnea
2. GERD diagnosis
3. Nexus: Sleep apnea physiologically worsens GERD

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability for GERD even if it's controlled by medication?
Yes. The rating considers your symptoms WITH treatment. Even if medication helps, you can still be rated if you have persistent symptoms despite medication.

### Do I need an endoscopy to get a GERD rating?
No. GERD can be diagnosed clinically based on symptoms and response to treatment. However, endoscopy strengthens your claim and provides objective evidence.

### What's the difference between 10% and 30% ratings?
30% requires "persistently recurrent" symptoms causing "considerable impairment of health" despite treatment. 10% is regular symptoms that are reasonably controlled. Key is symptom persistence despite medication.

### How do I prove GERD is secondary to my service-connected condition?
Get a nexus letter from your doctor explaining the connection. Common: NSAIDs for pain conditions cause GERD, stress from PTSD worsens GERD, psychiatric medications contribute to GERD.

### Can medications for service-connected conditions cause GERD?
Yes. NSAIDs, aspirin, some psychiatric medications, and others can cause or worsen GERD. This qualifies as secondary service connection.

### What if my GERD isn't fully controlled by medication?
This is important for rating. Document continuing symptoms despite medication compliance. Try different medications and doses (under doctor supervision) and document that symptoms persist.

### Does diet restriction matter for rating?
Yes. Significant dietary restrictions are part of functional impairment. Document what foods you must avoid and how this impacts your life.

### Can I get more than 30% for GERD?
60% is possible but rare. Requires severe symptoms causing severe impairment of health despite maximum treatment. Usually involves severe dysphagia, significant weight loss, possible need for surgery.

### What if I have a hiatal hernia?
Hiatal hernia is rated under the same diagnostic code as GERD (7346). The rating is based on GERD symptoms, not just presence of hernia.

### Will my GERD rating be reduced if I get surgery?
Not if symptoms persist. If surgery completely resolves GERD, rating could potentially be reduced. However, many post-surgical patients still have some symptoms.

### Can I get separate ratings for GERD and IBS?
Yes. They are separate conditions rated under different diagnostic codes. Both can be secondary to the same primary condition (e.g., both secondary to PTSD).

### How long should I document symptoms before filing?
Ideally 2-3 months of consistent symptom tracking. Shows pattern of frequency and persistence.

### Does Barrett's esophagus qualify for a higher rating?
Barrett's is evidence of chronic severe GERD but doesn't automatically mean higher rating. It supports severity but rating still based on current symptoms. However, Barrett's with dysphagia and other severe symptoms would support 30% or 60%.

### Can GERD be rated for cancerous conditions that develop?
Esophageal cancer from chronic GERD would be rated separately under cancer diagnostic codes, typically at 100% during active treatment, then based on residuals.

## Final Thoughts

GERD is a chronic condition that significantly impacts quality of life through persistent symptoms, dietary restrictions, sleep disruption, and medication side effects. Many veterans develop GERD from medications taken for service-connected conditions or from stress related to service-connected mental health conditions.

**Keys to a Successful GERD Claim:**

1. **Get proper diagnosis** - See GI specialist if possible
2. **Try treatment** - Document medication use and persistence of symptoms despite treatment
3. **Track symptoms** - Keep diary for 2-3 months
4. **Identify connection** - Direct or (more commonly) secondary to medications or other conditions
5. **Emphasize impact** - Dietary restrictions, sleep disruption, quality of life
6. **Get nexus** - Medical opinion connecting GERD to service or service-connected condition
7. **Consider endoscopy** - If symptoms severe, endoscopy provides objective evidence

**Remember:** The key for higher ratings is showing symptoms persist despite medication, especially dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) and symptoms causing considerable impairment of health.

GERD is often underrecognized as a service-connected condition. If you're taking medications for service-connected conditions that cause GERD, or if you have GERD related to service-connected mental health conditions, you deserve compensation.

**File your GERD claim. You earned it.**
