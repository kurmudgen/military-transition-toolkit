### Application Tips

**Resume:**
- Professional headshot (aviation appropriate)
- Emphasize safety record and customer service
- Quantify: flights, passengers, routes, performance recognitions
- Include languages spoken (huge advantage)
- Highlight VIP service and protocol experience

**Cover Letter:**
- Express passion for aviation and service

- "Describe your experience working with diverse people"
- "Tell me about a time you had to adapt to unexpected changes"
- "What does safety mean to you?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Waiting to Apply**
Airlines have hiring windows and class dates months in advance. Apply 6-12 months before separation to align training with your availability. Don't wait until you separate - you'll miss hiring cycles.

**2. Only Applying to One Airline**
Apply to multiple airlines simultaneously. Different airlines have different cultures, pay structures, and hiring timelines. Don't put all eggs in one basket.

**3. Ignoring Corporate Aviation**
Corporate aviation pays better starting salary ($50,000-$65,000 vs. $30,000-$40,000) with better work-life balance, but requires specialized training ($4,000-$6,000 investment). Many military FAs don't know this path exists.

**4. Poor Interview Presentation**
Airlines assess appearance, grooming, communication, and professionalism heavily. Military members sometimes underestimate how much appearance matters in civilian airline interviews. Invest in professional attire and grooming.

**5. Not Researching Base Options**
Your base determines quality of life. Research cost of living, crash pad availability, commuting viability, and lifestyle before accepting offers. Being based in San Francisco (expensive, hard to afford) is very different from Atlanta (affordable, easy lifestyle).

**6. Underestimating Financial Impact of Training**
Most airline training is unpaid or small stipend for 4-8 weeks. Then reserve status (on-call) for 1-2 years means irregular income. Have 3-6 months emergency savings before starting.

**7. Not Joining Veteran Employee Resource Groups**
Airlines have veteran ERGs that provide mentorship, insider tips, and support during applications. Not connecting with these groups means missing valuable support network.

## Success Stories

**Case Study 1: E-5 to Delta Flight Attendant**
