## Why Preparation Matters

The difference between a prepared veteran and an unprepared one can be **thousands of dollars per month** in compensation.

**Unprepared veteran:** Shows up, downplays symptoms, forgets key information, gets 10% rating.

**Prepared veteran:** Brings documentation, describes symptoms accurately including worst days and flare-ups, demonstrates functional impact, gets 50% rating.

Same condition. Different outcomes. Preparation is the difference.
