# Peripheral Neuropathy Secondary to Diabetes: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Extremely strong medical connection
- **Medical nexus required?** YES, but connection is well-established
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-40% per extremity
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected diabetes, neuropathy diagnosis, EMG/NCS, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Very high (80-90%) with documented diabetic neuropathy

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is one of the most well-established secondary conditions. If you have service-connected diabetes and have developed nerve damage in your extremities, this is a highly viable secondary claim that can significantly increase your rating.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes:
- Your diabetes must be service-connected
- Peripheral neuropathy must be diagnosed
- Medical evidence links neuropathy to diabetes

## How Diabetes Causes Peripheral Neuropathy

### The Medical Connection

**Mechanism of Diabetic Neuropathy:**
- Chronic high blood sugar damages small blood vessels
- Blood vessels supplying nerves are affected
- Nerves are deprived of oxygen and nutrients
- Progressive nerve fiber damage occurs
- Results in sensory and motor symptoms

### Types of Diabetic Neuropathy

**Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy (Most Common):**
- "Stocking-glove" distribution
- Starts in feet, progresses upward
- Later affects hands
- Sensory symptoms predominate

**Autonomic Neuropathy:**
- Affects involuntary functions
- Can affect bladder, bowels, heart rate
- Rated separately

**Focal Neuropathies:**
- Specific nerve involvement
- Carpal tunnel common in diabetics

### Statistics

- 50% of diabetics develop neuropathy
- Risk increases with duration and poor control
- Major cause of foot ulcers and amputations

## Symptoms of Diabetic Neuropathy

### Sensory Symptoms

**Positive Symptoms (Abnormal Sensations):**
- Burning pain
- Tingling (paresthesias)
- Electric shock sensations
- Hypersensitivity to touch

**Negative Symptoms (Loss of Sensation):**
- Numbness
- Loss of position sense
- Inability to feel temperature
- Loss of vibration sense

### Motor Symptoms

- Weakness in feet/ankles
- Muscle wasting
- Foot drop (severe cases)
- Difficulty walking

### Distribution Pattern

**Lower Extremities:**
- Starts in toes/feet
- Progresses up legs
- Usually symmetric (both sides)

**Upper Extremities:**
- Develops later
- Starts in fingers/hands
- Progresses up arms

## VA Rating Criteria for Peripheral Neuropathy

Diabetic neuropathy is rated under the peripheral nerve codes, most commonly:

### Sciatic Nerve (DC 8520) - Lower Extremity

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Moderately severe incomplete paralysis |
| 60% | Severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy |
| 80% | Complete paralysis |

### External Popliteal (Peroneal) Nerve (DC 8521)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 30% | Severe incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Complete paralysis (foot drop) |

### Median Nerve (DC 8515) - Upper Extremity

| Rating | Criteria (Major/Minor) |
|--------|----------|
| 10%/10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 30%/20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 50%/40% | Severe incomplete paralysis |

### Ulnar Nerve (DC 8516) - Upper Extremity

| Rating | Criteria (Major/Minor) |
|--------|----------|
| 10%/10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 30%/20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 40%/30% | Severe incomplete paralysis |

### What Constitutes Mild/Moderate/Severe?

**Mild:**
- Subjective symptoms (numbness, tingling)
- Minimal objective findings
- No significant weakness
- Minimal EMG changes

**Moderate:**
- Clear sensory loss on examination
- Mild weakness
- Abnormal reflexes
- Moderate EMG abnormalities

**Severe:**
- Significant sensory loss
- Marked weakness
- Absent reflexes
- Muscle atrophy
- Significant EMG abnormalities

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Diabetes:**
- Service connection documentation
- Current rating
- HbA1c history (blood sugar control)
- Duration of diabetes

**For Neuropathy:**
- Formal neuropathy diagnosis
- Neurological examination
- EMG/Nerve conduction study
- Treatment records

### Key Diagnostic Tests

**EMG/Nerve Conduction Study:**
- Confirms nerve involvement
- Identifies specific nerves affected
- Shows severity
- Distinguishes diabetic from other causes

**Monofilament Testing:**
- Tests sensation in feet
- Documents loss of protective sensation
- Simple, objective test

**Vibratory Sense Testing:**
- Tests large nerve fiber function
- Often abnormal early

### The Nexus Letter

**Often Straightforward Because:**
- Connection is extremely well-established
- 50% of diabetics develop neuropathy
- Pattern is recognizable

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for type 2 diabetes mellitus at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, bilateral lower extremities*

*Clinical Findings:*
*- Bilateral stocking distribution sensory loss*
*- Absent ankle reflexes*
*- Decreased vibratory sense*
*- EMG: Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected diabetes mellitus.*

*Medical Rationale: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common and well-established complication of diabetes mellitus, occurring in approximately 50% of diabetic patients. The mechanism involves chronic hyperglycemia causing damage to the vasa nervorum (small blood vessels supplying nerves) and direct metabolic effects on nerve fibers. [Veteran's] neuropathy demonstrates classic features of diabetic polyneuropathy: symmetric, distal predominant, affecting sensory fibers, with EMG findings consistent with axonal degeneration. The pattern is pathognomonic for diabetic neuropathy."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Document Your Symptoms

Track:
- Numbness/tingling locations
- Pain characteristics
- Weakness
- Impact on walking, balance
- Falls

### Step 2: Get EMG/Nerve Conduction Study

Request this test:
- Confirms diagnosis
- Identifies affected nerves
- Documents severity
- Critical for rating

### Step 3: Establish Connection

Document:
- Duration of diabetes
- Typical pattern of diabetic neuropathy
- No other causes identified

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get physician opinion:
- Endocrinologist, neurologist, or primary care
- Usually straightforward given established connection
- Cost: $500-$1,000

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Specify EACH extremity affected
- Link to diabetes
- Upload evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Neurological examination expected
- Sensory testing
- Reflex testing
- EMG may be performed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not claiming each extremity** - Rate each limb separately

2. **Missing EMG** - Objective evidence crucial

3. **Not specifying nerves** - Each nerve can be rated

4. **Forgetting upper extremities** - If hands affected, claim them too

5. **Waiting until severe** - Claim when diagnosed

6. **No documentation of progression** - Show it's gotten worse

7. **Missing bilateral factor** - Both legs/arms = bilateral factor applied

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Bilateral Lower Extremity

**Background:** 58-year-old veteran, diabetes 20% for 15 years
- Bilateral foot numbness
- Burning pain at night
- EMG confirms diabetic neuropathy

**Evidence:**
- EMG showing bilateral neuropathy
- Monofilament testing abnormal
- Nexus from endocrinologist

**Outcome:**
- Right lower extremity: 20% (moderate)
- Left lower extremity: 20% (moderate)
**Combined with bilateral factor: 36%**
**Total Combined Rating:** 20% → 50%

### Case Study 2: Four Extremities

**Background:** 62-year-old veteran, diabetes 40%
- Diabetic for 20 years
- Neuropathy in all four extremities
- Requires assistive devices

**Evidence:**
- EMG showing four-extremity involvement
- Documentation of weakness
- Fall history

**Outcome:**
- Each lower: 40% (moderately severe)
- Each upper: 20% (moderate)
**Bilateral factors applied**
**Combined Rating:** Increased to 90%+

### Case Study 3: Progression Claim

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran
- Already had 10% each leg for neuropathy
- Symptoms worsened
- Filed for increase

**Evidence:**
- New EMG showing progression
- Documentation of motor weakness
- Functional decline

**Outcome:** Each leg increased to 20%
**Combined Rating:** Increased modestly

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Bilateral Lower Extremity 20% Each:**
- Before: 20% diabetes
- Add 20% + 20% with bilateral factor = ~36%
- Combined: 20% + 36% = ~49% → rounds to 50%
- Significant monthly increase

**Four Extremity Involvement:**
- Cumulative ratings can be substantial
- Bilateral factors for legs AND arms
- Can push combined rating to 80-100%

## Bilateral Factor

### How It Works

If both legs or both arms are affected:
- Combine ratings for affected extremities
- Add 10% of that combined value
- Then add to overall combined rating

**Example:**
- Right leg: 20%
- Left leg: 20%
- Combined: 36%
- Bilateral factor: 36% + 3.6% = 39.6%
- Then combined with other ratings

## Associated Conditions

### Often Occurs Together

If you have diabetic neuropathy, also consider:
- **Diabetic retinopathy** (eye damage)
- **Diabetic nephropathy** (kidney damage)
- **Peripheral vascular disease**
- **Erectile dysfunction**
- **Foot ulcers/infections**

### Building the Claim

Diabetes can support multiple secondary claims:
- Each complication is separate
- All are well-established connections
- Can significantly increase combined rating

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No nexus"** - Need medical opinion
2. **"Symptoms part of diabetes rating"** - Neuropathy is separate
3. **"Not severe enough"** - EMG documentation helps

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add EMG if not done
- Neurologist nexus
- Document specific nerve involvement
- Show functional impact

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Each extremity is rated separately?**
A: Yes. Each leg/arm gets its own rating.

**Q: What's the bilateral factor?**
A: A 10% addition when paired extremities are affected.

**Q: Do I need an EMG?**
A: Highly recommended. Provides objective confirmation.

**Q: What if only feet are numb?**
A: Can still claim. Lower extremity neuropathy starts in feet.

**Q: Can neuropathy improve?**
A: Rarely reverses. Usually stable or progressive.

**Q: What if I also have neuropathy from Agent Orange?**
A: Rate the condition; cause doesn't change rating.

**Q: Is 10% per leg typical?**
A: For mild neuropathy, yes. Moderate to severe rates higher.
