## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 255A Information Services Technicians (Warrant Officers)—you're experienced IT professionals with deep technical expertise and leadership experience managing enterprise information systems. Your **network administration expertise, information systems management, cybersecurity implementation, technical leadership, troubleshooting skills, Top Secret clearance, and proven ability to manage complex IT infrastructure** make you highly valuable to corporate IT departments, defense contractors, and technology companies. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$110,000-$145,000** in IT management, systems administration, or network engineering roles, scaling to **$145,000-$195,000+** in senior IT leadership, cloud architecture, or cybersecurity management positions. Experienced 255As leading enterprise IT operations or serving as IT directors can earn **$170,000-$280,000+**.

Your warrant officer experience translates directly to senior technical roles and IT management—you've led technical teams, managed million-dollar budgets, coordinated with senior leadership, and made strategic IT decisions. Your **Top Secret clearance adds $25,000-$45,000** annual salary premium for defense contractor and federal positions.

The IT job market is strong with consistent demand for experienced professionals. Unlike entry-level IT roles, your 10-20+ years of military IT experience positions you for mid-to-senior level positions immediately. Companies value warrant officers for your deep technical knowledge combined with leadership maturity—you're not fresh out of college, you're a proven IT professional.

## What Does an Army 255A Information Services Technician Do?

As a 255A Information Services Technician, you supervised and managed information system assets, including automated information systems (AIS), IP-based local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and enterprise IT infrastructure. You led teams of IT specialists, managed large-scale network operations, implemented cybersecurity programs, coordinated with senior leadership on IT strategy, and ensured mission-critical systems remained operational.

Your responsibilities included network planning and architecture, system administration and maintenance, cybersecurity implementation and compliance (IA/CND programs), technical training and team leadership, troubleshooting complex technical issues, vendor coordination and contract management, IT budget planning and resource allocation, and strategic IT planning supporting organizational objectives.

You operated at battalion, brigade, division, or installation level—managing IT infrastructure supporting hundreds to thousands of users. You held Top Secret clearance and managed classified and unclassified networks with strict security requirements. You made technical decisions affecting mission success and advised commanders on IT capabilities and limitations.

Unlike junior IT specialists, you operated at the strategic and operational level—not just fixing problems but architecting solutions, leading teams, and aligning IT with organizational goals.

### 6-12 Months Before Retirement (continued)

- Practice interviews—prepare STAR method examples of IT leadership
- Attend IT conferences or virtual events
- Join professional organizations: ISACA, ISSA, (ISC)², CompTIA

### Final 6 Months

**Job Search & Interviews**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1: Undervaluing your experience**
You're a senior IT professional with 10-20 years of experience. Don't accept entry-level IT positions or salaries. Target management or senior technical roles.

**Mistake #2: Letting clearance lapse**
Accept cleared position within 2 years of retirement or lose $25K-$45K annual premium. Defense contractors pay significantly more for active clearances.

**Mistake #3: Targeting only defense contractors**
Corporate IT often pays more than defense contractors. Explore healthcare, finance, tech, and other high-paying industries.

**Mistake #4: Poor resume translation**
Don't write "managed DISN connectivity" or use Army acronyms. Write "managed enterprise WAN connecting 15 locations with 99.9% uptime."

**Mistake #5: Skipping certifications**
CISSP, PMP, and cloud certifications each add $15K-$40K to your salary. They're worth the investment.

**Mistake #6: Not researching compensation**
Use Glassdoor, salary.com, levels.fyi to research salaries. Warrant officers often undersell themselves compared to civilian IT managers.

**Mistake #7: Accepting first offer without negotiating**
IT management salaries are negotiable. Ask for $10K-$20K more than initial offer. The worst they say is no.

- CISSP + PMP + cloud certification = $50K-$80K salary boost
- Corporate IT often pays more than defense contractors
- First offer: $110K-$145K realistic; $160K-$220K within 5-10 years achievable
- Geographic location significantly impacts salary (NYC/SF pay 30-40% more)

You've managed mission-critical IT systems supporting national defense. Corporate IT leadership is your next mission. Execute the plan.
