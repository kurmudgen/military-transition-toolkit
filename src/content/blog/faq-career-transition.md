## RESUME WRITING (Q201-Q220)

### Q201: How do I translate my military experience for a civilian resume? {#q201}

**A:** Translate military experience by converting job titles to civilian equivalents, removing jargon and acronyms, quantifying achievements with numbers, and focusing on transferable skills that employers value like leadership, project management, and problem-solving.

Civilians don't speak military. Your resume must translate your skills into language hiring managers understand without losing the impact of your accomplishments.

**Key translation strategies:**

**1. Convert military job titles to civilian equivalents**

| Military Title | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Squad Leader, Infantry | Team Supervisor, Operations |
| Logistics Specialist | Supply Chain Coordinator |
| Intelligence Analyst | Data Analyst / Intelligence Specialist |
| Communications Officer | Telecommunications Manager |
| Motor Transport Operator | Fleet Driver / Transportation Specialist |
| Administrative Specialist | Administrative Coordinator |
| Aircraft Maintenance Technician | Aviation Maintenance Technician |

**Don't write:** "Served as 11B Team Leader in 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment"
**Do write:** "Led 4-person operations team in high-pressure tactical environments"

**2. Eliminate military jargon and acronyms**

**Remove or translate:**
- MOS, AFSC, Rating → Job specialty, Position
- NCOIC, OIC → Supervisor, Manager, Lead
- Battalion, Brigade → Organization, Department
- Platoon, Squad → Team, Unit
- SI units, classified → Sensitive operations

**Example transformation:**

**Before (military-heavy):**
> "Served as NCOIC of battalion-level S-4 shop. Managed PBUSE for all organic equipment. Coordinated with BDE-level personnel for Class IX requisitions."

**After (civilian-friendly):**
> "Supervised logistics operations team managing $2M in equipment. Coordinated with organizational leadership for supply procurement and inventory management. Maintained 98% equipment readiness rate."

**3. Quantify everything**

Civilians love numbers. Quantify your impact wherever possible:

**Quantifiable metrics:**
- People managed: "Led team of 12 personnel"
- Budget: "Managed $5M annual budget"
- Equipment value: "Maintained $10M in assets"
- Results: "Increased efficiency by 30%"
- Time: "Completed project 15% ahead of schedule"
- Accuracy: "Achieved 99.8% accuracy rate"
- Training: "Trained 150+ new employees"

**Before:**
> "Responsible for vehicle maintenance"

**After:**
> "Managed maintenance operations for 45-vehicle fleet valued at $8M, achieving 95% operational readiness rate"

**4. Focus on transferable skills**

**Skills civilians value:**
- Leadership and team management
- Project planning and execution
- Budget management
- Training and development
- Process improvement
- Quality assurance
- Risk management
- Strategic planning
- Communication (written and verbal)
- Problem-solving under pressure
- Cross-functional collaboration

**Example resume bullets highlighting transferable skills:**

**Leadership:**
> "Supervised and developed 15-person team, conducting performance evaluations and mentoring junior staff to promote professional growth"

**Project Management:**
> "Planned and executed 12 complex operations involving coordination of 50+ personnel and $2M in resources across multiple locations"

**Process Improvement:**
> "Identified and implemented efficiency improvements reducing equipment downtime by 25% and saving $150K annually"

**5. Use civilian industry keywords**

To pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and attract recruiters, incorporate keywords from the job posting.

**Job posting says:** "Seeking candidate with project management experience, budget oversight, and team leadership"

**Your resume should include:** "Project management," "budget oversight," "team leadership" (exact phrases when possible)

**6. Structure accomplishments using the STAR method (abbreviated for resume)**

- **S**ituation: Brief context
- **T**ask: Your responsibility
- **A**ction: What you did
- **R**esult: Quantifiable outcome

**Example:**
> "Identified supply chain bottleneck affecting mission readiness (Situation). Led cross-functional team to redesign procurement process (Action), reducing supply lead time by 40% and improving operational readiness from 85% to 96% (Result)."

**7. Use a professional resume format**

**Avoid:**
- Military-style format with dense paragraphs
- Excessive detail on ranks and decorations civilians don't understand
- Multiple-page resumes for entry/mid-level positions

**Do:**
- Clean, modern format (reverse-chronological)
- Bullet points (not paragraphs)
- 1 page for <10 years experience, 2 pages if 10+ years
- Clear section headers (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills)
- Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)

**8. Leverage military skills translator tools**

**Free tools:**
- **Military.com Skills Translator:** Enter your MOS/AFSC/Rating, get civilian job matches
- **SkillMil AI Resume Builder:** Free for veterans
- **O*NET Military Crosswalk:** Matches military jobs to civilian occupations

These tools provide civilian job titles, descriptions, and keywords for your military role.

**Example: Using Skills Translator**

**Input:** MOS 13F (Fire Support Specialist)
**Output:** Civilian matches include: Intelligence Analyst, GIS Technician, Operations Coordinator, Data Analyst

Then incorporate these keywords into your resume.

**9. Create a strong professional summary**

Replace the objective statement with a 3-4 line summary highlighting:
- Years of experience
- Key skills
- Quantified achievements
- What you bring to the role

**Example:**
> "Results-driven operations professional with 8 years of experience leading high-performing teams in fast-paced, high-stakes environments. Proven expertise in project management, logistics coordination, and process optimization. Successfully managed multi-million dollar budgets and led teams of up to 25 personnel. Seeking to leverage leadership and analytical skills in a civilian operations management role."

**10. Highlight relevant education and certifications**

**Military education to include:**
- Degree programs (convert to standard titles: "Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration" not "Completed SOS")
- Professional Military Education (translate: "Advanced Leadership Course" not "WLC, ALC, SLC")
- Relevant certifications: PMP, Security+, Lean Six Sigma, etc.
- Technical training (if relevant to job)

**Common resume mistakes veterans make:**

**Mistake 1: Too much military jargon**
- Problem: Hiring managers don't understand
- Fix: Translate every acronym, remove military-specific terms

**Mistake 2: Focusing on duties, not accomplishments**
- Problem: Doesn't show your impact
- Fix: Every bullet should show a result, not just a responsibility

**Mistake 3: Underselling your experience**
- Problem: Veterans often downplay accomplishments
- Fix: A platoon sergeant managed a $5M budget and led 40 people—that's significant

**Mistake 4: Including irrelevant information**
- Problem: Medals, formations, and equipment civilians don't understand
- Fix: Focus on accomplishments and skills

**Mistake 5: Not tailoring resume to each job**
- Problem: Generic resume doesn't match job keywords
- Fix: Customize resume for every application

**Full example: Before and After**

**BEFORE (Military-heavy):**

> **Squad Leader, 11B Infantry | 2018-2024**
> - Served as SL in mechanized infantry unit
> - Responsible for training and welfare of 9 soldiers
> - Conducted STX lanes and EST training
> - Managed OCIE and weapons for squad
> - Deployed to Kuwait in support of OIR

**AFTER (Civilian-friendly):**

> **Team Leader, Operations | 2018-2024**
> - Led and developed 9-person team in high-pressure tactical environments, conducting quarterly performance evaluations and mentoring to promote career growth
> - Designed and delivered 50+ training programs, resulting in 100% team certification rate
> - Managed inventory and maintenance of $750K in equipment, achieving 98% operational readiness
> - Coordinated logistics and operations for 400-person unit during 9-month overseas deployment
> - Recognized as top performer, selected for advanced leadership responsibilities ahead of peers

### Q202: What is an ATS and how do I optimize my resume for it? {#q202}

**A:** An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is software that scans and filters resumes before humans see them, and you optimize for it by using keywords from the job description, simple formatting, and standard section headings.

More than 98% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS, and up to 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS before a recruiter ever sees them. Understanding how to pass ATS screening is critical for veterans entering the civilian job market.

**What is an ATS?**

**Applicant Tracking System (ATS):**
- Software that automatically scans, parses, and ranks resumes
- Filters candidates based on keywords, skills, and qualifications
- Used by companies to manage large volumes of applications
- Scores resumes and sends only top-ranked ones to human recruiters

**How ATS works:**

1. **Parsing:** ATS scans your resume and extracts information (name, contact, experience, skills)
2. **Keyword matching:** Compares your resume to the job description
3. **Scoring:** Assigns a score based on how well you match requirements
4. **Ranking:** Ranks all applicants by score
5. **Filtering:** Recruiters only review top-ranked candidates (often top 20-30%)

**Common ATS software:**
- Taleo
- Workday
- Greenhouse
- iCIMS
- Lever
- BambooHR

Each works slightly differently, but optimization strategies are similar.

**How to optimize your resume for ATS:**

**1. Use keywords from the job description**

**Most important ATS strategy:** Mirror the language in the job posting.

**Job posting says:**
> "Seeking candidate with project management experience, proficiency in Microsoft Excel, and strong communication skills"

**Your resume should include:**
- "Project management"
- "Microsoft Excel"
- "Communication skills"

Use the EXACT phrases when possible (not synonyms).

**Bad:** "Managed projects" (if job says "project management")
**Good:** "Project management experience"

**How to identify keywords:**

1. Read the job description carefully
2. Highlight required skills, qualifications, and keywords
3. Note repeated phrases (those are most important)
4. Include technical skills, certifications, software, and industry terms

**Example keywords to include:**
- Technical skills: "Python," "SQL," "Salesforce"
- Soft skills: "Leadership," "Communication," "Problem-solving"
- Certifications: "PMP," "Security+," "Lean Six Sigma"
- Industry terms: "Supply chain management," "Agile methodology"

**2. Use standard section headings**

ATS looks for specific section names.

**Use these (ATS-friendly):**
- Summary or Professional Summary
- Experience or Professional Experience or Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Certifications

**Avoid these (ATS may not recognize):**
- "Where I've Been" instead of Experience
- "What I Know" instead of Skills
- Creative headers that confuse ATS

**3. Use simple, clean formatting**

**ATS-friendly formatting:**
- Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Helvetica)
- Font size 10-12pt
- Standard margins (0.5-1 inch)
- Left-aligned text
- Bullet points (using standard bullets, not custom symbols)
- No text boxes, tables, columns, or graphics
- No headers/footers (ATS may not read them)
- Consistent formatting (all dates formatted the same way, etc.)

**ATS-unfriendly formatting:**
- Tables and columns (ATS can't parse correctly)
- Text boxes or graphics
- Images, logos, or photos
- Fancy fonts or colors
- Headers/footers containing important information
- Special characters or symbols

**4. File format matters**

**Preferred formats:**
- **.docx** (Microsoft Word) - usually best
- **.pdf** - works with most modern ATS, but some older systems struggle

**Check the job posting** for preferred format. If it says "upload as PDF," do that. If it says ".docx preferred," use that.

**Avoid:**
- .pages (Mac format)
- .txt (loses formatting)
- .jpg or image files

**5. Incorporate skills throughout the resume**

Don't just list skills in a "Skills" section—integrate them into your experience bullets.

**Example:**

**Skills section:**
> Project Management | Microsoft Excel | Data Analysis

**Experience section:**
> "Led project management efforts for 15+ initiatives, utilizing Microsoft Excel for data analysis and reporting, achieving 95% on-time delivery rate"

This way, keywords appear multiple times and in context.

**6. Don't keyword stuff**

**Keyword stuffing (DON'T DO THIS):**
> "Project management project management project management Microsoft Excel Excel Excel..."

**Why it fails:**
- ATS detects keyword stuffing and may flag your resume
- Reads poorly if it gets to a human
- Shows desperation and poor judgment

**Do this instead:** Use keywords naturally in context throughout your resume.

**7. Spell out acronyms (first use)**

**ATS may not recognize acronyms**, especially military ones.

**Do this:**
> "Project Management Professional (PMP) certified"
> "Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science"
> "Supervisory experience as Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC)"

Then you can use the acronym (PMP, BS, NCOIC) later in the resume.

**8. Use standard job titles**

If your actual job title was "Fire Support Specialist," but you're applying for "Data Analyst" roles:

**Option 1:** Use civilian equivalent in parentheses
> "Data Analyst (Fire Support Specialist) | U.S. Army | 2018-2024"

**Option 2:** Use your military title but lead with civilian translation in your description
> "Fire Support Specialist (Intelligence & Data Analysis) | U.S. Army | 2018-2024"

**9. Include a skills section**

**Create a dedicated "Skills" section** with keywords listed clearly.

**Example:**

**Skills:**
- Project Management
- Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, PowerPoint, Word)
- Data Analysis
- Team Leadership
- Process Improvement
- Budget Management
- Communication (written & verbal)
- Risk Management

This helps ATS quickly identify your skills and match them to the job requirements.

**10. Save with a clear file name**

**Good file names:**
- `JohnSmith_Resume_DataAnalyst.docx`
- `JaneSmith_Resume.pdf`

**Bad file names:**
- `resume_final_FINAL_v3.docx`
- `updated_resume.pdf`
- `MyResume.docx`

Clear file names help with organization and professionalism.

**How to test if your resume is ATS-friendly:**

**Method 1: Copy-paste test**
- Copy your entire resume
- Paste into a plain text editor (Notepad)
- If the formatting is destroyed or text is jumbled, ATS will struggle too

**Method 2: Use free ATS scanners**
- Jobscan.co - compares your resume to job description and gives ATS compatibility score
- ResumeWorded - free ATS resume scanner
- SkillSyncer - ATS resume scanner

**Method 3: Save as .txt**
- Save your resume as a .txt file
- Open it and see if information is readable and in the right order
- This is how ATS "sees" your resume

**Common ATS failures:**

| Issue | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Tables | ATS can't parse | Use standard formatting |
| Graphics | ATS can't read images | Remove all graphics |
| Creative section headers | ATS doesn't recognize | Use standard headers |
| Missing keywords | No match to job description | Add job-specific keywords |
| Wrong file format | ATS can't open | Use .docx or .pdf |
| Headers/footers | ATS may skip | Put all info in main body |

**Balancing ATS optimization with human readability:**

Your resume must pass **two tests:**
1. **ATS test:** Keyword-rich, simple formatting
2. **Human test:** Readable, visually appealing, compelling

**How to balance:**
- Use keywords naturally (not stuffed)
- Keep formatting clean but not overly sparse
- Use white space for readability
- Bold section headers and company names for visual hierarchy
- Bullet points with strong action verbs

**Bottom line on ATS:**

- **Keywords are king:** Use exact phrases from job description
- **Simple formatting:** No tables, graphics, fancy fonts
- **Standard sections:** Use recognized section names
- **File format:** .docx or .pdf as specified
- **Test your resume:** Use ATS scanners to check compatibility

Your resume must pass the ATS gatekeeper before a human ever sees it. Optimize for ATS first, then ensure it's compelling for human readers.
