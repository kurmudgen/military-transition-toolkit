## Bottom Line Up Front

You're not just a military truck driver—you're a **professional transportation operator with heavy vehicle experience, convoy operations leadership, defensive driving expertise, vehicle maintenance knowledge, load planning skills, and proven ability to execute missions under pressure**. The civilian trucking industry is desperate for qualified drivers. There's a shortage of 78,000+ CDL drivers in 2024, and it's growing to 80,000+ by 2025. That means leverage for you.

Realistic first-year CDL Class A truck driver salaries range from **$55,000-$75,000** for company drivers, scaling to **$75,000-$95,000** for experienced drivers with clean records and specialized endorsements. Owner-operators can gross **$150,000-$250,000** annually (net $80K-$150K after expenses). Beyond driving, transportation coordinator, dispatcher, fleet manager, and safety director positions earn **$60,000-$90,000+**. Your military driving experience is worth real money—companies will pay for your skills.

Here's the deal: most states have "Troops to Truckers" programs that let you skip the CDL skills test and go straight to the written exam. You've already driven heavy military vehicles—HEMTTs, LMTVs, 5-tons, fuel tankers, cargo trucks. That experience translates directly to civilian Class A and B commercial vehicles. Get your CDL (costs $3,000-$8,000 if you pay; $0 with company-sponsored training), and you're immediately employable at $55K-$75K. Within 2-3 years, experienced drivers with clean records earn $75K-$95K. If you go owner-operator (buy your own truck), you can gross $150K-$250K, though expenses eat 30-50% of that.

The trucking industry isn't glamorous. You'll work long hours, deal with traffic, spend nights away from home, and handle the physical demands of driving. But it's stable, in-demand, and pays well. Major carriers like Schneider, Werner, J.B. Hunt, and UPS actively recruit veterans and offer sign-on bonuses ($5,000-$15,000), tuition reimbursement, and clear career paths. If you want to stay home more, local delivery, LTL (less-than-truckload), or fleet management roles keep you regional or home daily while still earning solid income.

You've already proven you can drive anything, anywhere, under any conditions. Now it's time to get paid what you're worth.

## What Does an Army 88M Motor Transport Operator Do?

As an 88M, you operated and maintained everything from HMMWVs to 10-ton cargo trucks, fuel tankers, and Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTTs). You drove convoys through hostile territory, maneuvered through austere conditions, and executed mission-critical transportation operations. You conducted pre-operational vehicle inspections, performed operator-level maintenance (PMCS), and ensured vehicles were mission-capable.

You loaded and secured cargo following weight distribution and tie-down procedures. You navigated using maps, GPS, and terrain analysis—often in blackout drive conditions. You led convoy operations, maintained proper vehicle spacing, communicated via radio, and responded to threats. You understood trip planning, fuel management, route analysis, and risk mitigation.

You worked in all conditions—120-degree desert heat, sub-zero cold, sandstorms, rain, ice, and under enemy fire. You drove vehicles worth $250,000-$400,000 and transported millions in equipment. You maintained safety and accountability even when exhausted, stressed, and far from support. When your unit needed equipment moved, you made it happen—no excuses, no failures.

That's not just "driving trucks." That's **professional transportation operations, defensive driving, heavy equipment operation, convoy security, load planning, vehicle maintenance, risk management, and mission execution under pressure**. The civilian trucking world calls that a Class A CDL driver, fleet operator, logistics specialist, and transportation professional.

## Skills You've Developed That Translate Directly

**Technical Skills:**

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| HEMTT, LMTV, PLS, fuel tanker operation | Class A CDL (tractor-trailer, tanker, heavy trucks) |
| HMMWV, FMTV, 5-ton operation | Class B CDL (straight trucks, delivery vehicles) |
| Convoy operations | Long-haul trucking, team driving, logistics coordination |
| Pre-operational vehicle inspections (PMCS) | DOT pre-trip inspections, commercial vehicle safety |
| Load planning and cargo securement | Freight handling, weight distribution, DOT compliance |
| Defensive driving, blackout operations | Advanced defensive driving, hazardous conditions |
| GPS navigation, map reading, route planning | Trip planning, route optimization, GPS fleet systems |
| Radio communications | Fleet communication, dispatch coordination |
| Vehicle maintenance (operator-level) | Basic truck maintenance, troubleshooting |
| Hazmat cargo transport | Hazmat endorsement, tanker endorsement |

**Leadership and Soft Skills:**

- **Safety Focus:** Drove thousands of miles without accidents; understood consequences of errors
- **Reliability:** Showed up on time, every time, regardless of conditions
- **Problem Solving:** Handled vehicle breakdowns, route changes, mission adjustments
- **Stress Management:** Maintained composure during convoys, time-critical missions, threats
- **Attention to Detail:** Ensured proper paperwork, load securement, inspection procedures
- **Teamwork:** Coordinated with other drivers, convoy commanders, unit leadership
- **Physical Stamina:** Worked long hours, physically demanding tasks, extreme environments
- **Discipline:** Followed regulations, maintained standards, took pride in performance

## Top Civilian Career Paths for 88M Operators

### 1. CDL Class A Truck Driver (Over-the-Road / Long-Haul)

**What you'll do:** Drive tractor-trailer combinations across the country, delivering freight for retailers, manufacturers, and logistics companies. Spend 2-3 weeks on the road, then home for 3-4 days. Load, secure, and deliver cargo safely and on-time.

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level OTR driver (first year):** $55,000-$70,000
- **Experienced driver (3-5 years):** $70,000-$85,000
- **Top performers (5+ years, clean record):** $80,000-$95,000+
- **Team drivers (two drivers, double miles):** $90,000-$120,000+

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** You've driven bigger, heavier, and more complex vehicles in worse conditions than civilian highways. You understand defensive driving, load securement, vehicle inspections, and operating under pressure. Civilian trucking is easier—better roads, better trucks, no IEDs.

**Companies actively hiring:**
Schneider National, Werner Enterprises, Swift Transportation, J.B. Hunt, Knight Transportation, Crete Carrier, CRST, Prime Inc, TMC Transportation, Maverick Transportation, Roehl Transport, Stevens Transport, U.S. Xpress, PAM Transport, Western Express

**Sign-on bonuses:** $5,000-$15,000 depending on experience and company

**Certifications needed:**
- **CDL Class A license** ($3,000-$8,000 or $0 with company-sponsored training)
- **Medical certification** ($75-$150)
- **Clean driving record** (companies check civilian and military records)

**Reality check:** OTR trucking means you're away from home 2-3 weeks at a time. You'll sleep in the truck, eat on the road, and work irregular hours. It's not for everyone. But the pay is solid, jobs are plentiful, and you control your career. If you want home time, pursue local or regional routes after gaining experience.

**Average miles per week:** 2,500-3,000 miles (OTR)

**Pay structure:** Most companies pay per mile ($0.45-$0.65 per mile for experienced drivers). Some pay hourly ($18-$28/hour) or salary.

### 2. CDL Class A Local / Regional Driver (Home Daily or Weekly)

**What you'll do:** Drive routes within 200-500 mile radius, delivering to stores, warehouses, or job sites. Home daily or multiple times per week. Often involves physical loading/unloading (unlike OTR).

**Salary ranges:**
- **Local delivery driver:** $55,000-$75,000
- **Regional driver (home weekends):** $60,000-$80,000
- **LTL (less-than-truckload) driver:** $65,000-$90,000
- **Dedicated route driver:** $60,000-$85,000

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** Local driving requires more backing, maneuvering, and customer interaction. Your military precision, safety focus, and customer service (working with units and leadership) translate well.

**Companies actively hiring:**
Old Dominion Freight Line, FedEx Freight, XPO Logistics, YRC Freight, Estes Express, ABF Freight, UPS, Sysco, US Foods, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart Transportation (private fleet), Home Depot Transportation, Lowe's Transportation

**Salary structure:** Often hourly ($22-$32/hour) with overtime, or salary with bonuses

**Reality check:** Local/regional driving typically pays $5K-$15K less than OTR but offers better lifestyle. You're home daily or on weekends. Physical demands are higher—expect lifting, loading, hand-trucking freight. LTL drivers (Old Dominion, FedEx Freight) earn top pay ($70K-$90K) but work hard—multiple stops, dock work, precise scheduling.

**Best for:** Veterans who want stability, home time, and consistent schedules over maximum income.

### 3. Specialized CDL Driver (Tanker, Flatbed, Hazmat, Heavy Haul)

**What you'll do:** Haul specialized freight requiring additional endorsements and skills. Tanker drivers haul liquids (fuel, chemicals, milk). Flatbed drivers haul construction materials, equipment, and oversized loads. Heavy haul drivers transport construction equipment, industrial machinery, and oversize freight.

**Salary ranges:**
- **Tanker driver:** $65,000-$90,000
- **Flatbed driver:** $65,000-$95,000
- **Heavy haul / oversize driver:** $75,000-$110,000
- **Hazmat driver (fuel, chemicals):** $70,000-$95,000

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** Many of you operated fuel tankers (M978 HEMTT tanker) or transported hazmat in the military. You understand the regulations, risks, and precision required. Civilian employers pay premium for experienced tanker and hazmat drivers.

**Companies actively hiring:**
**Tanker:** Schneider (bulk tanker division), Quality Carriers, Kenan Advantage Group, Groendyke Transport, Indian River Transport
**Flatbed:** TMC Transportation, Maverick Transportation, Melton Truck Lines, Boyd Brothers, Roehl Transport (flatbed division)
**Heavy Haul:** Landstar, Bennett Motor Express, Lone Star Transportation, Perdue Transportation

**Certifications needed:**
- CDL Class A with **Tanker endorsement** (written test, $10-$50)
- **Hazmat endorsement** (TSA background check + written test, $100-$150)
- **TWIC card** (if hauling to ports) - $125

**Reality check:** Specialized loads pay more but require additional skills. Flatbed involves tarping, strapping, and securing loads in all weather—physically demanding. Tanker requires understanding surge, rollover risk, and product handling. Heavy haul involves permits, escorts, and route planning. Higher pay reflects higher skill and responsibility.

### 4. Owner-Operator (Buy Your Own Truck)

**What you'll do:** Own and operate your own truck, contracting with carriers or finding your own freight. You're your own boss but responsible for all expenses—truck payment, fuel, maintenance, insurance, taxes.

**Earnings potential:**
- **Gross revenue:** $150,000-$250,000 per year
- **Operating expenses:** $60,000-$125,000 (40-50% of gross)
- **Net income (take-home):** $80,000-$150,000

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** You understand vehicle maintenance, operational costs, trip planning, and self-discipline. Owner-operators who succeed are disciplined, business-savvy, and willing to work hard. Your military work ethic gives you an edge.

**Path to owner-operator:**
1. **Drive company truck 2-3 years** (build experience, save money, establish credit)
2. **Buy truck** ($40,000-$150,000 depending on new vs. used; typically finance)
3. **Contract with carrier or find freight** (lease to carrier vs. own authority)
4. **Manage business** (track expenses, maintain truck, find loads, handle paperwork)

**Reality check:** Owner-operators can earn significantly more than company drivers—but also bear all risk. Truck breaks down? You pay. Freight slows? You earn less. Fuel prices spike? You absorb it. Many owner-operators fail within the first 2 years due to poor financial management or unexpected expenses. Don't rush into ownership—drive for a company first, learn the business, save capital, then transition.

**Best for:** Disciplined veterans with business sense, savings, and willingness to manage their own operation.

### 5. Transportation Coordinator / Dispatcher

**What you'll do:** Plan routes, coordinate drivers, schedule shipments, track deliveries, and solve problems. Office-based role requiring communication, organization, and logistics knowledge.

**Salary ranges:**
- **Dispatch coordinator:** $45,000-$60,000
- **Transportation planner:** $55,000-$75,000
- **Logistics coordinator:** $60,000-$80,000
- **Fleet manager:** $70,000-$95,000

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** You understand the driver's perspective, operational challenges, route planning, and communication. Dispatchers who've driven trucks are more effective because they know the realities of the road.

**Companies actively hiring:**
All major trucking companies, freight brokers (C.H. Robinson, XPO, TQL, Echo Global Logistics), 3PL companies, corporate transportation departments

**Certifications that help:**
- **Transportation Management Certificate** ($500-$1,500)
- **Logistics certifications** (CLA, CLT - $1,200-$1,800)

**Reality check:** Dispatching is less physical, home every night, but can be stressful. You're managing 20-50 drivers, solving problems, handling customer complaints, and balancing tight schedules. Good dispatchers are worth their weight in gold—companies pay well for effective coordinators.

**Best for:** 88M operators who are tired of driving but want to stay in transportation, have strong communication skills, and enjoy problem-solving.

### 6. Fleet Manager / Safety Director

**What you'll do:** Manage company fleet operations, ensure DOT compliance, oversee driver training, maintain safety standards, manage vehicle maintenance, and optimize fleet efficiency.

**Salary ranges:**
- **Fleet coordinator:** $55,000-$75,000
- **Fleet manager:** $70,000-$95,000
- **Safety director:** $75,000-$100,000
- **Director of transportation:** $90,000-$130,000

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** You've managed vehicle fleets (motor pool), conducted inspections, enforced safety standards, and trained personnel. Your military logistics and safety experience translate directly to civilian fleet management.

**Companies actively hiring:**
All companies with vehicle fleets: Amazon, FedEx, UPS, Ryder, Penske, corporate fleets (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart), municipalities, utility companies, construction companies

**Certifications that help:**
- **Certified Director of Safety (CDS)** - $1,500-$3,000
- **DOT Compliance certifications**
- **Fleet Management Certificate**

**Reality check:** Fleet management is an office/shop role requiring oversight, compliance knowledge, and leadership. You're responsible for DOT audits, accident investigations, driver performance, vehicle condition, and cost control. Strong leadership and organizational skills required.

**Best for:** Senior 88M NCOs with leadership experience who want management careers.

### 7. CDL Instructor / Driver Trainer

**What you'll do:** Train new CDL students or company drivers, conduct road tests, evaluate performance, teach classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction.

**Salary ranges:**
- **Company driver trainer (ride-along):** $60,000-$80,000
- **CDL instructor (school):** $45,000-$65,000
- **Lead instructor / school manager:** $60,000-$85,000

**Why 88M Operators succeed:** You've trained soldiers on military vehicles. Teaching civilians to drive trucks requires patience, communication, and technical knowledge—all of which you developed in the Army.

**Companies actively hiring:**
CDL training schools (nationwide), trucking companies (internal training programs), community colleges (CDL programs)

**Certifications needed:**
- **CDL with clean record**
- **State CDL instructor certification** (requirements vary by state)
- **Teaching experience** (military instructor experience counts)

**Reality check:** CDL instruction pays less than driving but offers home time, consistent schedule, and job satisfaction. You're helping people start careers. Many instructors are former drivers who want less road time and more stability.

**Best for:** 88M operators who enjoy teaching and mentoring.

## Required Certifications & Training (With Costs and ROI)

### High Priority (Get These First)

**1. CDL Class A License**

**Cost:** $3,000-$8,000 (private CDL school); $0 (company-sponsored training)

**Time to complete:** 3-8 weeks (full-time school); 3-4 months (company training with commitment)

**Why it matters:** Required to drive tractor-trailer combinations. Without CDL Class A, you can't access $55K-$95K driving jobs.

**ROI:** Immediate. First-year earnings of $55K-$70K cover training cost within 2-3 months.

**Where to get it:**
- **Company-sponsored training:** Schneider, Werner, Swift, Prime, CRST (free training but require 9-12 month commitment; early departure = repay tuition)
- **Private CDL schools:** Check your state's approved CDL schools (typically $3K-$5K)
- **Community colleges:** Many offer CDL programs eligible for GI Bill ($0 cost)
- **"Troops to Truckers" programs:** Many states let veterans with military driving experience skip skills test

**Important:** Most states allow 88M operators to use military driving experience to waive CDL skills test. You still take written exams but skip the road test. Contact your state DMV/licensing office to verify requirements.

**2. DOT Medical Card**

**Cost:** $75-$150

**Time to complete:** 1-hour appointment

**Why it matters:** Required to operate commercial vehicles. Must be renewed every 2 years (or annually if certain health conditions).

**Where to get it:** Certified DOT medical examiners (search FMCSA National Registry)

**3. Tanker Endorsement**

**Cost:** $10-$50 (written test fee)

**Time to complete:** Study 1-2 weeks, take written test

**Why it matters:** Required to haul liquid tankers (fuel, milk, chemicals). Opens $65K-$90K tanker driving jobs.

**ROI:** Strong. Tanker drivers earn $10K-$20K more than dry van drivers.

**4. Hazmat Endorsement**

**Cost:** $100-$150 (TSA background check + written test)

**Time to complete:** 4-6 weeks (background check processing)

**Why it matters:** Required to haul hazardous materials. Many loads require hazmat endorsement, limiting drivers who can haul them.

**ROI:** Excellent. Hazmat endorsement increases salary $5K-$15K and opens more job opportunities.

**Note:** Requires TSA security threat assessment and fingerprinting. Recent military background helps clearance process.

### Medium Priority (Career Advancement)

**5. TWIC Card (Transportation Worker Identification Credential)**

**Cost:** $125.25 (new); $117.25 (renewal)

**Time to complete:** 3-5 weeks

**Why it matters:** Required for port access—necessary if hauling freight to/from seaports or secure facilities.

**Where to get it:** TSA enrollment centers (online application, in-person appointment)

**6. Doubles/Triples Endorsement**

**Cost:** $10-$25 (written test)

**Why it matters:** Allows pulling multiple trailers. Some LTL companies require this endorsement.

**ROI:** Moderate. Opens additional job options but not essential for most drivers.

**7. ELDT (Entry Level Driver Training) Certification**

**Requirement:** Mandatory as of February 2022 for all new CDL drivers

**What it is:** Theory and behind-the-wheel training from FMCSA-approved providers

**Where to get it:** CDL schools, company training programs (automatically included in training)

### Advanced / Specialized

**8. Certified Director of Safety (CDS)**

**Cost:** $1,500-$3,000

**Why it matters:** For fleet safety director positions. Demonstrates professional safety management knowledge.

**ROI:** Strong for management positions ($75K-$100K)

**9. Certified Transportation Professional (CTP)**

**Cost:** $1,000-$2,000

**Why it matters:** Logistics and transportation management credential for coordinator and manager roles.

## Resume Translation: Military to Civilian

Stop writing "88M Motor Transport Operator" and assuming civilians understand.

**Instead of:** "Served as 88M Motor Transport Operator"

**Write:** "Professional heavy vehicle operator with 5 years operating 10-ton cargo trucks, fuel tankers, and tactical vehicles in diverse environments including combat zones"

### 10 Powerful Resume Bullet Points

1. **"Operated heavy military vehicles (HEMTT, LMTV, PLS) totaling 50,000+ miles including 15,000+ combat convoy miles with zero accidents or safety violations"**

2. **"Led convoy operations coordinating 12-vehicle convoys transporting $20M+ in equipment across 2,000+ miles of hostile territory with 100% mission success"**

3. **"Conducted 1,000+ pre-operational vehicle inspections following military safety protocols, identifying and resolving mechanical issues preventing vehicle failures"**

4. **"Transported hazardous materials (fuel, ammunition, explosives) following DOT and military regulations with zero spills or compliance violations"**

5. **"Trained and supervised 8 junior drivers on vehicle operations, safety procedures, and convoy tactics, reducing accidents by 75%"**

6. **"Executed defensive driving techniques including blackout operations, evasive maneuvers, and threat response procedures in high-risk environments"**

7. **"Maintained perfect safety record across 50,000+ miles and 5,000+ hours of heavy vehicle operation in extreme weather conditions (desert, mountains, ice)"**

8. **"Loaded and secured cargo using proper weight distribution and tie-down procedures, transporting 500+ tons of equipment with zero load shifts or damage"**

10. **"Coordinated with air support, infantry units, and logistics personnel to execute time-critical transportation missions with 100% on-time delivery rate"**

**Key principles:**
- Quantify everything: miles, hours, convoys, cargo weight
- Emphasize safety: zero accidents, perfect record, compliance
- Show leadership: trained personnel, led convoys, supervised operations
- Translate jargon: "HEMTT" = "10-ton cargo truck"; "PMCS" = "preventive maintenance"

### Questions to Ask Companies During Interviews

1. **"What's the average weekly miles for your drivers?"** (Determines pay)
2. **"What's the pay structure: per mile, hourly, or salary?"**
3. **"How much home time do drivers get?"** (OTR: 3-4 days per month; Regional: weekends; Local: daily)
4. **"What's the truck equipment like?"** (Automatic transmission, APU, amenities)
5. **"Do you offer sign-on bonuses, and what are the terms?"**
6. **"What benefits do you provide?"** (Health insurance, 401k, paid time off)
7. **"Do you offer tuition reimbursement or continuing education?"**
8. **"What's your safety rating and company culture?"**
9. **"Can I speak with one of your veteran drivers?"**
10. **"What's the typical career progression?"**

### Red Flags to Avoid

- **High turnover companies:** Research turnover rates (above 100% is red flag)
- **Forced dispatch to unsafe areas:** Reputable companies don't force drivers into unsafe situations
- **Hidden fees:** Watch for truck lease scams or excessive fees
- **Unrealistic income promises:** "$100K first year!" is usually misleading
- **Poor safety ratings:** Check FMCSA safety ratings online

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Rushing into owner-operator without experience

**Mistake:** Buying a truck immediately after getting CDL to "make big money."

**Fix:** Drive for a company 2-3 years first. Learn the business, save money, understand costs before taking on $100K+ truck loan.

### 2. Choosing highest starting pay over best company

**Mistake:** Taking $0.50/mile from sketchy company instead of $0.45/mile from reputable carrier.

**Fix:** Research company reputation on TruckersReport.com, Google reviews. Lower starting pay with better company = more miles, better treatment, long-term earnings.

### 3. Signing long-term contracts without reading fine print

**Mistake:** Signing 12-month commitment with company-sponsored training, then quitting and owing $6,000-$8,000.

**Fix:** Read contracts carefully. Understand commitment terms. If you sign training contract, plan to fulfill it.

### 4. Not managing finances on variable income

**Mistake:** Getting paid $1,500 one week, $800 next week, and not budgeting for low-pay weeks.

**Fix:** Trucking pay varies by miles, weather, freight availability. Budget conservatively. Save during high-pay weeks for low-pay weeks.

### 5. Neglecting health and fitness

**Mistake:** Eating truck stop food, sitting 10 hours daily, gaining 40 pounds first year.

**Fix:** Bring healthy food, exercise at rest stops, prioritize sleep. Trucking is physically demanding—maintain fitness or burn out.

### 6. Not understanding tax implications for owner-operators

**Mistake:** Earning $180K gross as owner-operator but not setting aside 25-30% for taxes, then owing $45K+ to IRS.

**Fix:** Hire accountant or use trucking-specific tax software. Set aside taxes quarterly. Deduct all legitimate business expenses.

### 7. Isolating yourself on the road

**Mistake:** Going weeks without meaningful human contact, leading to depression or burnout.

**Fix:** Call family daily, connect with other drivers, use veteran trucker groups online, plan home time strategically.

## Success Stories: 88M Veterans in Trucking

### Carlos, 25, E-4, 4 years → OTR Driver at Schneider ($72K)

Carlos separated after one enlistment, used his state's Troops to Truckers program to get CDL skills test waived, passed written tests, and got his Class A CDL for $120 (testing fees only—no school needed). Schneider hired him immediately with $7,500 sign-on bonus. First year he earned $62K learning routes and building reputation. Year two: $72K with safe driving bonuses. Plans to go local after 3 years for better home time.

**His advice:** "Use Troops to Truckers if your state has it. I saved $5,000 on CDL school because my military driving counted. Schneider treated me well—good equipment, responsive dispatch, consistent miles. OTR isn't forever, but it's solid money and you can transition to local routes after gaining experience."

### Jennifer, 29, E-5, 6 years → Walmart Private Fleet Driver ($94K)

Jennifer drove tactical vehicles for 6 years, got her CDL through company-sponsored training with Werner, drove OTR for 3 years building her record, then applied to Walmart Transportation. Walmart requires 2+ years safe driving and puts drivers through rigorous 6-week training. She now drives dedicated Walmart routes, home twice per week, earns $94K with benefits. Best trucking job in the industry.

**Her advice:** "Put in your time with a starter company, build a clean safety record, then pursue private fleet jobs. Walmart, Costco, Sysco, US Foods—they pay $85K-$110K but require experience and spotless records. It's worth the wait."

### Mike, 33, E-6, 8 years → Owner-Operator ($125K net)

Mike drove company trucks for 4 years after the Army, saved $40K, bought a used Freightliner with 300K miles for $65,000 financed. He leased onto Landstar (carrier that finds loads for owner-operators). First year as owner-operator was tough—unexpected repairs, slow freight, learning business side. Year two he netted $125K gross $215K, expenses $90K). Now considering buying second truck and hiring driver.

**His advice:** "Don't jump into owner-operator too fast. I'm glad I waited 4 years. I knew the business, had savings for emergencies, and understood what I was getting into. It's more money but also more stress and risk. You have to love the business, not just want bigger paychecks."
