# Erectile Dysfunction Secondary to Medications: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Medications are recognized cause
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Rating if approved:** 0% with Special Monthly Compensation (SMC-K)
- **SMC-K Value:** $138.80/month additional (2025)
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected condition, medication history, ED diagnosis, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** High (70%+) with proper documentation

Many medications prescribed for service-connected conditions cause erectile dysfunction as a side effect. If you've developed ED after starting medications for a service-connected condition, you have grounds for a secondary claim that includes valuable SMC-K compensation.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition can result from treatment for a service-connected condition, including medication side effects.

For ED secondary to medications:
- You must have a service-connected condition
- Medications for that condition cause or worsen ED
- Medical evidence must establish the medication connection

## Medications That Cause ED

### PTSD/Mental Health Medications (Most Common)

**SSRIs (Very High ED Rates):**
- Sertraline (Zoloft) - 40-70% ED rates
- Fluoxetine (Prozac)
- Paroxetine (Paxil)
- Citalopram (Celexa)
- Escitalopram (Lexapro)

**SNRIs:**
- Venlafaxine (Effexor)
- Duloxetine (Cymbalta)

**Other Antidepressants:**
- Mirtazapine
- Trazodone (paradoxically can help or hurt)

**Antipsychotics:**
- Quetiapine (Seroquel)
- Risperidone (Risperdal)
- Olanzapine (Zyprexa)

**Benzodiazepines:**
- May affect libido and function

### Blood Pressure Medications

**Beta Blockers:**
- Metoprolol
- Atenolol
- Propranolol

**Thiazide Diuretics:**
- Hydrochlorothiazide

### Pain Medications

**Opioids:**
- Cause hormonal changes affecting ED
- Decrease testosterone

**Some NSAIDs:**
- Indirectly through other effects

### Other Medications

**Prazosin:** Sometimes causes ED
**Finasteride/Dutasteride:** For prostate
**Antiseizure medications:** Some affect sexual function

## VA Rating for ED

ED is rated under 38 CFR § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 0% | ED without penile deformity |
| 20% | Deformity of penis with loss of erectile power |

**Most veterans receive 0%** because ED without deformity doesn't meet 20% criteria.

**BUT: Special Monthly Compensation (SMC-K)**

ED qualifies for SMC-K at $138.80/month (2025) for "loss of use of a creative organ."

**SMC-K is added directly to your compensation**, not subject to VA math.

**Total Value:**
- Monthly: $138.80
- Annual: $1,665.60
- 10 years: $16,656
- 20 years: $33,312

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition
- Service connection documentation
- Complete medication history with dates
- Documentation of when each medication started

#### For Your Secondary Condition (ED)
- Formal ED diagnosis
- Treatment records
- ED medication history (Viagra, Cialis, etc.)
- Timeline of ED onset relative to medications

### Medication Timeline (Critical)

Document:
- Each medication prescribed for service-connected condition
- Start dates
- Dosages
- Known sexual side effects (from package insert)
- When ED symptoms began

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Urologist or physician
2. **Record review statement**
3. **ED diagnosis**
4. **Medication review** - Specific medications and their ED effects
5. **Causal statement** - "At least as likely as not" language
6. **Temporal correlation**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including medication history. [Veteran] is service-connected for PTSD at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] has a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.*

*Medication History:*
*- Sertraline 150mg: [start date] to present ([X] years)*
*- Quetiapine 200mg: [start date] to present ([X] years)*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] erectile dysfunction is at least as likely as not (50% probability or greater) caused by medications prescribed for service-connected PTSD.*

*Medical Rationale: Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs are well-documented to cause sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, in 40-70% of users. The mechanism involves serotonin's inhibitory effect on dopamine and norepinephrine pathways involved in sexual function, as well as peripheral effects on nitric oxide-mediated erection.*

*[Veteran's] records document ED onset approximately [X] months after initiating sertraline therapy, consistent with medication-induced sexual dysfunction. The temporal relationship supports causation.*

*FDA prescribing information for sertraline lists sexual dysfunction, including ED, as a common adverse effect."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Causative Medications
- Review all medications for service-connected conditions
- Note which have ED as known side effect
- Document timing of medication starts

### Step 2: Get ED Diagnosed
- See urologist or primary care
- Get formal ED diagnosis
- Begin treatment if appropriate (documents condition)

### Step 3: Create Medication Timeline
- When each medication started
- When ED began
- Correlation between the two

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter
- Find urologist or physician
- Provide medication history
- Request letter linking medications to ED
- Cost: $500-$1,000

### Step 5: File Claim
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Link to medications for service-connected condition
- Request SMC-K
- Upload evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam
- May or may not be scheduled
- If scheduled, be prepared to discuss medication history

### Step 7: Decision
- Should receive 0% + SMC-K
- SMC-K added to monthly payment

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not claiming at all** - ED is personal but legitimate claim

2. **No medication timeline** - Essential to show temporal relationship

3. **Missing FDA warning information** - Include package insert data

4. **Not requesting SMC-K** - Explicitly request this compensation

5. **Weak nexus** - Must cite specific medications and their effects

6. **Thinking 0% isn't worth it** - SMC-K makes this valuable

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: SSRI-Induced ED

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, 70% PTSD
- On sertraline 150mg for 5 years
- ED developed 6 months after starting medication

**Evidence:**
- Medication timeline
- ED diagnosis
- Nexus from urologist citing SSRI effects
- FDA prescribing information

**Outcome:** 0% ED + SMC-K
**Additional Compensation:** $138.80/month

### Case Study 2: Multiple Medications

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran
- 50% PTSD (on sertraline)
- 10% hypertension (on metoprolol)
- ED from combined medication effects

**Evidence:**
- Both medications known to cause ED
- Nexus addressing combined effect
- Medication timeline

**Outcome:** 0% ED + SMC-K
**Additional Compensation:** $138.80/month

## How SMC-K Works

**SMC-K is flat additional payment:**
- Not affected by your combined rating
- Added directly to monthly check
- Not subject to VA math

**Example:**
- Current combined rating: 70% = $1,716.28
- Add SMC-K: $1,716.28 + $138.80 = $1,855.08/month

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No current ED diagnosis"** - Get formal diagnosis
2. **"No nexus to medications"** - Need stronger connection
3. **"ED from other causes"** - Address other factors in nexus

### Strengthening Your Claim

1. **Urologist evaluation** - Specialist opinion
2. **Complete medication timeline** - All relevant medications
3. **FDA package insert information** - Official documentation
4. **Temporal correlation** - ED started after medication
