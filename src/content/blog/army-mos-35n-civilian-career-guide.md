## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 35N Signals Intelligence Analysts transitioning out—you have some of the most technical and in-demand skills in the intelligence community. Your **signals intelligence collection and analysis, SIGINT systems operation, electronic warfare support, technical analysis of communications and non-communications signals, cyber SIGINT operations, and ability to identify threats from intercepted electronic signals** make you extremely valuable to government agencies and defense contractors. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$90,000-$125,000** with NSA or defense contractors, scaling to **$125,000-$165,000** with mid-career positions, and **$165,000-$200,000+** for senior technical SIGINT roles or cybersecurity positions. Your TS/SCI clearance with technical SIGINT background is worth **$25,000-$40,000** in salary premium.

As a 35N, you didn't just "monitor radios." You operated sophisticated SIGINT collection systems to intercept, locate, and analyze foreign communications and electronic signals. You identified threat networks through technical analysis of communications patterns. You conducted signals analysis to determine enemy capabilities, intentions, and locations. You operated direction-finding equipment and identified enemy emitters. You produced SIGINT reports that directly supported tactical and strategic operations. You worked with NSA systems and procedures. That's technical intelligence, electronic warfare, signals analysis, cyber operations, and pattern recognition—all highly marketable skills.

The key advantage: NSA actively recruits 35N analysts. You've already worked NSA systems, understand SIGINT collection and analysis, and hold the required clearance. Defense contractors supporting NSA, USCYBERCOM, and tactical SIGINT operations need your expertise. Cybersecurity firms value your technical analysis skills. Your SIGINT background opens doors to six-figure technical intelligence careers that most people can't access.

## What Does a 35N Signals Intelligence Analyst Do?

As a 35N, you conducted SIGINT operations to identify, locate, and analyze foreign communications, non-communications emitters, and electronic signals. You operated SIGINT collection systems including receivers, direction-finding equipment, and technical analysis tools. You analyzed voice and non-voice communications to extract intelligence on enemy forces, locations, networks, and capabilities. You identified and tracked emitters through technical signal analysis and direction-finding operations. You produced SIGINT reports including time-sensitive reports on immediate threats, technical reports on enemy communications systems, and analytical products identifying threat networks.

Your responsibilities included monitoring specific targets using NSA tasking and reporting procedures, conducting technical analysis of communications and electronic warfare signals, operating and maintaining SIGINT collection equipment, performing geolocation of threat emitters, collaborating with other intelligence disciplines (HUMINT, GEOINT, CI) to develop comprehensive intelligence pictures, and supporting tactical operations with real-time SIGINT collection and reporting.

This role required technical proficiency with electronic systems, analytical thinking, attention to detail, understanding of communications theory and electronic warfare, ability to identify patterns in complex technical data, report writing skills, and TS/SCI clearance to handle NSA systems and SIGINT materials.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (preferred for many positions, technical degrees in EE, Computer Science, Math, or related fields highly valued)
- **Active TS/SCI clearance** (mandatory)
- **CI polygraph** (required for most NSA positions)
- **Technical certifications** (Security+, network+, or CISSP valued but not required)

**Reality check:**
NSA is Fort Meade, Maryland (primary campus) with smaller facilities in Georgia, Hawaii, Colorado, and Texas. Most SIGINT positions are at Fort Meade, which means living in Maryland (Baltimore-DC corridor). Cost of living is high but locality pay compensates.

NSA doesn't use GS pay scale—they use a pay band system with broader ranges and performance-based increases rather than automatic step raises. This means high performers advance faster and earn more.

Hiring process: 12-18 months including background investigation, CI polygraph, technical assessment, and clearance adjudication. NSA actively recruits military SIGINT professionals—your 35N background makes you highly competitive.

The mission is continuing SIGINT work at the strategic level—instead of supporting tactical operations, you're supporting national intelligence priorities. Work-life balance varies—some positions are shift work (24/7 operations), others are standard business hours. Overtime opportunities exist for those wanting additional income.

NSA offers excellent federal benefits: pension, TSP matching, comprehensive health insurance, professional development, and advanced technical training. Career progression is clear, and technical experts can advance without becoming managers.

**Best for:** 35N analysts who want to continue technical SIGINT mission, prefer government stability, and want to work at the highest levels of signals intelligence.

### Defense Contractor SIGINT Positions (high pay, fast hiring, familiar mission)

**Civilian job titles:**

Contracts typically last 3-5 years with options to extend. Contractors often work alongside NSA civilians doing identical work but earning 20-30% more. Trade-off is less job security—if contract ends or funding cuts, contractors leave first.

The work is meaningful—still supporting SIGINT collection and national security—but you're a contract employee. Benefits vary by company but most major contractors offer competitive packages.

Hiring is faster than federal government (2-4 months typically) because you already have the clearance and technical skills. Cleared SIGINT analysts are in high demand.

**Best for:** 35N analysts who want maximum salary, faster hiring than NSA, and flexibility to move between companies/contracts while continuing SIGINT mission.
