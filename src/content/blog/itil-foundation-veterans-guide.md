## What Is ITIL Foundation Certification?

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is the world's most widely adopted framework for IT service management (ITSM). ITIL Foundation certification validates your understanding of key ITSM concepts, terminology, and the ITIL service value system.

The current version is ITIL 4, which modernized the framework to incorporate agile, DevOps, and digital transformation concepts while maintaining the best practices from previous versions.

## Why Veterans Excel in ITSM

Military operations align perfectly with ITIL concepts:

**Service delivery mindset:** Military units provide services to higher headquarters and supported units. ITIL formalizes this approach for IT.

**Process discipline:** Military operations run on standard operating procedures. ITIL provides the same structure for IT operations.

**Continuous improvement:** After-Action Reviews (AARs) are lessons learned. ITIL's continual improvement practice uses the same concept.

**Incident management:** When systems go down, you respond. ITIL incident management mirrors military response procedures.

**Change management:** Military units don't make changes without approval. ITIL change management follows the same principle.
