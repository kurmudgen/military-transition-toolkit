# How to Transition from Military to Sales: Career Guide for Veteran Salespeople

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Military leadership = direct sales ability.** You can transition to sales **immediately (0-6 months to first role).** **Cost: $0** (no certification needed). **Salary: $50K-$100K+ first year (base + commission), $100K-$200K within 3-5 years, $200K-$500K+ as top performer or sales manager.** High earning potential if you're good at sales.

**Your advantage:** You've already been persuading people, managing teams, closing deals (military operations are deals with resources and outcomes). You understand commitment, discipline, follow-through. Those are sales fundamentals.

## Why Sales Needs Veterans

Sales is about relationships, credibility, and closing deals. Veterans are naturals.

**Specific advantages:**
- **Credibility:** Military service = instant trust and respect
- **Discipline:** You follow process, track metrics, achieve targets
- **Relationship-building:** Leadership = relationship management
- **Handle rejection:** Military rejection is harsh; sales rejection is mild
- **Under pressure:** You make big decisions in chaos. Sales pressure is manageable.
- **Integrity:** People trust you. That's essential for long-term sales relationships
- **Work ethic:** You outwork civilians in competitive roles

## Step-by-Step Plan to Get Into Sales

### Phase 1: Assess Fit (Month 1)

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] Are you comfortable with rejection? (Critical for sales)
- [ ] Do you like building relationships?
- [ ] Can you handle variable income? (Commission-based)
- [ ] Are you competitive / driven by metrics?
- [ ] Do you prefer inside sales (phone/email) or outside sales (travel)?

**Reality check:**
- Sales is high-pressure (constant quotas)
- Rejection is constant (most calls don't convert)
- Income is variable (good months, slow months)
- You need thick skin and resilience

**If you're energized by competition and closure, sales is for you.**

### Phase 2: Research and Decide (Month 1)

**Decide:**
- [ ] Inside sales (B2B, phone-based) vs. Enterprise sales (travel, high-value)
- [ ] Technical sales vs. general sales
- [ ] What industry interests you (tech, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.)

**Research:**
- Talk to 5 salespeople in your target industry
- Ask about: Income potential, lifestyle, challenges, growth
- Understand sales culture in that industry
- Identify companies you want to sell for

### Phase 3: Apply (Month 2-3)

**Where to find sales jobs:**
- LinkedIn (search "sales representative" or "account executive")
- Indeed.com
- Company career pages (tech, finance, manufacturing, etc.)

**Target companies:**
- Tech (Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, startups)
- Financial services
- Manufacturing (B2B)
- SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) companies

**Application strategy:**

- Cover letter: Explain why military leadership = sales ability

**Military advantage:** Many companies actively recruit military for sales (discipline, credibility)

**Timeline:** 1-4 weeks to interviews, 2-4 weeks to offer

### Phase 4: Interview (Month 3-4)

**What they'll ask:**
- Tell me about yourself (prepare 2-minute story)
- Why sales? (Explain your interest)
- Tell me about a time you overcame objection (use military example)
- What's your sales process? (You might not know yet—learn basic process)
- Role-play scenario (they'll give you objection, you respond)

**Preparation:**
- Study the company (what do they sell)
- Learn basic sales terminology (pipeline, close rate, quota, commission, etc.)
- Practice role-play (friend plays customer, you sell to them)
- Prepare questions for them (show interest)

**Your advantage:** Military background = automatic credibility. Just be yourself.

### Phase 5: First Sales Job (Month 4+)

## Real Veteran Success Stories

### Story 1: Infantry Officer to B2B Sales Rep

**Major David Chen (Army, 10 years Infantry Officer)**
- **Background:** Led troops, persuaded people, made high-stakes decisions
- **Timeline:** ETS age 32, decided sales appealed to him
- **Path:**

**Why successful:** Military leadership = sales skills. Persuasion skills transferred. Competitive mindset = wants to win quota. Built strong client relationships.

**Key lesson:** "I thought sales was smarmy. Turns out, I was already doing it in the Army—persuading people, closing operations. Sales is just more explicit about the deal."

### Story 2: NCO to Enterprise Sales

**SFC Maria Lopez (Army, 12 years NCO)**
- **Background:** Managed 30 people, handled complex logistics, negotiated with contractors
- **Timeline:** ETS age 34
- **Path:**

  - Month 4: Started as Account Executive at enterprise software company, $100K base
- **Year 1:** $120K (ramp period, learning enterprise sales, 2 large deals)
- **Year 2:** $180K (hitting quota, closing $2-3M in revenue)
- **Year 3:** $240K (exceeding quota, managing $5M+ accounts)
- **Year 4:** $300K+ (top performer, company expanding territory for him)
- **Year 5:** Senior Account Executive / Account Director, $320K+

**Why successful:** Military background = trusted with large accounts. Relationship-building skills = enterprise clients love him. Risk tolerance = comfortable with variable income.

**Key lesson:** "Enterprise sales pays way better than inside sales, but it's harder and longer sales cycles. Worth the extra effort."

### Story 3: Support Role to Sales Manager

**Captain James Park (Air Force, 8 years, logistics/operations)**
- **Background:** Operations, not direct sales, but good with people and processes
- **Timeline:** ETS age 30
- **Path:**
  - Month 1-2: Applied to sales roles (realized he wanted management track)
  - Month 3: Started as Sales Development Rep (SDR—qualifies leads, not closing big deals), $45K base + small commission
  - Year 1: $65K (learned sales process, industry)
  - Year 2: Promoted to Sales Rep (closing deals), $80K base + commissions, Total $110K
  - Year 3: Promoted to Senior Rep, $100K + commission, Total $155K

  - Year 5: Senior Manager (team of 10), $160K base + $60K bonus = $220K

**Why took longer path:** Started lower (SDR) to learn business thoroughly. Leadership track appealed to him. Now managing team, happier than individual contributor.

**Key lesson:** "I started lower because I didn't have sales background. But learning thoroughly helped me manage better. Moving to leadership was right call for me."

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge #1: "I'm Worried About Rejection"

**Reality:** Sales is rejection-heavy. Most calls don't convert.

**Perspective:** Military rejection is harsh (orders, life/death). Sales rejection is mild (they just say no). You can handle this.

**Solution:**
- Reframe rejection as data (they said no, learn why, move to next)
- Numbers game mindset (make 100 calls, 10 meetings, 2 deals = normal)
- Remember: You're not being rejected, your offer is

### Challenge #2: "Variable Income Seems Risky"

**Reality:** Commission-based income varies month-to-month.

**Solution:**
- Choose inside sales with base salary first (more stable)
- Enterprise sales pays better but more risk
- Build 6-month emergency fund before starting
- Expect ramp period (first 3-6 months might be below average)

### Challenge #3: "I Don't Have Sales Experience"

**Reality:** That's fine. Most sales reps start with no experience.

**Solution:**
- Company training covers basics
- You learn by doing
- Mentoring from senior rep helps
- First 6 months is learning curve

### Challenge #4: "I Don't Like the Aggressive Sales Culture"

**Reality:** Sales culture can be aggressive/competitive.

**Solution:**
- Some companies are less aggressive (healthcare, education, nonprofits)
- Inside sales is less aggressive than enterprise/field sales
- You can set your own tone with clients (build relationships, not just push sales)
- Find company culture that matches your style
