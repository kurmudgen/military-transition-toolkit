# Military to Aerospace Industry: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The aerospace industry offers veterans exceptional career opportunities with entry-level positions at $55,000-$80,000 and experienced engineers/technicians earning $100,000-$150,000+. Your military technical experience, security clearances, and understanding of defense systems provide significant advantages. Aerospace companies actively recruit veterans—defense contractors have especially strong veteran hiring. Most veterans can transition within 3-6 months, with security clearances providing immediate value.

## Why Veterans Excel in Aerospace

Military veterans, especially those with aviation, missile, or space backgrounds, have directly applicable aerospace experience. You've operated, maintained, or supported the systems these companies build.

Your understanding of military customer requirements is invaluable. Aerospace defense contractors need employees who understand military operations, requirements, and acquisition processes.

Security clearances open immediate doors. Defense aerospace requires cleared employees, and your existing clearance is a significant advantage.

Technical training from military service provides strong foundation. You've worked on complex aircraft, missile systems, and space assets—directly relevant aerospace experience.

Quality and safety discipline from military training aligns with aerospace's rigorous standards. You understand why procedures and quality matter in life-safety systems.

Your ability to work in structured, process-driven environments fits aerospace culture. AS9100 quality standards and regulatory requirements create environments similar to military operations.

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. Not Maintaining Clearance**
Your security clearance is extremely valuable in aerospace. Maintain it during transition.

**2. Undervaluing Military Technical Experience**
Your hands-on experience with military systems is directly relevant. Translate it effectively.

**3. Targeting Only Defense Contractors**
Commercial aerospace (Boeing commercial, Airbus) also offers excellent opportunities.

**4. Ignoring Manufacturing Locations**
Aerospace jobs are where the factories are. Be prepared to consider locations beyond major cities.

**5. Not Getting A&P If Applicable**
For aircraft mechanic roles, FAA A&P certification adds significant value.

**6. Overlooking Technician Roles**
Aerospace technician roles offer excellent pay and advancement. Don't focus only on engineering if you don't have the degree.

**7. Not Using SkillBridge**
Many aerospace companies participate in SkillBridge. Use this for hands-on transition experience.
