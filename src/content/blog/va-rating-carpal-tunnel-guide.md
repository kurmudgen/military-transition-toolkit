# VA Rating for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Complete Guide (2025)

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) affects thousands of veterans who performed repetitive hand and wrist movements during service. Whether from typing at a desk, working on vehicles, or operating equipment, CTS can be service-connected and rated from 10% to 70%.

If both hands are affected, you can receive separate ratings for each—potentially doubling your compensation. Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?

Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve, which runs through the carpal tunnel in your wrist, becomes compressed. This causes pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand and fingers (primarily thumb, index, middle, and part of ring finger).

### Common Symptoms

- Numbness or tingling in thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers
- Pain in wrist, hand, or forearm
- Weakness in hand
- Difficulty gripping objects
- Dropping things
- Symptoms worse at night
- Shaking hands to relieve symptoms
- "Pins and needles" sensation

### Military Activities That Cause CTS

- **Administrative/desk work**: Typing, computer use
- **Mechanical work**: Using hand tools, wrenching
- **Weapons maintenance**: Repetitive cleaning, assembly
- **Driving**: Gripping steering wheel for extended periods
- **Radio/communications operation**: Morse code, typing
- **Medical duties**: Using medical instruments
- **Loading/unloading**: Repetitive lifting and gripping
- **Operating heavy equipment**: Vibration exposure

## How the VA Rates Carpal Tunnel

CTS is rated under Diagnostic Code 8515 (median nerve paralysis). Ratings depend on severity and whether the dominant or non-dominant hand is affected.

### Rating Criteria

**Dominant Hand (Major):**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild incomplete paralysis | 10% |
| Moderate incomplete paralysis | 30% |
| Severe incomplete paralysis | 50% |
| Complete paralysis | 70% |

**Non-Dominant Hand (Minor):**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild incomplete paralysis | 10% |
| Moderate incomplete paralysis | 20% |
| Severe incomplete paralysis | 40% |
| Complete paralysis | 60% |

### Severity Definitions

**Mild:**
- Intermittent numbness/tingling
- Occasional symptoms
- No significant weakness
- Minimal functional impact

**Moderate:**
- More frequent or constant symptoms
- Noticeable weakness
- Some difficulty with fine motor tasks
- Dropping objects occasionally
- Impact on daily activities

**Severe:**
- Constant, severe symptoms
- Significant weakness
- Muscle atrophy (thenar muscles at base of thumb)
- Major functional limitations
- Can't grip effectively

**Complete Paralysis:**
- Unable to flex first two fingers
- Feeble thumb flexion
- Thenar atrophy
- Cannot make fist
- Index and middle finger extend only

## The Bilateral Factor

If both hands have carpal tunnel syndrome, you can be rated for each hand separately, and the VA applies the **bilateral factor**—a 10% increase to the combined value of bilateral upper extremity disabilities.

**Example: Bilateral Moderate CTS (dominant and non-dominant):**
- Dominant hand (moderate): 30%
- Non-dominant hand (moderate): 20%
- Combined before bilateral factor: 44%
- After bilateral factor: 44% + 4.4% = 48.4% → rounds to 50%

This is why claiming both hands matters if you have bilateral symptoms.

## Proving Service Connection

### Direct Service Connection

To prove CTS is directly connected to service:

**Evidence needed:**
1. Current diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome
2. In-service repetitive use or injury
3. Medical nexus connecting current CTS to service activities

**In-service evidence:**
- Service records showing job/MOS involving repetitive hand use
- Medical records with hand/wrist complaints
- Documentation of specific duties (typing, mechanical work, etc.)
- Buddy statements about job duties

**Common in-service causes:**
- Administrative MOSs (heavy typing)
- Mechanical/maintenance MOSs (hand tool use)
- Medical MOSs (surgical instruments)
- Communications MOSs (operating equipment)
- Infantry/combat arms (weapons handling)
- Any MOS with vibration exposure

### MOS-Based Arguments

Certain MOSs have strong built-in nexus arguments:

**71L/42A (Administrative Specialist)**: Years of typing
**91B (Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic)**: Constant hand tool use
**68W (Combat Medic)**: Repetitive medical procedures
**25 Series (Signal)**: Operating communications equipment
**88M (Motor Transport Operator)**: Gripping steering wheel, vibration

### Secondary Service Connection

CTS can be secondary to other conditions:

**Diabetes → CTS**
- Diabetes damages nerves and increases CTS risk
- Very common secondary claim

**Wrist/forearm injuries → CTS**
- Prior trauma can lead to CTS development

**Thyroid conditions → CTS**
- Hypothyroidism associated with CTS

**Obesity from service-connected conditions → CTS**
- Obesity is a risk factor for CTS

## The Importance of Nerve Conduction Studies

An EMG/nerve conduction study (NCS) is the gold standard for confirming CTS and documenting severity.

### What NCS Shows

- Confirms CTS diagnosis objectively
- Documents which nerve is affected
- Measures severity of nerve compression
- Provides objective evidence for rating

### Getting NCS Testing

Request through:
- VA neurology
- VA physiatry
- Private neurologist

Tell your doctor: "I have hand numbness and tingling. I'd like nerve conduction studies to document carpal tunnel syndrome."

### NCS Findings and Ratings

| NCS Finding | Typical Rating |
|-------------|----------------|
| Normal or borderline | May still get 10% with symptoms |
| Mild abnormality | 10% |
| Moderate abnormality | 20-30% |
| Severe abnormality | 40-50% |

## C&P Exam for Carpal Tunnel

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about symptoms in each hand
3. **Perform Phalen's test** (wrist flexion)
4. **Perform Tinel's test** (tapping over carpal tunnel)
5. Test grip strength
6. Check for thenar atrophy
7. Test sensation in fingers
8. Review any NCS results
9. Determine severity for each hand

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- Which hand(s) are affected?
- What symptoms do you have?
- How often do you experience them?
- Do symptoms wake you at night?
- Do you have weakness or difficulty gripping?
- Do you drop things?
- What activities make it worse?
- What did your job duties involve in the military?

### How to Answer

**Describe all symptoms:**
- "I have constant numbness in my thumb and first two fingers on both hands"
- "I drop things at least once a day"
- "I wake up 3-4 times per night with my hands completely numb"
- "I can't grip a jar lid or open bottles easily"

**Connect to service:**
- "As a 71L, I typed 8+ hours per day for 6 years"
- "As a mechanic, I used hand tools constantly for my entire enlistment"

**Don't minimize:**
If your symptoms are bad, say so. The difference between 10% and 30% is significant.

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Current diagnosis** of carpal tunnel syndrome
2. **Nerve conduction study/EMG** results
3. **Treatment records** (splints, injections, surgery)
4. **Physical exam findings** (positive Phalen's, Tinel's, weakness)

### Service Records

5. **MOS/job description** showing repetitive hand use
6. **Service treatment records** with any hand/wrist complaints
7. **Performance evaluations** mentioning typing, mechanical work, etc.

### Lay Evidence

8. **Personal statement** describing:
   - Military duties involving hand use
   - When symptoms started
   - Current symptoms for each hand
   - Functional impact

9. **Buddy statements** from:
   - Fellow service members describing your duties
   - Spouse/family describing your symptoms

## Surgery Considerations

### Pre-Surgery Ratings

If you haven't had surgery, you're rated based on current symptoms and NCS findings.

### Post-Surgery Ratings

After carpal tunnel release surgery:
- If successful with minimal residuals → may be rated 0-10%
- If unsuccessful with continued symptoms → rated based on residual severity
- Surgical scars may be separately ratable

### Should You Get Surgery Before Filing?

There's no requirement to have surgery. File based on your current condition. If you're considering surgery:
- Get your claim filed first
- Surgery results may lower your rating if successful
- Document pre-surgery severity

## Carpal Tunnel Secondary Conditions

If CTS is service-connected, consider:

### Depression/Anxiety
- Chronic pain affects mental health
- Loss of hand function is distressing

### Cervical Radiculopathy (or vice versa)
- Neck problems can coexist with CTS
- Sometimes confused with each other
- Can have both

## Common Denial Reasons and Solutions

### "No evidence of in-service repetitive use"
**Solution**: Detailed statement about job duties, buddy statements, MOS description showing hand-intensive work.

### "CTS attributed to post-service activities"
**Solution**: Nexus letter explaining military duties as the cause. Timeline showing symptoms began during or shortly after service.

### "Normal nerve conduction study"
**Solution**: CTS can exist with normal or borderline NCS. Symptoms and clinical findings still support diagnosis. Request repeat NCS if symptoms persist.

### "Condition too mild for compensable rating"
**Solution**: Detailed description of symptoms and functional impact. Ensure examiner knows about night symptoms, weakness, dropping things.

## Maximizing Your Rating

### 1. Claim Both Hands
If you have bilateral CTS, claim both. Bilateral factor adds to your rating.

### 2. Get Nerve Conduction Studies
Objective evidence is harder to deny. NCS documents severity.

### 3. Document Functional Impact
- How does CTS affect your work?
- What can't you do anymore?
- How does it affect daily activities?

### 4. Don't Forget Night Symptoms
Night symptoms are classic for CTS. Mention how often you wake up.

### 5. Note Any Muscle Atrophy
If the muscles at the base of your thumb have shrunk, that indicates severe CTS.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get CTS service-connected without medical records from service?
Yes. You can use MOS evidence, buddy statements, and nexus letter explaining how military duties caused CTS.

### Does it matter which hand is dominant?
Yes. Dominant hand gets higher ratings (30% moderate vs 20% non-dominant).

### What if I had surgery and it helped?
You're rated based on current residual symptoms. If surgery resolved symptoms, rating may be lower.

### Can CTS be secondary to diabetes?
Yes. Diabetes increases CTS risk. If you're service-connected for diabetes, CTS can be secondary.

### What's the average CTS rating?
Most veterans receive 10-20% per hand (mild to moderate). Higher ratings require documented weakness and/or severe NCS findings.

### Can I work with service-connected CTS?
Yes. Being service-connected doesn't mean you can't work. Rating reflects degree of impairment.
