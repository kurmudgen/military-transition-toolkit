# Missouri Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Missouri offers strong tax benefits for veterans, particularly for retirees and disabled veterans. If you're a veteran considering Missouri or already living here, understanding these benefits can save you thousands of dollars annually.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Missouri offers veterans:

- **Military retirement pay**: 100% exempt from state income tax (as of 2024)
- **Property tax credit**: Up to $1,100 annually for 100% disabled veterans (lower amounts for partial disability)
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Surviving spouse benefits**: Property tax exemption available for unremarried spouses
- **Business license exemption**: Available in some jurisdictions for disabled veterans
- **No estate or inheritance tax**: Missouri eliminated these in 2010

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $2,500-$4,500+ depending on income and property value.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Fully Exempt (Since 2024)

Missouri fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax. This exemption became complete in tax year 2024, making Missouri one of the most veteran-friendly states in the Midwest.

**What this means**:
- Retire with $30,000/year military pension? Keep all of it
- Retire with $50,000/year? Still keep every penny
- No age restrictions, no income limits, no phase-outs

Prior to 2024, Missouri offered partial exemptions that increased with age. Now, all military retirees benefit equally regardless of age.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $165/month for a 10% rating or $3,800+/month for 100% with dependents, you won't pay a dime in taxes on it.

### Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)

SBP payments are also exempt from Missouri state income tax. If you're receiving military survivor benefits, Missouri won't tax them.

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Missouri operates on a graduated income tax system:

**2024-2025 Tax Brackets**:
- **0%** on income up to $1,207
- **2%** on income between $1,207-$2,414
- **3%** on income between $2,414-$3,621
- **4%** on income between $3,621-$4,828
- **5%** on income between $4,828-$6,035
- **5.3%** on income over $6,035

**Standard deduction**: $12,550 (single), $25,100 (married filing jointly) for 2024

**Note**: Missouri's top rate of 5.3% is scheduled to phase down to 4.5% by 2026 through gradual reductions.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Benefits (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Missouri** | 100% exempt | 0-5.3% | $1,100 credit |
| Kansas | Partial exemption | 3.1-5.7% | Varies by county |
| Iowa | Partial ($6K-$12K exempt) | 4.4-5.7% | Varies |
| Arkansas | Partial ($6K exempt) | 2-4.7% | Full exemption |
| Illinois | 100% exempt | 4.95% flat | Limited exemption |
| Kentucky | Partial ($31K exempt) | 4% flat | Varies |
| Tennessee | N/A | No income tax | Limited exemption |

Missouri's combination of zero tax on military retirement and straightforward property tax credit makes it highly competitive, especially compared to Kansas and Iowa.

## Property Tax Credit for Disabled Veterans

### 100% Disabled Veterans - Up to $1,100 Annual Credit

If you're rated 100% Permanent and Total (P&T) by the VA, you're eligible for an annual property tax credit of up to **$1,100** on your primary residence.

**This is a credit, not an exemption**. You still pay your property tax bill, then claim the credit when filing your Missouri income tax return (or claim it directly if you don't owe income tax).

**Key details**:
- Credit amount: Up to $1,100 per year
- No property value cap
- Must be primary residence
- Must have 100% P&T rating

- **80% disabled**: Up to $660
- **70% disabled**: Up to $440

**Important**: To qualify for partial disability credits, you must have been awarded disability compensation by the VA for a service-connected disability. The rating letter from the VA is your proof.

### Surviving Spouse Property Tax Exemption

**Unremarried surviving spouses** of 100% disabled veterans or veterans who died in service may qualify for the same property tax credit benefits.

**Eligibility requirements**:
- Must be unremarried
- Must have been married to veteran at time of death
- Veteran was either 100% P&T or died from service-connected disability

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran retiring in Missouri vs. other states.

### Scenario: E-8 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $35,000
- VA disability: $45,000 (100% with dependents)
- Total: $80,000

**Home**: $250,000 (median for Missouri cities)
**Property tax**: ~$2,750/year (1.1% average)

### Missouri Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax credit | $1,100 | $22,000 |
| Military retirement (vs 5% state tax) | $1,750 | $35,000 |
| Free license plates | $25 | $500 |
| Hunting/fishing license | $31 | $620 |
| Motor fuel tax refund | $50 | $1,000 |
| State park admission | $50 | $1,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$3,006** | **$60,120** |

**Note**: This doesn't account for inflation or the income tax rate reduction to 4.5% by 2026, which would increase savings.

### Comparison: Missouri vs. Kansas

Same scenario, but in Kansas (which only partially exempts military retirement):

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Missouri | $22,000 | $35,000 | $60,120 |
| Kansas | Varies (less generous) | ~$15,000 (partial exemption) | ~$40,000 |

**Missouri advantage: $20,000+ over 20 years**

### Comparison: Missouri vs. Illinois

Illinois has no income tax but higher property taxes:

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Missouri | $22,000 | $35,000 | $60,120 |
| Illinois | Minimal | $35,000 | ~$40,000 |

**Missouri advantage: $20,000+ over 20 years** (plus lower overall property tax burden)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax credit every year?

**Yes**. The property tax credit must be claimed annually on your Missouri income tax return. You'll need to provide your property tax receipt and VA rating letter each year.

### What if I'm rated 100% but not Permanent & Total?

You should still qualify for the $1,100 credit based on your 100% rating. However, if your rating is subject to future re-evaluation, you'll need to maintain that rating to continue receiving the credit.

### Can I get both the property tax credit and the senior citizen credit?

No. If you qualify for multiple property tax credits (veteran, senior, disabled person), you can only claim the highest one. For most 100% disabled veterans under 65, the veteran credit of $1,100 is the best option.

### Does the property tax credit apply to second homes or rental properties?

No. The credit applies only to your **primary residence** where you live most of the year.

### What happens if my property tax is less than $1,100?

You receive credit only up to the amount of tax you actually paid. For example, if your property tax is $800, you receive $800 in credit, not $1,100.

### Are military retirement benefits taxed if I move to Missouri from another state?

No. As long as you establish Missouri residency, all military retirement pay is exempt from state income tax regardless of where you served or previously lived.

### Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax credit after I die?

Yes, if your surviving spouse:
- Remains unremarried
- Continues to own and occupy the home as primary residence
- You were 100% disabled or died from service-connected disability

Your spouse should contact the Missouri Department of Revenue for guidance on continuing the benefit.

### What if my county denies my property tax credit claim?

If your credit is denied:
1. Request explanation in writing
2. Verify you submitted all required documentation
3. Contact Missouri Department of Revenue: (573) 751-3505
4. Contact your county veterans service officer for assistance
5. You have the right to appeal the denial

### Do I need to be retired from the military to get these benefits?

- **Property tax credit**: No, only need qualifying VA disability rating
- **Income tax exemption on military retirement**: Yes, must be receiving military retirement pay
- **Free license plates**: No, only need service-connected disability rating
- **Hunting/fishing license**: No, only need 80%+ disability rating

### Does Missouri tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, but at Missouri's modest rates (currently max 5.3%, dropping to 4.5% by 2026). Qualified retirement account withdrawals are treated as regular income. However, military retirees benefit from the military retirement exemption.

### Will moving to Missouri from a high-tax state save me money?

**Likely yes**, especially if you're receiving military retirement income. Compared to states like California (13.3% top rate), New York (10.9%), or Illinois (4.95% flat with high property taxes), Missouri offers significant savings.

**Example**: E-7 retiree with $30,000/year pension
- California state tax: ~$900/year
- Missouri state tax: **$0**
- **Annual savings: $900**
- **20-year savings: $18,000+**

### Can I claim the property tax credit if I don't file a Missouri income tax return?

Yes! Even if your income is low enough that you don't owe Missouri income tax, you can still file Form MO-PTC to claim the property tax credit as a refund.

### What if I own my home jointly with my spouse?

You can still claim the full credit as long as:
- You're a qualifying disabled veteran
- The home is your primary residence
- You paid the property taxes

Joint ownership doesn't reduce the credit amount.

### Does the property tax credit reduce my federal taxes?

Indirectly. If you itemize deductions on your federal return, you can only deduct property taxes actually paid (net of the credit). However, most veterans benefit more from the standard deduction anyway.

## Key Takeaways

Missouri delivers meaningful financial value for veterans:

1. **100% disabled veterans** save $60,000+ over 20 years through combined tax benefits
2. **All military retirees** keep their entire retirement check - no state taxes
3. **Disabled veterans** get free license plates and reduced property taxes
4. **80%+ disabled veterans** receive free lifetime hunting and fishing permits
5. **30%+ disabled veterans** get free state park admission

Combined with Missouri's cost of living (12.6% below national average), these benefits stretch your retirement dollars significantly further.

If you're 100% P&T and haven't claimed the property tax credit yet, file Form MO-PTC with your next Missouri income tax return. You could receive $1,100 back.
