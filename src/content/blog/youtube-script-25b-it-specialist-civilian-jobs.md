[INTRO - 15 seconds]

**Hook (first 3 seconds):**
25B getting out? Here's your roadmap from help desk to six-figure cybersecurity in under 2 years.

**Context (next 12 seconds):**
I'm going to show you the exact career ladder that 25Bs are using to hit $120K salaries, which certifications actually matter and which are a waste of money, and the companies actively recruiting IT vets right now. Plus, how to get $5,000 worth of certs completely free.

[MAIN CONTENT - 7-8 minutes]

**Section 1: Your Market Value Reality (60 seconds)**

Let's start with what you're worth. As a 25B, you're in the best position of almost any MOS for civilian transition.

[Visual suggestion: Salary progression chart]

Average 25B civilian salary: $80,582/year according to 2025 data. But that's just average. Here's the real progression:

- Help Desk Technician (entry): $52,000-$64,000
- Network Administrator (2-3 years): $70,000-$93,000
- Cybersecurity Analyst (3-5 years): $100,000-$130,000
- Senior Security Engineer (5+ years): $140,000-$215,000

The IT field has 514,000 open positions right now. Median cybersecurity salary is $120,000. You're not competing for jobs, companies are competing for you.

**The certification advantage:** With the right certs, you can skip help desk entirely and start at $70K+. I'll show you how.

**Section 2: The Career Ladder Strategy (90 seconds)**

Most 25Bs make one critical mistake: they take the first help desk job offered at $50K and get stuck there. Here's the smarter path.

[Visual suggestion: Career ladder with timelines]

**Option 1: The Fast Track (Recommended)**

Timeline: 6-12 months to $70K+ job

**Step 1 (while still in or within 180 days):**
- Get Security+ through DoD COOL (free)
- Get CCNA through Onward to Opportunity (free)
- Start studying for CISSP

**Step 2 (immediately after separation):**
- Apply directly to network admin or junior security analyst roles
- Target: $70K-$85K starting salary
- Skip help desk entirely

**Companies hiring for these entry roles:**
- Microsoft (MSSA program graduates: 90%+ placement rate)
- Amazon AWS (cloud support roles: $75K-$95K)
- Cisco (networking roles: $70K-$90K)
- Booz Allen Hamilton (cleared IT: $80K-$100K)

**Option 2: The Stable Climb**

Timeline: Start immediately at $52K-$64K, but slower growth

**Start:** Help desk technician
**6-12 months:** Desktop support or junior network tech
**2-3 years:** Network administrator or systems admin
**3-5 years:** Senior positions or cybersecurity

This works if you need income immediately and don't have time for certifications. But you're leaving money on the table.

**Section 3: The Certifications That Actually Matter (90 seconds)**

Not all certs are equal. Here's what employers actually look for, in order of impact:

**Section 6: The Security Clearance Multiplier (60 seconds)**

If you have an active security clearance, this changes everything.

[Visual suggestion: Salary comparison cleared vs non-cleared]

**The numbers:**
- Same job, no clearance: $80K
- Same job with Secret: $95K-$105K
- Same job with TS/SCI: $110K-$130K+

**Maintaining your clearance:**

If you're getting out, find a cleared position within 2 years to keep it active. After 2 years, it becomes inactive and companies have to reinvestigate (expensive for them, limits your options).

**Cleared job boards:**
- ClearanceJobs.com
- ClearedConnections.com
- Indeed.com (filter by security clearance)

**Reality check:** Most major defense contractors only hire cleared IT personnel. Your clearance can be worth $20K-$40K in additional salary.

**Section 7: Your 90-Day Action Plan (90 seconds)**

Here's exactly what to do in your first 90 days after separation:

[Visual suggestion: Timeline checklist]

**Days 1-30:**
- Enroll in VET TEC or MSSA program
- Get Security+ (study 2-4 weeks, take exam)
- Update resume with civilian job titles
- Use Military Skills Translator on LinkedIn

**Days 31-60:**
- Get CCNA or start AWS certification
- Apply to 20+ positions (use indeed, LinkedIn, company sites directly)
- Join veteran IT groups (LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Attend virtual career fairs

**Days 61-90:**
- Interview prep (technical questions for IT)
- Get third certification (CySA+ or cloud cert)
- Follow up on applications
- Negotiate offers (don't take first offer immediately)

**Resume hack:** Don't say "25B Information Technology Specialist." Say:
- "Network Administrator - Managed 500+ endpoints"
- "Systems Administrator - Maintained 99.9% uptime"
- "IT Support Specialist - Resolved 50+ tickets daily"

Translate military jargon into civilian titles they recognize.

**Section 8: Common Mistakes to Avoid (60 seconds)**

**Mistake #1:** Taking the first job offered
- First offer is rarely the best offer
- Apply to 20+ companies, compare offers
- Negotiate (IT employers expect it)

**Mistake #2:** Undervaluing yourself
- Don't apply for $45K help desk if you have Security+ and CCNA
- You're qualified for $70K+ roles immediately

**Mistake #3:** Paying for certifications
- Everything can be free for veterans
- Never pay out of pocket for certs listed above

**Mistake #4:** Ignoring remote work
- Many IT jobs are 100% remote now
- You can live in low cost of living area, earn Silicon Valley salary
- Expands your job options 10x

**Mistake #5:** Not using your clearance
- If you have one, only apply to cleared positions (higher pay)
- If you don't, that's fine, but don't lie about it
