# VA Disability Rating for Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9400** with ratings from **0% to 100%** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. Most veterans with diagnosed anxiety receive **30-50%** depending on severity. GAD can be claimed as direct service connection from military stressors or as **secondary** to chronic pain, PTSD, TBI, or other service-connected conditions. The key to an accurate rating is demonstrating how anxiety affects your **occupational and social functioning**—worry alone isn't enough; you must show functional impairment. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by persistent, excessive worry about multiple aspects of life that is difficult to control. Unlike situational anxiety, GAD involves chronic worry disproportionate to actual circumstances.

**Symptoms of GAD include:**
- Persistent, excessive worry about multiple areas (work, health, family, finances)
- Difficulty controlling worry
- Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
- Being easily fatigued
- Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
- Irritability
- Muscle tension
- Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or restless sleep)
- Physical symptoms: headaches, stomachaches, unexplained pain

**Military connections to anxiety:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Combat exposure and hypervigilance that persists as anxiety
- High-stress operational environments
- Responsibility for others' lives
- Unpredictable and dangerous situations
- Training accidents or witnessing injuries
- Constant readiness requirements
- Sleep deprivation and chronic stress

**Secondary service connection:**
- **Chronic pain conditions**: Living with constant pain causes anxiety
- **PTSD**: Often co-occurs with anxiety disorders
- **TBI**: Brain injury affects anxiety regulation
- **Sleep apnea/disorders**: Poor sleep worsens anxiety
- **Tinnitus**: Constant noise increases stress/anxiety
- **Heart conditions**: Awareness of health issues causes anxiety

## VA Rating Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder

GAD is rated under **38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9400** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mental condition diagnosed, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or require continuous medication |
| **10%** | Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, OR symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **30%** | Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss |
| **50%** | Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty establishing and maintaining effective relationships |
| **70%** | Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, mood), due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; near-continuous panic or depression affecting ability to function independently; impaired impulse control; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name |

### Key Points About GAD Ratings

**The symptoms listed are examples**, not requirements. The VA must evaluate your overall functional impairment.

**Medication use supports at least 10%** if your symptoms are controlled by continuous medication.

**Panic attacks are key markers:** Weekly or less = 30%; More than weekly = 50%

**70% requires "deficiencies in most areas"**—work, family, judgment, thinking, OR mood. Not all, but most.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**For direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing anxiety complaints
- Mental health counseling records
- Documentation of stressful service (combat, high-ops tempo)
- Performance evaluations showing decline
- Buddy statements about behavioral changes

**For secondary service connection:**
- Service-connected primary condition
- Medical nexus connecting anxiety to that condition
- Treatment records showing anxiety symptoms

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **Mental health evaluation** diagnosing GAD
2. **Treatment records** showing:
   - Ongoing therapy
   - Medications prescribed
   - Symptom documentation

### Severity Evidence

**Document functional impairment:**
- Work problems (missed days, conflicts, performance)
- Relationship difficulties
- Social withdrawal
- Sleep issues
- Physical symptoms
- Avoidance behaviors

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The anxiety C&P exam typically lasts 30-60 minutes.

**The examiner will assess:**
1. Onset and history of anxiety
2. Current symptoms and severity
3. Treatment history
4. Occupational impairment
5. Social impairment

**What to tell them:**
- Describe specific worries and how they affect you
- Quantify: "I have panic attacks twice a week"
- Explain functional impact: "I've missed work due to anxiety"
- Don't minimize symptoms

**Common mistakes:**
- Appearing "calm" at exam—describe your typical state
- Not mentioning panic attacks
- Underreporting avoidance behaviors
- Forgetting physical symptoms (muscle tension, headaches)

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With GAD

1. **Major Depressive Disorder** - DC 9434
   - Very commonly co-occurs
   - Usually rated together

2. **Panic Disorder** - DC 9412
   - If panic attacks are prominent

3. **PTSD** - DC 9411
   - Often co-occurs

4. **Migraines** - DC 8100
   - Stress triggers headaches

5. **GERD** - DC 7346
   - Anxiety affects digestive system

6. **IBS** - DC 7319
   - Strong anxiety-gut connection

7. **Hypertension** - DC 7101
   - Chronic stress raises blood pressure

8. **Sleep Disorders** - DC 6847
   - Anxiety disrupts sleep

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied

### 1. "No nexus to service"
**How to avoid:** Document in-service stressors; establish secondary connection

### 2. "Symptoms controlled by medication"
**How to understand:** This is still 10%—not a denial

### 3. "No current diagnosis"
**How to avoid:** Get private diagnosis before filing

### 4. "Symptoms don't meet rating criteria"
**How to avoid:** Be thorough about functional impairment at exam
