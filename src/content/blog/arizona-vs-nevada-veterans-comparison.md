## Final Verdict

### Choose Arizona if:
- You want lowest cost of living (2-3% cheaper)
- You prefer larger veteran community
- You value better VA healthcare access
- You want more diverse job market
- You prefer higher average salaries
- You want secure water supply long-term

### Choose Nevada if:
- You want NO state income tax (even on other income)
- You enjoy entertainment/Las Vegas lifestyle
- You prefer smaller veteran population
- You value gaming/entertainment options
- You want slightly more upscale lifestyle options

**The Numbers:** Arizona offers better overall value for most veterans due to:
- Lower cost of living (2-3%)
- Better job market and salaries
- Superior VA healthcare access
- Larger, more established veteran communities
- Better water security

The tax advantage of Nevada (no tax on other income) amounts to $780-$930 annually for a retiree with modest additional income. However, Arizona's cost of living advantage (2-3%) typically offsets this benefit for the average veteran.

**For most military retirees, Arizona is the superior choice** due to comprehensive advantages in VA healthcare, cost of living, job market, and community infrastructure. Nevada appeals primarily to high-earning retirees seeking maximum tax efficiency and entertainment-focused lifestyles.
