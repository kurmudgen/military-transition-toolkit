## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 11B Infantrymen have **direct pathways to law enforcement earning $50,000-$110,000+ annually with exceptional benefits**. Your small unit leadership, weapons proficiency, tactical operations, decision-making under stress, and teamwork translate directly to patrol officer, detective, federal agent, and tactical team positions. Entry-level police officers start at **$45,000-$65,000**, experienced officers earn **$60,000-$85,000**, detectives/sergeants make **$70,000-$95,000**, and federal agents command **$60,000-$130,000+**. No additional certifications needed pre-hire - police academies are paid training (4-6 months). Veterans receive preference points for federal positions. Law enforcement agencies nationwide actively recruit combat veterans for their discipline, tactical skills, and leadership experience.

## Why 11B Infantrymen Excel in Law Enforcement

Every infantryman researching civilian careers hears: "Law enforcement is different from combat." "You'll overreact." "Military training doesn't translate to community policing."

Here's what law enforcement agencies actually know: **The best officers come from military backgrounds with proven discipline, courage, and decision-making under pressure.**

You didn't just "shoot guns." You:
- Led fire teams and squads under high-stress conditions
- Made split-second decisions affecting lives
- Operated under clear rules of engagement and escalation of force
- Conducted patrols in hostile and permissive environments
- Communicated effectively in crisis situations
- Maintained weapon safety and discipline
- Worked rotating shifts in all conditions
- Gathered and reported intelligence
- Interacted with diverse populations and cultures
- Provided security and protection
- Testified and documented actions accurately
- Performed under physical and mental stress
- Followed chain of command and standard procedures
- Demonstrated integrity and ethical conduct

That's not "just infantry" - that's law enforcement foundation. Police work is patrol, investigation, protection, and de-escalation - skills infantry soldiers develop through training and operational experience.

**Mistake #2:** Poor physical condition. Don't wait until hired to get in shape. Many fail academy PT standards. Start training immediately.

**Mistake #3:** Applying to only one agency. Hiring is competitive and process is long. Apply to many agencies to increase chances and timeline.

**Mistake #4:** Not considering federal agencies if you have degree. Federal agents earn $60K-$130K+ with excellent benefits and veteran preference.

**Mistake #5:** Thinking military mindset won't translate. De-escalation, community interaction, service orientation are taught in academy. Your tactical skills, discipline, integrity are exactly what's needed.
