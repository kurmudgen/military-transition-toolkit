# VA Disability Rating for Knee Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Knee conditions are among the **top 5 most claimed VA disabilities**. The VA rates knees under multiple diagnostic codes, and the key to maximizing your rating is understanding you may qualify for **multiple separate ratings** for the same knee: one for **limitation of flexion** (5260), one for **limitation of extension** (5261), and one for **instability** (5257). Each knee is rated separately, so bilateral knee problems can significantly increase your total rating. Ratings range from **0% to 60%** per condition, per knee. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Knee Conditions and How Does Military Service Cause Them?

Knee conditions include a range of injuries and degenerative changes affecting the joint, ligaments, cartilage, and surrounding structures. The knee is particularly vulnerable to military service-related damage due to the high-impact nature of training and operations.

**Common military causes:**

- **Running and marching**: Thousands of miles in boots, often on hard surfaces
- **Rucking**: Heavy loads (50-100+ lbs) stressing knees
- **Jumping and landing**: Airborne operations, obstacle courses, tactical movements
- **Kneeling**: Extended time on hard surfaces (shooting positions, maintenance)
- **Direct trauma**: Falls, vehicle accidents, combat injuries
- **Sports injuries**: Unit PT, mandatory sports programs
- **Twisting injuries**: Quick direction changes with heavy loads
- **Vehicle operations**: Climbing in/out of vehicles, vibration
- **Repetitive stress**: Squatting, climbing, stair running

**Common diagnoses:**
- Patellofemoral pain syndrome ("runner's knee")
- Meniscus tears
- ACL/PCL/MCL/LCL injuries
- Osteoarthritis
- Chondromalacia patella
- Tendinitis/tendinosis
- Bursitis
- Cartilage damage

## VA Rating Criteria for Knee Conditions

The VA rates knee conditions under several diagnostic codes in **38 CFR § 4.71a**. Understanding these is crucial for maximizing your rating.

### Diagnostic Code 5260 - Limitation of Flexion

Flexion = bending the knee (normal is 0° to 140°)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Flexion limited to 60° |
| **10%** | Flexion limited to 45° |
| **20%** | Flexion limited to 30° |
| **30%** | Flexion limited to 15° |

### Diagnostic Code 5261 - Limitation of Extension

Extension = straightening the knee (normal is 0°, or fully straight)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Extension limited to 5° |
| **10%** | Extension limited to 10° |
| **20%** | Extension limited to 15° |
| **30%** | Extension limited to 20° |
| **40%** | Extension limited to 30° |
| **50%** | Extension limited to 45° |

### Diagnostic Code 5257 - Recurrent Subluxation or Lateral Instability

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Slight instability |
| **20%** | Moderate instability |
| **30%** | Severe instability |

### Diagnostic Code 5258 - Dislocated Semilunar Cartilage (Meniscus)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **20%** | Dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion (swelling) into the joint |

### Diagnostic Code 5259 - Removal of Semilunar Cartilage (Meniscectomy)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage |

### Diagnostic Code 5256 - Ankylosis of the Knee

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **30%** | Favorable angle in full extension, or in slight flexion between 0° and 10° |
| **40%** | In flexion between 10° and 20° |
| **50%** | In flexion between 20° and 45° |
| **60%** | Extremely unfavorable, in flexion at an angle of 45° or more |

### Diagnostic Code 5262 - Impairment of Tibia and Fibula

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Malunion with slight knee or ankle disability |
| **20%** | Malunion with moderate knee or ankle disability |
| **30%** | Malunion with marked knee or ankle disability |
| **40%** | Nonunion with loose motion, requiring brace |

### Key Concept: Multiple Ratings for One Knee

**This is crucial for maximizing your rating:**

The VA recognizes that **limitation of flexion, limitation of extension, and instability** are separate disabilities. You can receive separate ratings for each condition in the same knee under **VAOPGCPREC 23-97** and **VAOPGCPREC 9-98**.

**Example:**
- Right knee limitation of flexion: 10% (DC 5260)
- Right knee limitation of extension: 10% (DC 5261)
- Right knee instability: 10% (DC 5257)

All three ratings are combined, significantly increasing your overall disability percentage.

**Important:** If you have both flexion and extension limitations but neither qualifies for a compensable rating alone, you may still get 10% for painful motion under 38 CFR § 4.59.

### Painful Motion (38 CFR § 4.59)

Even if your range of motion doesn't meet the criteria for 10%, you can receive a minimum 10% rating if you have:
- Painful motion documented by objective evidence
- X-ray evidence of arthritis (for joints affected by arthritis)

This means if you have knee arthritis with pain, you should receive at least 10% even if you have near-normal range of motion.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**In-service documentation:**
- Service treatment records showing knee complaints, injuries, or treatment
- Line of duty determinations
- Physical profiles limiting running/marching/squatting
- Sick call visits for knee pain
- MRI, X-ray, or arthroscopy results from service
- Surgical records (meniscus repair, ACL reconstruction, etc.)

**Circumstantial evidence:**
- MOS requiring high physical demands
- Airborne, ranger, or infantry service
- Deployment records (frequent patrols, dismounted operations)
- Fitness test score declines
- Buddy statements about shared physical demands

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA C&P exam findings**
2. **Private orthopedic evaluation** with nexus statement
3. **Current imaging:**
   - X-ray showing arthritis, bone spurs, joint space narrowing
   - MRI showing meniscus tears, ligament damage, cartilage loss
4. **Physical examination findings:**
   - Range of motion limitations
   - Instability on stress testing
   - Crepitus (grinding)
   - Swelling

### Severity Evidence

1. **Medical records documenting:**
   - Ongoing treatment
   - Medications (NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections)
   - Physical therapy
   - Use of braces or assistive devices
   - Surgical history

2. **Personal statement describing:**
   - Pain levels and frequency
   - Activities limited by knee problems
   - Flare-ups (triggers, duration, additional limitation)
   - Need for braces, cane, or other devices
   - Impact on work and daily activities

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The knee C&P exam directly determines your rating. Here's what happens:

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file and medical records
2. Ask about injury history and current symptoms
3. **Measure range of motion** (critical for rating)
4. Test for **instability** (ligament stress tests)
5. Check for swelling, tenderness, crepitus
6. Assess gait and need for assistive devices
7. Test repetitive motion (3 times) and note any changes

**Range of Motion Testing:**

The examiner measures:
- **Flexion**: How far you can bend your knee (normal 140°)
- **Extension**: How straight your knee gets (normal 0°)

They should measure:
- Active range of motion (you move your leg)
- Passive range of motion (examiner moves your leg)
- After repetitive motion (three times)
- Where pain begins for each movement

**Instability Testing:**

The examiner performs:
- **Anterior drawer test**: Tests ACL
- **Posterior drawer test**: Tests PCL
- **Varus/valgus stress tests**: Tests collateral ligaments
- **Lachman test**: Tests ACL

**What to tell them:**

1. **Report where pain begins**: "I feel pain starting at about 90 degrees of flexion"
2. **Describe instability symptoms**: "My knee gives way when I walk downstairs"
3. **Mention all symptoms**: Pain, swelling, locking, catching, grinding, giving way
4. **Describe functional limitations**: "I can't run, kneel, or squat"
5. **Explain flare-ups**: "After walking a mile, my knee swells and I can barely bend it"
6. **Don't forget to mention brace use**: If you wear a brace, bring it and explain why

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Forcing through pain**: Stop at pain onset—that's your measurement
- **Not mentioning instability**: If your knee ever gives way, say so
- **Forgetting the other knee**: If both hurt, get both examined
- **Being tested after rest**: Your stiff morning knees or post-activity pain is relevant
- **Not describing worst days**: Explain your limitations during flare-ups

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Knee Conditions

Knee problems often cause or worsen other conditions:

1. **Hip Conditions** (DC 5252, 5253)
   - Altered gait stresses hip joints
   - Very common secondary claim
   - Each hip rated separately

2. **Lower Back Strain** (DC 5237)
   - Abnormal gait mechanics affect spine
   - Frequently secondary to knee conditions

3. **Opposite Knee Condition**
   - Favoring one knee overloads the other
   - Claim aggravation of contralateral knee

4. **Ankle Conditions** (DC 5271)
   - Gait changes affect ankle
   - Can be secondary to knee

5. **Obesity (aggravation)**
   - Inability to exercise due to knee pain
   - Can aggravate other conditions

6. **Depression/Anxiety** (DC 9434, 9400)
   - Chronic pain affects mental health
   - Loss of mobility and activities

7. **Scars** (DC 7801-7805)
   - From surgical repairs
   - Rated separately if painful or unstable

8. **Radiculopathy** (DC 8520)
   - If back is secondary and causes nerve issues

9. **Sleep Disturbance**
   - Knee pain disrupting sleep
   - Supports mental health claims

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "No current diagnosis"
**Why it happens:** No documented pathology found
**How to avoid:**
- Get imaging (X-ray, MRI) before filing
- Document specific diagnosis, not just "knee pain"

### 2. "No nexus to service"
**Why it happens:** Examiner attributes to aging or other causes
**How to avoid:**
- Emphasize in-service injuries or demands
- Get buddy statements about physical requirements
- Obtain private nexus opinion

### 3. "Range of motion doesn't meet criteria"
**Why it happens:** Measurements didn't reach compensable levels
**How to avoid:**
- Stop at pain onset, not maximum stretch
- Ensure flare-up impacts are documented
- Request consideration under 38 CFR § 4.59 for painful motion

### 4. "No instability found on exam"
**Why it happens:** Knee was stable during testing
**How to avoid:**
- Describe specific giving way incidents
- Bring documentation of brace prescription
- Get buddy statements about witnessed instability

### 5. "Pre-existing condition"
**Why it happens:** Knee problems documented before service
**How to avoid:**
- Argue aggravation beyond natural progression
- Document worsening during service
- Show increased symptoms or treatment needs

## Buddy Statement Tips for Knee Conditions

**For fellow service members:**
- Describe physically demanding duties you shared
- Note any knee injuries or complaints you witnessed
- Corroborate specific incidents
- Describe activities that stressed knees (rucking, running, jumps)

**For family/spouse:**
- Describe mobility limitations you've observed
- Activities the veteran used to do but can't now
- Instances of knee giving way you've witnessed
- Need for braces or assistive devices
- Impact on daily activities and relationship

**Example:**
"I have witnessed [Veteran's Name] struggle with their knees since returning from service. They can no longer run or play basketball as they did before. I have seen their knee give out while walking down stairs on [approximate number] occasions. They wear a knee brace daily and frequently take pain medication. They have difficulty getting up from chairs and cannot kneel to play with our children. This represents a significant change from their physical capabilities before military service."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** Examiner errors in ROM measurement or ignoring instability
**When to use:** Evidence was present but misinterpreted

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Adding new evidence
**What to submit:**
- New MRI or X-ray
- Private orthopedic evaluation
- Independent Medical Opinion
- Documentation of worsening

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex cases requiring legal interpretation
**When to use:** If claiming multiple ratings for one knee is denied

**Knee-specific appeal tips:**
- If denied instability, get documented brace prescription and buddy statements
- Request examiner specifically test and document instability
- If ROM was nearly compensable, argue painful motion under § 4.59
- Challenge if only one rating given when multiple conditions exist
- Cite VAOPGCPREC 23-97 and 9-98 if separate ratings weren't considered

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get separate ratings for flexion and extension?
Yes. Under VAOPGCPREC 9-98, separate ratings can be assigned for limitation of flexion and limitation of extension of the same knee. This requires both conditions to be compensable (or one to warrant at least 0% with painful motion).

### Can I get separate ratings for instability AND limitation of motion?
Yes. Under VAOPGCPREC 23-97, a knee with both arthritis causing limitation of motion and instability can receive separate ratings for each condition.

### What if I had knee surgery after service?
If your knee condition is service-connected and you later needed surgery, the surgery and any scars are considered part of your service-connected condition. You may be entitled to temporary 100% rating during convalescence.

### Can I claim both knees?
Absolutely. Each knee is rated separately. If both knees are affected by service, claim both.

### What if my knee feels unstable but the examiner says it's stable?
Instability can be intermittent. Describe specific giving-way incidents in your personal statement, get buddy statements about witnessed instability, and bring documentation of any brace prescription.

### Should I claim my knee as "arthritis" or "strain"?
The specific condition matters less than providing proper evidence. The VA will assign the appropriate diagnostic code based on examination findings. However, if you have X-ray evidence of arthritis, mention it—it supports at least 10% for painful motion.

### Does wearing a knee brace help my claim?
Yes. Document why you wear it and bring it to the exam. Brace use supports claims for instability and overall severity.
