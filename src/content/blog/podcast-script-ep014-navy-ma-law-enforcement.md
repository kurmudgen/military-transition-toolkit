**Federal Law Enforcement:** Border Patrol ($52K-$85K), TSA ($40K starting), Federal Protective Service, US Marshals Service, Secret Service. Veteran preference in hiring. Border Patrol hiring heavily, needs under-40 applicants.

**Sheriff/Corrections:** County sheriffs $55K-$75K, corrections officers federal BOP $45K base plus overtime ($60K-$70K total). Stable government employment.

**Federal Investigator:** FBI, DEA, ATF special agents $80K-$130K+. Competitive but MA experience valued. Requires bachelor's degree (use GI Bill).

**Private Security Management:** Corporate security manager $70K-$95K+, director roles $100K-$140K. Your MA leadership experience applies. Less physical demand than patrol.

**Executive Protection:** High-net-worth individuals, corporate executives $71K-$100K+. Training required (ESI, EPI schools $3K-$5K). Former MAs transition well.

**Cybersecurity:** With additional training/certs, information security analyst $85K-$115K. Your security clearance background helps.

**Companies/Agencies Hiring:**
- All major police departments (veteran recruiting programs)
- US Border Patrol (massive hiring)
- Federal agencies (FBI, DEA, ATF, Marshals)
- Private security: Allied Universal, G4S, Securitas
- Corporate: Fortune 500 companies need security directors

**Path Requirements**

**Police:** Pass physical fitness, background check, psychological evaluation, polygraph. Academy training (paid). Start applying 6-12 months before separation.

**Federal:** USAJobs.gov for positions. Veteran preference (5-10 points). Background investigation extensive. Age limits apply (Border Patrol under 40).

**Private Security:** Less stringent but still background checks. Management roles want experience or degree. Your MA supervisory experience counts.

**Certifications:** Security+ useful for cyber roles. State-specific licensing for private security (armed guard licenses). Executive protection schools offer specialized training.

**Use Your Clearance:** Active Secret/TS clearance valuable for federal contract security positions. Worth $10K-$20K additional salary.

**Timeline**

12 months out: Research departments/agencies in target location. Understand requirements. Start physical training if needed (police fitness standards).

6-9 months out: Apply to police academies or federal positions. Begin background check process (takes 3-6 months). SkillBridge with some law enforcement agencies exists.

3-6 months out: Interview with agencies. Complete psychological evaluations. Receive conditional offers pending final background checks.

1-2 months out: Finalize offers, plan academy start dates around separation/terminal leave.

**Key Differences:** Civilian law enforcement has more accountability/scrutiny than military. Body cameras, civilian oversight, media attention. Politics impacts policing. Shift work standard. But stable careers, good benefits, strong pensions (20-25 years to full retirement).
