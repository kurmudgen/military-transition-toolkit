# Military Spouse to Virtual Assistant: Complete Business Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Virtual assistance is one of the **fastest paths to income** for military spouses—you can be earning within 2-4 weeks. Starting rates range from **$20-35/hour** for general VA work, scaling to **$50-100+/hour** for specialized services. Startup costs are under $500, no certifications are required, and the work is 100% remote. You control your schedule, choose your clients, and take your business with you to every duty station—CONUS or OCONUS.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Here's why virtual assistance is uniquely suited to military life:

**Traditional Employment Problems:**
- Gaps in resume explained at every interview
- Starting over at entry-level each PCS
- No seniority, no advancement
- Childcare costs eating the paycheck
- Can't work during deployments without family support

**Virtual Assistant Solutions:**
- You're the boss—no one asks about gaps
- Clients don't know or care where you live
- Income grows with reputation, not tenure
- Work when kids sleep, during school, around deployments
- Same clients, same income, every duty station

The catch? You're running a business, not filling a job application. That requires more initiative—but offers far more freedom.

- Decide: General VA or specialized niche?
- Niche recommendation for beginners: General admin + one specialty

**Day 3-4: Set Up Business Basics**
- Choose business name (can be your name)
- Set up dedicated business email (Google Workspace: $6/month)
- Create business bank account (separates personal/business)

**Day 5-7: Create Online Presence**

### Week 2: Pricing and Packages

**Setting Your Rates:**

- Starting point for specialized VA: $40-50/hour

**Package Options:**
- **Hourly:** Best for unpredictable tasks ($X/hour)
- **Retainer:** Monthly fee for set hours ($800 for 25 hours/month)

- Post on personal social media
- Ask for referrals and introductions

**Cold Outreach:**

- **Belay:** VA agency, sets you up with clients (you're employed)

## PCS-Proofing Your VA Business

### Before PCS:
1. **Notify clients 30+ days in advance** that you'll have limited availability
2. **Complete major projects** before move date
3. **Set up new internet service** at destination immediately
4. **Have backup plan** (mobile hotspot, library, coffee shop)

### During PCS:
1. **Reduce capacity** but don't disappear
2. **Check email daily** even during chaos (30 minutes minimum)
3. **Use auto-responders** for anything not urgent
4. **Communicate proactively** with clients

### After PCS:
1. **Resume full capacity** within 1-2 weeks
2. **Update address** for business registration (if needed)
3. **Check state business requirements** (most sole proprietors don't need to re-register)
4. **Use PCS as opportunity** to raise rates or change services

### OCONUS Considerations:
- **Time zones:** Some clients love that you can work while they sleep
- **Internet reliability:** Research before you go; Starlink works most places
- **Banking:** Ensure your bank works internationally (USAA, Navy Federal are military-friendly)
- **Taxes:** You may owe taxes in both US and host country—consult accountant

## Success Stories

**Michelle, Army Spouse - General VA → Agency Owner**
"I started as a virtual assistant making $20/hour after our second PCS. I was desperate for something that didn't restart every move. Within a year, I had consistent clients and was making $4K/month part-time. After three years, I now run a VA agency with five contractors and gross $15K/month. When we PCS'd to Germany, my clients had no idea—I just adjusted my working hours."

**Priya, Coast Guard Spouse - Bookkeeping VA**
"I got my QuickBooks certification during a deployment and started offering bookkeeping services. It took three months to get my first client, but she referred me to her business owner friends. Now I have twelve monthly clients and make $6,500/month working about 25 hours a week. The best part? During my husband's next deployment, my income actually increased because I had more time to take on clients."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "I don't have any skills to offer"
**Reality Check:** If you've managed a household, coordinated a PCS, volunteered for FRG/OSC, or held any job ever, you have skills. Email management, scheduling, research, customer service, event planning, social media—these are all VA services.

### "I'm not tech-savvy"
**Solution:** Most VA tools are designed for non-technical people. Google Workspace, Canva, Asana, and Slack can all be learned in a weekend. YouTube tutorials exist for everything. Start with what you know and learn as you go.

### "No one will hire me without experience"
**Solution:** Offer free work to 1-2 clients to build testimonials and portfolio. Join Upwork and take lower-paying jobs to build reviews. Create case studies from volunteer work or FRG experience.

### "I have young children and can't work consistent hours"
**Solution:** This is the beauty of VA work—you set your hours. Work during naps, after bedtime, during school hours. Be upfront with clients about your availability. Many clients don't care when you work, just that the work gets done.

### "What if I can't find clients?"
**Solution:** Client acquisition is the hard part—expect it to take 4-8 weeks. In the meantime: tell everyone you know, send 10 cold emails per day, apply to 5 freelance platform jobs per week. Consistency beats talent.

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Foundation
- **Week 1:** Define services, set up business email and bank account, create basic website
- **Week 2:** Set pricing, create service packages, optimize LinkedIn profile
- **Week 3:** Tell warm network, start cold outreach, apply to freelance platforms
- **Week 4:** Follow up on all leads, adjust strategy based on feedback, land first client

### Days 31-60: First Clients
- **Week 5-6:** Deliver excellent work to first client(s), ask for testimonial after 30 days
- **Week 7-8:** Continue outreach, raise rates for new inquiries, ask for referrals

### Days 61-90: Growth
- **Week 9-10:** Systematize repeated tasks, create standard processes, onboard additional clients
- **Week 11-12:** Evaluate what's working, double down on best client sources, consider niche specialization

**Realistic Targets:**
- End of Month 1: 1-2 clients, $500-$1,500 income
- End of Month 2: 2-4 clients, $1,500-$3,000 income
- End of Month 3: 3-5 clients, $2,500-$4,500 income
