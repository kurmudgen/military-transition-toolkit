## FAQ

**Q: Can I get my first federal contractor job without certifications?**
A: Yes, absolutely. Your security clearance and 35F experience are valuable. However, certifications will accelerate advancement and salary increases. Most contractors hire for entry roles without advanced certifications.

**Q: Which certification should I pursue first?**
A: AWS Security Specialty (fastest ROI, 2-3 months) or CompTIA Security+ (if CISSP pathway is goal). Both establish you as security-focused and are in high contractor demand.

**Q: Will my employer pay for certifications?**
A: Most major federal contractors do. Typically $2,000-$5,000 annually for employee development. Many also offer study time during work hours.

**Q: How much more will I earn with CISSP vs. without?**
A: CISSP-certified professionals earn $35,000-$50,000 more annually in federal contracting than non-certified peers at equivalent experience levels.

**Q: How long does the CISSP certification remain valid?**
A: CISSP certifications are valid for 3 years, then require 120 continuing education credits and a $450 renewal fee. Most professionals renew by passing the exam again or maintaining credits annually.

**Q: Can military intelligence experience count toward CISSP work requirement?**
A: Yes, your 35F experience directly counts toward the 5-year cybersecurity work requirement. ISC² recognizes military intelligence operations as qualifying experience.

**Q: What's the average salary increase from PMP certification?**
A: Federal contractor technical program managers with PMP earn $35,000-$65,000 more annually than analysts without PM experience or certifications, particularly after 2+ years in PM roles.

A: Avoid certifications with low contractor demand (A+, Network+) unless building foundational knowledge. Focus on advanced certifications (CISSP, CCSP, PMP, advanced AWS certifications).

**Q: How do I verify certification ROI for my specific situation?**
A: Check Glassdoor salary data for your target company + certification combination. Most contractors publish salary ranges; federal job postings often show GS-level requirements that correlate to certifications.

**Q: Will getting certified guarantee a salary increase?**
A: New certifications typically result in salary increases or advancement opportunities within 6-12 months of obtaining the credential. Contractors actively seek certified professionals and promote them accordingly.
