# Skin Conditions Secondary to Medications: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Medications commonly cause skin conditions
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-30%
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected condition, medication history, dermatology diagnosis, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate to High (60-75%) with documented skin condition

Many medications prescribed for service-connected conditions cause skin problems as side effects. If you've developed a skin condition from medications treating your service-connected disability, you have grounds for a secondary claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition can result from treatment for a service-connected condition, including medication side effects.

For skin conditions secondary to medications:
- You must have a service-connected condition
- Medications for that condition cause skin problems
- Medical evidence establishes the medication connection

## Medications That Cause Skin Conditions

**Antipsychotics:**
- Lithium → Psoriasis, acne
- Quetiapine → Rashes
- Risperidone → Photosensitivity

## VA Rating Criteria for Skin Conditions

Skin conditions are rated under 38 CFR § 4.118, DC 7800-7833.

### Common Skin Ratings

**DC 7806 - Dermatitis/Eczema:**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 0% | Less than 5% of body or no more than topical therapy |
| 10% | 5-20% of body, OR intermittent systemic therapy <6 weeks/year |
| 30% | 20-40% of body, OR systemic therapy 6+ weeks/year |
| 60% | >40% of body, OR constant systemic therapy |

**DC 7816 - Psoriasis:**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 0% | Less than 5% of body or no more than topical therapy |
| 10% | 5-20% of body, OR intermittent systemic therapy <6 weeks/year |
| 30% | 20-40% of body, OR systemic therapy 6+ weeks/year |
| 60% | >40% of body, OR constant systemic therapy |

**DC 7825 - Urticaria:**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Recurrent episodes <4x/year, antihistamine or symptomatic treatment |
| 30% | Recurrent debilitating episodes 4x/year, requiring intermittent systemic immunosuppressive therapy |
| 60% | Recurrent debilitating episodes ≥4x/year requiring near-constant systemic immunosuppressive therapy |

### Key Rating Factors

**Body Surface Area:**
- Percentage of body affected
- Higher percentage = higher rating

**Treatment Required:**
- Topical only = lower rating
- Systemic therapy = higher rating
- "Systemic" includes oral medications, injections

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Primary Condition:**
- Service connection documentation
- Medication history with dates
- Complete pharmacy records

**For Skin Condition:**
- Dermatology diagnosis
- Description of affected areas
- Body surface area percentage
- Treatment records
- Photos if available

### Medication Timeline

**Document:**
- When each medication started
- When skin symptoms began
- Correlation between the two
- FDA warnings for medication

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Dermatologist or physician
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Skin condition diagnosis**
4. **Medication review** with side effect profiles
5. **Causal statement**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including medication history and dermatological evaluations. [Veteran] is service-connected for PTSD at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Drug-induced psoriasis*

*[Veteran] has been on lithium carbonate for bipolar symptoms associated with PTSD since [date]. Dermatological examination reveals psoriatic plaques affecting approximately 15% body surface area.*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] psoriasis is at least as likely as not caused by lithium therapy for the service-connected psychiatric condition.*

*Medical Rationale: Lithium is well-documented to cause psoriasis and exacerbate existing psoriasis. The mechanism involves lithium's effects on inositol metabolism and keratinocyte proliferation. [Veteran's] psoriasis developed [X] months after initiating lithium therapy, with no prior history of psoriasis. This temporal relationship and known causal mechanism support drug-induced psoriasis from service-connected medication."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Causative Medication

Review all medications for service-connected conditions:
- Check FDA labeling for skin side effects
- Note timing of skin symptoms relative to medication start

### Step 2: Get Dermatology Evaluation

See dermatologist:
- Formal diagnosis
- Body surface area assessment
- Photo documentation
- Treatment recommendations

### Step 3: Create Medication Timeline

Document:
- Medication name and dose
- Start date
- When skin symptoms began
- Known dermatological side effects

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get dermatologist opinion:
- Must cite specific medication and mechanism
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Include photos if available
- Upload all evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Dermatological examination
- Body surface area measurement
- Photos may be taken
- Document current treatment

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No medication timeline** - Must show temporal relationship

2. **Missing dermatology evaluation** - Need formal diagnosis

3. **Not documenting body surface area** - Critical for rating

4. **Forgetting FDA warnings** - Package insert supports causation

5. **No photos** - Visual evidence helpful

6. **Not specifying treatment** - Systemic vs. topical matters for rating

7. **Missing flare documentation** - Skin conditions fluctuate; document worst times

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Lithium-Induced Psoriasis

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, 70% PTSD/bipolar
- On lithium for 10 years
- Developed psoriasis 2 years after starting
- Affects 25% body surface

**Evidence:**
- Dermatology records
- Medication timeline
- Photos showing extent
- Nexus from dermatologist

**Outcome:** 30% for psoriasis (20-40% BSA)
**Combined Rating:** 70% → 79% (rounds to 80%)

### Case Study 2: NSAID-Related Chronic Urticaria

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, 40% back condition
- On chronic NSAIDs
- Developed recurrent hives
- Multiple episodes yearly

**Evidence:**
- Allergy testing
- Urticaria diagnosis
- Medication correlation
- Treatment records

**Outcome:** 10% for urticaria
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 46% (rounds to 50%)

### Case Study 3: Photosensitivity from Antibiotics

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, various service-connected infections
- Chronic antibiotics
- Severe sun reactions
- Had to avoid outdoor work

**Evidence:**
- Documented photosensitive reactions
- Medication review
- Functional impact documentation

**Outcome:** 10% for photosensitivity dermatitis
**Combined Rating:** Increased modestly

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Skin at 10%:**
- Before: 50% = $1,041.82
- Add 10% skin = 55% → rounds to 60%
- After: $1,214.03
- Increase: $172.21/month

**Skin at 30%:**
- Before: 50%
- Add 30% skin = 65% → rounds to 70%
- After: $1,716.28
- Increase: $674.46/month

## Documenting Body Surface Area

### How BSA Is Measured

**Rule of 9s:**
- Head/neck: 9%
- Each arm: 9%
- Each leg: 18%
- Front trunk: 18%
- Back trunk: 18%
- Groin: 1%

### Tips for C&P Exam

- Schedule when condition is active (not during remission)
- Don't apply creams/medications before exam
- Point out all affected areas
- Request photos in medical record

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No nexus to medication"** - Need dermatologist opinion
2. **"Skin condition common"** - Need individualized causation
3. **"Insufficient severity"** - Document BSA and treatment

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Dermatologist nexus
- FDA package insert information
- More detailed medication timeline
- Photos during flares

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which medications most commonly cause skin problems?**
A: Lithium, NSAIDs, antibiotics, and some psychiatric medications have highest rates.

**Q: Do I need a dermatologist?**
A: Not required but strongly recommended for diagnosis and nexus.

**Q: What if my skin improves when I stop the medication?**
A: This actually supports causation. Document the correlation.

**Q: Can I continue the medication and still claim?**
A: Yes. You may need the medication; the side effect is still claimable.

**Q: What's "systemic therapy"?**
A: Pills, injections, or any medication that works throughout the body (not just topical creams).
