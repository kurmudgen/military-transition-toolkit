# VA Disability Rating for Gout: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Gout is rated under **Diagnostic Code 5017** (gout) and rated as **rheumatoid arthritis** under **DC 5002** with ratings from **20% to 100%**. Alternatively, chronic gout can be rated based on **limitation of motion** of affected joints. Most veterans receive **20-40%** depending on frequency of attacks and joint damage. The key is documenting **attack frequency**, **blood uric acid levels**, and **joint involvement**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Gout?

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by excess uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia), which forms crystals in joints.

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden, severe joint pain (often at night)
- Swelling, redness, and warmth in affected joint
- Most commonly affects big toe (podagra)
- Can affect ankles, knees, wrists, fingers, elbows
- Tophi (uric acid deposits) in chronic cases

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- First gout attack during service
- Dietary factors during deployment
- Dehydration contributing to high uric acid
- Service-related injury to joint where gout developed

**Secondary service connection:**
- Kidney disease (affects uric acid processing)
- Hypertension medications (diuretics)
- Obesity from service-connected conditions
- Diabetes

## VA Rating Criteria

Gout is rated under **38 CFR § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5017**, which directs rating as rheumatoid arthritis under **DC 5002**:

### Active Process Ratings

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **20%** | One or two exacerbations a year in a well-established diagnosis |
| **40%** | Symptom combinations productive of definite impairment of health objectively supported by examination findings or incapacitating exacerbations occurring 3 or more times a year |
| **60%** | Weight loss and anemia productive of severe impairment of health, or severely incapacitating exacerbations occurring 4 or more times a year, or a lesser number over prolonged periods |
| **100%** | Constitutional manifestations associated with active joint involvement, totally incapacitating |

### Chronic Residuals Rating

Alternatively, chronic gout may be rated based on **limitation of motion** of affected joints under the appropriate diagnostic codes for each joint.

The VA should rate based on whichever method (active process OR chronic residuals) results in a higher rating.

### Key Rating Factors

- **Attack frequency**: Number of exacerbations per year
- **Joint involvement**: Which and how many joints affected
- **Laboratory findings**: Uric acid levels
- **Joint damage**: Chronic changes visible on X-ray
- **Response to treatment**: Well-controlled vs. refractory

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing gout diagnosis or attacks
- Medical records showing high uric acid
- Documentation of first attack
- Nexus to service or service-connected condition

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Rheumatology or primary care diagnosis
- Lab results showing elevated uric acid
- X-rays showing joint changes
- Joint aspiration showing urate crystals (gold standard)

### Severity Evidence
- **Attack log**: Document each gout attack
- Lab history showing uric acid levels
- Treatment records
- X-rays showing joint damage
- Documentation of joint limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical records and labs
2. Examine affected joints
3. Assess frequency of attacks
4. Review medications
5. Order or review X-rays
6. Measure range of motion if joint damage

**What to tell them:**
- How many attacks per year
- Which joints are affected
- How long attacks last
- What triggers attacks
- Medications and their effectiveness
- Any permanent joint damage

**Keep a gout diary:** Track every attack with dates, duration, joints affected, and treatment.

## Secondary Conditions

**Gout can be secondary to:**
- Kidney disease
- Hypertension (and diuretic medications)
- Diabetes
- Obesity from service-connected conditions

**Gout can cause:**
- Kidney stones (uric acid stones)
- Chronic kidney disease
- Joint damage requiring rating by limitation of motion
- Depression (chronic pain)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I prove my gout is service-connected?
Document first attack during service, show high uric acid levels during service, or establish secondary connection to service-connected kidney disease, hypertension treatment, diabetes, or obesity.

### What if my gout is well-controlled on medication?
You can still receive a rating based on attack frequency. If you have 1-2 attacks per year despite treatment, that supports 20%. More frequent attacks or attacks despite treatment support higher ratings.

### Can I claim joints damaged by gout?
Yes. If gout has caused chronic joint damage with limited motion, those joints can be rated under their respective limitation of motion codes, potentially resulting in a higher overall rating.

### What's the difference between active process and chronic residuals ratings?
Active process rating is based on attack frequency and constitutional symptoms. Chronic residuals rating is based on permanent joint damage and limitation of motion. The VA should use whichever is higher.
