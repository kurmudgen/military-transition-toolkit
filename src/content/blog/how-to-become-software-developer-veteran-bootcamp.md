# How to Become a Software Developer: Complete Veteran Bootcamp Guide (2025)

## Bottom Line Up Front

You can become a software developer in 12-16 weeks via bootcamp, or 6-12 months self-taught, with zero prior experience. **Bootcamp is faster and higher success rate. Self-taught is cheaper but requires extreme discipline.** Bootcamp cost: $9K-$20K (covered by GI Bill for many). Timeline to first job: 3-6 months after bootcamp. Salary: $70K-$90K starting, **$150K+ within 5 years** if you're a strong performer.

The hard truth: Bootcamp is hard. You'll work 60-70 hours per week for 16 weeks. You'll have moments where you want to quit. **The people who make it are the ones who commit to finishing regardless.** That's literally the entire filter. Not talent. Not prior experience. Commitment.

## Why Now Is the Best Time for Veterans to Learn Code

The job market for junior developers is strong right now (2025). Companies are hiring. Bootcamp outcomes are better than ever. And veteran hiring programs in tech are actually real, not just lip service.

**Specific advantages for veterans:**
- **Security clearance:** If you have one, +$15-25K bonus to salary immediately
- **Discipline:** You'll finish bootcamp when others quit
- **Accountability:** You take ownership of code quality
- **Leadership ready:** Companies love hiring veterans for senior roles
- **Focus:** You know what you want (unlike 22-year-olds figuring out life)

## Bootcamp vs. Self-Taught vs. Degree: Choose Your Path

### Path 1: Bootcamp (Recommended for Most)

**Why choose bootcamp:**
- Structured curriculum (no "what should I learn?" paralysis)
- Peer support (cohort of 20-30 people learning together)
- Job search support (resume, interview prep, connections)
- Speed (16 weeks vs. 12 months self-taught)
- Higher success rate (60-70% get jobs within 6 months vs. 30-40% self-taught)

**Why veterans thrive:** You're used to structure. You finish what you start.

**Timeline:** 16 weeks (intensive) + 3-6 months job search = 6-9 months total

**Cost:** $9K-$20K
- Some GI Bill coverage
- Some have payment plans ($500/month)
- Some have income-share agreements (pay % of salary if you get hired)

**Best bootcamps for veterans:**
1. **Hack Reactor** ($17K)
   - **Why:** Excellent curriculum, strong job outcomes (78% hired within 6 months)
   - **Format:** 12 weeks full-time or 24 weeks part-time
   - **Job guarantee:** Not formal, but track record is strong
   - **Veteran focus:** Veteran recruiting partnerships
   - **Locations:** SF, Austin, Los Angeles, New York, Houston + online

2. **Springboard** ($9,900)
   - **Why:** Cheapest quality option, self-paced, flexible
   - **Format:** 6-9 months flexible (you control pace)
   - **Job guarantee:** $4K back if you don't get hired within 6 months
   - **Veteran focus:** Veteran scholarships available
   - **Locations:** Online only

3. **General Assembly** ($15K-$16K)
   - **Why:** Full-time, excellent job outcomes, strong network
   - **Format:** 12 weeks full-time or 24 weeks part-time
   - **Job guarantee:** Career outcomes tracked (high placement rate)
   - **Veteran focus:** GI Bill partnership
   - **Locations:** Multiple campuses + online

4. **Flatiron School** ($12K-$16K)
   - **Why:** Strong community, good job outcomes
   - **Format:** 15 weeks full-time or 40 weeks part-time
   - **Job guarantee:** Job search support (not formal guarantee)
   - **Locations:** Multiple + online

5. **App Academy** (Free or $5K)
   - **Why:** Cheapest, strong reputation, outcomes as good as paid bootcamps
   - **Format:** Free (limited spots, extremely competitive) or $5K self-paced
   - **Job guarantee:** Not formal, but outcomes are strong
   - **Reality check:** Free version is HARD. You're competing with everyone. Self-paced is designed for self-motivators. As a veteran, if you can handle discipline, this is the best deal.

**Bootcamp comparison table:**

| Bootcamp | Cost | Length | Format | Job Guarantee | Best For |
|----------|------|--------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Hack Reactor | $17K | 12 weeks | Full-time | High success | Committed learners, can go full-time |
| Springboard | $9.9K | 24 weeks | Self-paced | $4K refund | Flexible schedule, tight budget |
| General Assembly | $15K | 12 weeks | Full-time | Good outcomes | Network, full-time available |
| Flatiron | $12K | 15 weeks | Full-time | Good outcomes | Strong community |
| App Academy | Free-$5K | 16 weeks | Intensive | Strong outcomes | Extreme commitment, tight budget |

### Path 2: Self-Taught (Hardest, Cheapest)

**Why choose self-taught:**
- Cheapest ($100-500 total)
- Flexible schedule (do it around work/life)
- Learn what interests you (not forced curriculum)

**Why it's hard for most people:**
- No structure = easy to procrastinate
- No peer pressure = easy to quit
- No job search support = you figure out recruiting alone
- Takes longer (12-18 months typical)
- Lower success rate (fewer people finish, fewer get hired)

**Timeline:** 6-12 months learning + 3-6 months job search = 9-18 months total

**Cost:** $100-500
- freeCodeCamp (free)
- Codecademy ($30/month, can do in 3-4 months)
- Books ($30-50 each, maybe 2-3)
- Practice sites: LeetCode ($60/month)
- Certification exam ($100-200)

**Real truth:** Self-taught works IF and ONLY IF you have extreme discipline. You will feel like no one cares if you stop. Because no one will. You have to care for yourself.

**Self-taught success factors:**
- Join a community (Discord servers, Reddit r/learnprogramming)
- Find an accountability partner (another person learning)
- Set a public goal (Twitter, blog, tell friends)
- Build in public (GitHub, blog posts about learning)
- Have a strict schedule (same time every day)

**Self-taught veteran success story:** SFC Robert Gonzales (Army) learned Python on weekends while still active duty. Took 10 months. Built a portfolio of 4 projects. Got hired at startup ($68K). Now 4 years later, staff engineer at $180K. He's the exception because he treated it like a second job—scheduled time, showed up, did the work.

### Path 3: Degree Program (Slowest, Most Expensive)

**Why choose degree:**
- Credential recognized everywhere
- 4 years of deep learning
- Campus experience / networking
- Some employers require it (older companies, government)
- Can often use GI Bill (100% paid for many schools)

**Why it's slow:** You're spending 2-4 years for a credential when bootcamp gets you a job in 6 months.

**Timeline:** 2-4 years

**Cost:** $50K-$100K (can be covered by GI Bill)

**Real talk:** Most tech jobs don't require a degree. Period. If you're just trying to get hired and make money, bootcamp is smarter. If you want the credential for other reasons (personal satisfaction, plan to leave tech, security clearance requirements), do the degree.

**Blended option:** Many people do bootcamp + online degree part-time (takes 4-5 years for degree, but you're working the whole time).

## What Programming Language to Learn First

**Recommendation: JavaScript or Python**

Both are equally valid. The difference:

### JavaScript
**Best if:** You want to build web applications (websites, web apps)

**Why veterans often choose it:** Visual feedback (you see what you build immediately), lots of jobs, web development is everywhere

**What you build:**
- Websites (React, Vue, Angular)
- Web applications (full-stack: Node.js backend + React frontend)
- Mobile apps (React Native)

**Job market:** Strong. Web developers are in demand everywhere.

**Salary:** $70K-$90K starting, $150K+ senior

**Learn via:** Bootcamps, freeCodeCamp, Codecademy

### Python
**Best if:** You want flexibility (data science, machine learning, backend, automation)

**Why veterans often choose it:** Cleaner syntax (easier to read), great for learning fundamentals, versatile

**What you build:**
- Web applications (Django, Flask backends)
- Data science / machine learning
- Automation scripts
- AI applications

**Job market:** Strong, especially for data science and backend development

**Salary:** $75K-$95K starting (data science commands premium), $150K+ senior

**Learn via:** freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Datacamp

**My honest take:** Pick JavaScript if you want to build web applications. Pick Python if you're unsure or want more options. Both are 100% fine. The language matters way less than learning to think like a programmer.

**Timeline is the same:** 12-16 weeks bootcamp or 6-12 months self-taught, regardless of language.

## Step-by-Step Plan to Become a Software Developer

### Phase 1: Decide and Prepare (Weeks 1-4)

**Week 1: Reality Check**
- [ ] Can you commit 60+ hours per week for 16 weeks? (If not, bootcamp won't work)
- [ ] Do you have a support system? (Family, friends, stable housing?)
- [ ] Can you afford $10-20K, or do you need GI Bill / income-share agreement?
- [ ] Do you have 6+ months of runway before you need to earn money?

**Week 2: Explore Programming (Do This)**
- [ ] Spend 10 hours on freeCodeCamp or Codecademy (free trial)
- [ ] Build a simple "hello world" program
- [ ] Build a simple calculator
- [ ] If you hate it after 10 hours, maybe programming isn't for you
- [ ] If you like it, keep going

**Week 3: Research Bootcamps**
- [ ] List 5-10 bootcamps you might attend
- [ ] Read reviews (Course Report, Switchup)
- [ ] Check job placement rates (talk to graduates)
- [ ] Calculate cost after GI Bill / scholarships
- [ ] Compare: bootcamp vs. self-taught timeline + cost for YOUR situation

**Week 4: Make Decision**
- [ ] Decide: bootcamp or self-taught
- [ ] If bootcamp: apply to 2-3 bootcamps (many have rolling admissions)
- [ ] If self-taught: pick learning platform (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, etc.)
- [ ] Set start date (within 4 weeks)
- [ ] Tell people your goal (accountability)

### Phase 2: Bootcamp / Learning (Weeks 5-20 for bootcamp, Weeks 5-52 for self-taught)

**IF BOOTCAMP:**

**Pre-bootcamp (Week 5, before bootcamp starts):**
- [ ] Do bootcamp's pre-work (usually 20-40 hours)
- [ ] Get a good laptop (MacBook or Windows with 16GB RAM, $700-1200)
- [ ] Set up development environment (code editor, terminal, git)
- [ ] Join bootcamp's Discord/Slack community early
- [ ] Plan your life for 16 weeks (no side projects, minimize distractions)

**Bootcamp Weeks 1-4: Fundamentals**
- Learn syntax of your language (JavaScript or Python)
- Learn how computers actually work (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
- Do small coding challenges
- First group project due end of week 4
- **Expect:** 60+ hours work/week, frustration, people dropping out

**Bootcamp Weeks 5-8: Building Real Apps**

- Build projects with real features
- Second group project
- Start thinking about portfolio

**Bootcamp Weeks 9-12: Capstone Project**
- Build your "magnum opus"—a real product you're proud of
- This project will be your main portfolio piece
- 2-4 person team
- Takes the whole 4 weeks

**Bootcamp Weeks 13-16: Job Search Prep**
- Resume building
- Interview prep
- Start applying to jobs

**IF SELF-TAUGHT:**

**Months 1-2: Fundamentals**
- Learn syntax, data types, functions, loops, conditionals
- Aim for 20-30 hours/week
- Build 3-5 small projects
- Timeline: end of month 2, you should be comfortable with basics

**Months 3-4: Intermediate Projects**
- Build 2-3 medium-complexity projects
- Each project should take 1-2 weeks
- Examples: todo app, weather app, notes app
- Learn libraries / frameworks (React for JavaScript, Flask for Python)
- 25-30 hours/week

**Months 5-6: Build Your Portfolio**
- Build 2 impressive portfolio projects
- Each should be 3-4 weeks of work
- Deploy them (Heroku, Vercel, etc.)
- Make GitHub public and professional
- 30-35 hours/week

**Months 7-8: Interview Prep**
- Start coding interview prep (LeetCode, HackerRank)
- Do 100+ practice problems
- Study algorithms and data structures
- Do mock interviews
- 20-25 hours/week (less time on new skills, more on interview skills)

### Phase 3: Portfolio and Interview Prep (Weeks 21-36 for bootcamp, Weeks 53-104 for self-taught)

**Portfolio Requirements:**
- 3-4 projects on GitHub
- Each has README explaining what it is
- Deployed and working (not just local)
- Shows different skills (frontend, backend, databases, etc.)
- Used by real people (or could be)

**Example portfolio projects:**

1. **Todo App** (Learn the basics)
   - What: Web app where you can add/delete/check off todos
   - Skills: Frontend, state management, basic storage
   - Time: 1 week
   - Deploy: Vercel or Netlify

2. **Weather App** (Learn APIs and real-world data)
   - What: App that shows weather in your city
   - Skills: API integration, async/await, frontend polish
   - Time: 1-2 weeks
   - Deploy: Vercel or Netlify

3. **Budget Tracker / Expense Splitter** (Learn backend)
   - What: App where people log expenses and split bills
   - Skills: Backend API, database, authentication, frontend
   - Time: 3-4 weeks
   - Deploy: Heroku + React frontend

4. **Capstone: Real Problem You Want to Solve**
   - What: Something you actually want to exist
   - Skills: Everything you've learned, complexity
   - Time: 4-6 weeks
   - Deploy: Everything fully deployed

**Interview Prep:**

**LeetCode grind:**
- Month 1: 200 easy problems (30 min/day, 5 days/week)
- Month 2: 100 medium problems (45 min/day, 5 days/week)
- Don't memorize solutions. Learn the patterns.

**System design (if targeting mid-level+ roles):**
- Study how to design large systems (databases, caches, APIs)
- Practice explaining design decisions
- Books: "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu

**Behavioral interview prep:**
- Practice STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Be ready to talk about failures and what you learned
- Prepare 5-10 good stories from projects

**Mock interviews:**
- Use Pramp.com (free peer-to-peer mock interviews)
- Do 5-10 mock interviews before real interviews
- Record yourself and watch it back (painful but effective)

### Phase 4: Job Search (Weeks 37-52 for bootcamp, Weeks 105-208 for self-taught, overlap with phase 3)

**Timeline:** Start applying at week 20 for bootcamp, week 40 for self-taught

**Preparation (Before Applying):**
- [ ] Finish bootcamp or have 3+ portfolio projects
- [ ] Update resume (1-page, action verbs, quantified impact)
- [ ] Create LinkedIn profile (professional photo, detailed experience, portfolio link)
- [ ] Set up GitHub (profile picture, bio, pinned best projects)
- [ ] Create personal portfolio website (GitHub Pages free, or Netlify)

**Resume tips:**
- Don't say "bootcamp graduate"—say "Full-stack web developer"
- Don't say "built todo app"—say "Built full-stack todo application with React frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB database, deployed to Heroku, used by 100+ users"
- Use numbers (not "improved performance"—"reduced page load time from 3.2s to 1.1s")
- Use action verbs: Built, Designed, Engineered, Deployed, Optimized

**Job search strategy:**

**Month 1: Quality over Quantity**
- Target 20-30 companies you actually want to work for
- Customize resume and cover letter for each
- Research the company, mention specific things you admire
- Apply to 5-10 per week (quality applications)
- Send personal message to hiring managers on LinkedIn if possible

**Where to find jobs:**
- LinkedIn (easy filter by company, veteran-friendly)
- AngelList (startups)
- BuiltIn (tech jobs, good for juniors)
- Triplebyte (interview platform, gets you in front of companies)
- Hired (companies apply to you)
- VetsTech.Jobs (veteran job board)

**Target companies (known to hire juniors):**
- Tech giants: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook (harder but possible)
- Consulting: Accenture, Deloitte (strong junior programs)
- Mid-size tech: Stripe, Figma, Notion, Canva, HashiCorp
- Startups (VC-funded, growing): thousands of options, search on AngelList
- Local companies: often overlooked, sometimes better opportunities

**Interview Process:**

**Round 1: Phone Screen (20-30 min)**
- Usually with recruiter or hiring manager
- Behavioral: "Tell me about yourself, why this company, why this role"
- Quick coding question (if technical screen)
- Questions for them: ask about role, team, growth

**Round 2: Coding Interview (45-60 min)**
- Whiteboard or online coding problem (LeetCode-style)
- 1-2 problems, medium difficulty
- Explain your thinking as you solve
- Test your solution, handle edge cases
- Ask clarifying questions before jumping in

**Round 3: System Design / Take-home (varies)**
- Some companies do take-home project (3-8 hours of work)
- Some do system design discussion
- Shows how you'd actually work on the job

**Round 4: Team Interview / Culture Fit**
- Meet 2-4 engineers who'd be your teammates
- Behavioral focus
- Ask good questions about team, work, growth

**Negotiation:**

You have leverage. Don't be shy.

**Base salary for junior developer (2025):**
- **Low:** $65K-$75K (startup, cheaper city)
- **Mid:** $75K-$85K (mid-size company, normal cost of living)
- **High:** $85K-$100K (big tech, expensive city, with clearance)

**What to negotiate:**
- Salary (always try for +5-10K, worst they say is no)
- Signing bonus ($5-20K)
- Stock options (especially startups)
- Relocation assistance
- Work from home flexibility
- Professional development budget

**Negotiation script:**
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the role. Based on my skills and the market, I was expecting something closer to $X. Can you do $X+$5K?" Then stop talking. Let them respond.

## Real Veteran Success Stories

### Story 1: Infantry to JavaScript Developer

**Sgt. Marcus Lee (Army, 11B Infantry, 4 years)**
- **Background:** Zero tech experience, math was never his strong suit
- **Decision:** Did free coding intro week, liked it, applied to bootcamp
- **Path:** Hack Reactor 16-week full-time bootcamp ($15K from savings)
- **Bootcamp experience:** Weeks 1-3 were terrifying (everyone seemed smarter). Week 4 things clicked. By week 12 he was confident.
- **Portfolio:** Built weather app, expense tracker, and dating app (passion project)
- **Job search:** Applied to 80 companies, got 15 interviews, 3 offers
- **First job:** Junior Frontend Developer at mid-size fintech company, $78K
- **Salary progression:**
  - Year 1: $78K
  - Year 2: $95K + $20K bonus + $50K stock options
  - Year 3: Senior Developer, $140K + bonus + options
  - Year 5: Staff Engineer, $180K + significant equity

**Key lesson:** "I went in scared I wasn't smart enough. Turns out discipline beats talent. I finished when others quit. That's the only difference."

### Story 2: IT Specialist to Full-Stack Developer

**Captain Jennifer Martinez (Air Force, 3D1X2 IT Specialist, 8 years)**
- **Background:** Already technical (sysadmin, networking), had CompTIA A+
- **Decision:** Bootcamp felt like overkill, did self-taught + online courses
- **Path:** 8 months of intensive self-study (Python + JavaScript)
- **Time investment:** 25-30 hours/week while still working full-time
- **Projects:** Built 4 portfolio projects, contributed to open source
- **Certifications:** AWS Solutions Architect Associate ($150)
- **Job search:** Applied to 40 companies (technical background made her more attractive), got 8 interviews, 2 offers
- **First job:** Full-Stack Developer at health-tech startup, $82K (vs $75K typical for non-technical backgrounds)
- **Advantage:** Prior tech experience gave her +5-10K in salary
- **Year 5:** Senior/Lead Developer, $160K

**Key lesson:** "Having IT experience helped but didn't guarantee anything. What mattered was showing I could build real products. Portfolio was everything."

### Story 3: No Prior Experience, Older Vet to Developer

**Major Robert Chen (Marines, Supply Officer, 20 years, age 42 at transition)**
- **Background:** Non-technical, age concern, gap of 20 years since college
- **Decision:** Worried about bootcamp, did 2-week free intro course first
- **Path:** Springboard self-paced bootcamp ($9,900)
- **Reality:** Took 8 months (slower than 16-week bootcamp, but could do part-time)
- **Bootcamp help:** Mentor assigned, job search support
- **Portfolio:** Built 3 projects (all deployed and professional)
- **Job search:** Age concern was real (some companies ageist). Applied to 120 companies, got 6 interviews, 1 offer
- **First job:** Junior Developer at consulting firm (deliberately chose company that values experience), $72K
- **Salary progression:**
  - Year 1: $72K (lower than typical, age factor)
  - Year 2: $95K (once he had industry experience, age stopped mattering)
  - Year 5: Senior Developer / Tech Lead, $155K

**Key lesson:** "Age is only a barrier if you believe it is. Yes, some companies are ageist. But plenty value experience. You have to find the right companies. And once you're in, it doesn't matter—only your code matters."

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Starting with the Wrong Language

**What people do:** Pick a language based on what's "most in demand" (usually they pick whatever Reddit says)

**Better approach:** Pick JavaScript or Python. Both are great. The language matters 10% of the time. Fundamentals matter 90%.

**Impact:** Wastes time, leads to switching mid-bootcamp.

**How to avoid:** Choose one language, commit for the full bootcamp, don't switch.

### Mistake #2: Trying to Self-Teach Without Structure

**What people do:** "I'll just learn from YouTube and free courses" with no plan, no deadlines, no community.

**Reality:** 70% of people trying this give up within 3 months.

**Why:** Lack of accountability, no one cares if you stop, easy to procrastinate.

**How to avoid:** If self-teaching, join a community (Discord, Discord, Reddit), set public goals, find an accountability partner, post progress online.

### Mistake #3: Building Boring Portfolio Projects

**What people do:** Build todo lists, weather apps, calculators (exactly what every bootcamp teaches)

**Problem:** Hiring managers see 1000 portfolio apps like this. Yours blends in.

**Better approach:** Build something YOU want to exist. What problem do you have? What interests you? Build that.

**Examples:**
- Fantasy football tool (if you like football)
- Workout tracker (if you like fitness)
- Recipe database (if you like cooking)
- Discord bot (if you play games)
- Data visualization (if you like data)

**Impact:** Personal project stands out, you're more passionate about it, easier to talk about in interviews.

### Mistake #4: Obsessing Over Interview Prep Before You're Ready

**What people do:** Spend 6 months grinding LeetCode before they're ready to interview

**Reality:** LeetCode is important, but only after you can build products. Interview prep is the last step.

**Timeline:** Build portfolio projects first (months 1-6). Interview prep (months 6-8). Apply (months 7+).

**How to avoid:** Don't start interview prep until you're applying to jobs.

### Mistake #5: Lowballing Salary

**What people do:** Get first offer for $70K, accept it immediately because they're scared

**Reality:** You have leverage. Companies expect negotiation. Not negotiating costs you $100K+ over 5 years.

**How to avoid:** Always counter. Say "I was expecting $X+$5K, can you do that?" Worst they say is no.

### Mistake #6: Ignoring Networking

**What people do:** Grind LeetCode alone, apply to jobs anonymously, wonder why they're not getting interviews

**Reality:** 50%+ of jobs are filled via referrals. Networking matters.

**How to avoid:** Join tech communities, Twitter, attend meetups, message people on LinkedIn, ask for informational interviews.

## Cost Breakdown and Funding

### Option 1: Bootcamp (Recommended)

**Base cost:** $12K-$17K

**Funding sources:**
- GI Bill: Covers 100% for some schools (check Yellow Ribbon program)
- Veteran scholarships: Some bootcamps offer $500-$5K scholarships for veterans
- Income-share agreement: Pay 15-17% of salary for 2 years if you get hired (some bootcamps offer)
- Payment plans: $500-$1000/month (spread over 12-24 months)

**Net cost after funding:**
- With GI Bill: $0
- With veteran scholarship + payment plan: $3K-$8K out of pocket
- With income-share agreement: $0 upfront, ~$15K total over 2 years (if you make $70K+)

**Best case:** GI Bill covers it fully. $0 out of pocket.

### Option 2: Self-Taught

**Base cost:** $100-500
- freeCodeCamp: $0
- Codecademy: $30/month for 3-4 months = $120
- Books: $40-50 each, maybe 2 = $100
- LeetCode: $60/month for 3 months = $180
- Domain name for portfolio: $10/year
- Certification (optional): $100-200

**Total:** $400-600

**Best case:** Free with freeCodeCamp, just your time.

### Option 3: Degree (Not Recommended for Getting a Job)

**Cost:** $50K-$100K
**Funding:** Often covered by GI Bill (check specific school)
**Net cost:** Potentially $0 with GI Bill
**Timeline:** 2-4 years
**ROI:** Not worth it compared to bootcamp. Only do if you want the degree for personal reasons.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a computer science degree?**
A: No. Bootcamp or self-taught is better for getting your first job.

**Q: Will bootcamp guarantee me a job?**
A: Most quality bootcamps have 70-80% job placement within 6 months. No guarantee, but high probability. You still have to apply.

**Q: What if I fail bootcamp?**
A: Few people fail. Most people who "fail" actually just quit. If you stick it out, you'll finish. Hard ≠ failing.

**Q: How long until I'm job-ready?**
A: Bootcamp: 16 weeks. Self-taught: 6-12 months. You're job-ready when you have 3+ portfolio projects and can solve medium LeetCode problems.

**Q: Should I do bootcamp while working?**
A: No. Full-time bootcamp is intense. Trying to do it part-time while working leads to burnout or quitting.

**Q: What's the salary with a security clearance?**
A: Add $15-25K to salary immediately. Big advantage.

**Q: Can I transition to software development at 40?**
A: Yes. Age is not a barrier. Discipline is your advantage.

**Q: Will AI replace me as a junior developer?**
A: Not in the next 5 years. By year 10? Maybe. But you'll have 5 years of seniority making way more money by then. Plus, AI will raise the bar everywhere—now you'll be expected to use AI tools.

**Q: How much should I study after work?**
A: 15-25 hours per week if self-teaching. 0 hours if bootcamp (bootcamp IS your job).

**Q: What if I hate coding?**
A: You'll know by week 2 of bootcamp or month 1 of self-taught. If you hate it, stop and pick a different path (DevOps, data analyst, product manager—all use some coding but aren't pure development).
