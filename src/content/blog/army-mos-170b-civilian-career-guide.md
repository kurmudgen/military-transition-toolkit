## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 170B/170D Cyber Capabilities Developer Technicians—you're hands-on software developers and cyber tool engineers with practical skills that translate directly to high-paying civilian tech careers. Your **software development experience, cyber tool engineering, DevOps expertise, system administration, scripting/automation, Top Secret/SCI clearance, and proven ability to build and maintain operational cyber systems** make you highly valuable to tech companies, cybersecurity vendors, and defense contractors. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$95,000-$130,000** in software development, DevOps engineering, or systems engineering roles, scaling to **$130,000-$180,000+** in senior engineering, cloud architecture, or technical leadership. Experienced 170B/170Ds with strong portfolios can earn **$160,000-$250,000+** at Big Tech companies or leading cybersecurity firms.

**Note:** The Army redesignated this MOS—what was formerly 170B is now 170D Cyber Capability Developer Technician. This guide covers both designations.

Your security clearance adds **$25,000-$45,000** annual salary premium for defense contractor positions. The tech industry desperately needs developers with security backgrounds—combining software development skills with operational cyber experience and security clearance creates exceptional career opportunities.

Unlike bootcamp graduates or college CS majors with only academic experience, you've built real systems supporting actual operations. You've developed tools under operational pressure, maintained critical infrastructure, and solved real-world technical problems. That practical experience—combined with clearance—gives you significant advantage in the job market.

## What Does an Army 170B/170D Cyber Capabilities Developer Technician Do?

As a 170B/170D Cyber Capabilities Developer Technician, you developed, implemented, tested, and maintained software and hardware solutions enabling cyberspace operations. You were the hands-on engineer building cyber tools, maintaining infrastructure, automating operations, and ensuring cyber capabilities functioned correctly in operational environments.

Your responsibilities included software development (Python, PowerShell, Bash, Java, C/C++), system administration (Linux and Windows), infrastructure management, DevOps pipeline implementation, cyber tool customization and integration, database management, network configuration, troubleshooting and technical support, and maintaining operational security of cyber systems.

You worked directly with operators, receiving immediate feedback on tools and capabilities. You debugged code in production, fixed critical issues under time pressure, and ensured systems stayed operational 24/7. You held Top Secret/SCI clearance and maintained classified cyber infrastructure supporting offensive and defensive operations.

Unlike 17D officers who managed programs, you were the technician—writing code, configuring servers, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring operators had functioning tools.

- "Developed 20+ Python automation scripts saving 600+ hours annually"
- "Maintained 50+ production servers with zero security incidents"
- "Led infrastructure migration to cloud reducing costs by 35%"

## Transition Timeline

### 6-12 Months Before Separation

**Month 1-2:**
- Build GitHub portfolio showcasing scripts and automation tools
- Decide: DevOps vs. software development vs. systems engineering vs. cybersecurity
- Update LinkedIn emphasizing technical skills
- Connect with 20+ former 170B/170Ds

**Month 3-4:**
- Complete cloud certification (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Start LeetCode if pursuing software development
- Apply for SkillBridge at tech companies
- Update resume translating military experience

**Month 5-6:**
- Complete Kubernetes certification (CKA)
- Practice technical interviews
- Apply to 30+ companies
- Join tech Slack communities, attend local meetups

### 3-6 Months Before Separation

- Apply to 50+ positions across tech, cybersecurity, defense
- Accept SkillBridge if offered
- Build personal projects (deploy app to AWS, automate infrastructure, contribute to open source)
- Network with recruiters specializing in tech veterans

### Final 3 Months

- Accept offer aligning with career goals
- Negotiate total compensation (salary + equity + sign-on)
- Ensure cleared positions maintain clearance
- Complete separation paperwork
- Join professional communities: DevOps subreddits, cloud user groups

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1: Not showcasing technical skills**
Create GitHub portfolio. Build personal projects. Demonstrate you can code, automate, and solve problems.

**Mistake #2: Undervaluing your experience**
You've maintained operational systems under pressure. That's harder than most corporate IT. Don't undersell yourself.

**Mistake #3: Only targeting defense contractors**
Defense pays $90K-$150K. Tech companies pay $140K-$300K+. At least explore commercial opportunities.

**Mistake #4: Skipping certifications**
Cloud certifications (AWS, Azure) are worth $15K-$30K in salary. They're $165-$395 and 2-3 months of study. ROI is immediate.

**Mistake #5: Letting clearance lapse**
Take cleared job within 2 years or lose $25K-$45K salary premium.

**Mistake #6: Poor resume translation**
Don't write "maintained cyber infrastructure." Write "managed AWS infrastructure supporting 24/7 operations with 99.9% uptime."
