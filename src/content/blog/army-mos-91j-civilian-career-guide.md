I just earned my EPA 608 certification and I'm looking for entry-level technician opportunities. Are you hiring?" Many smaller companies hire based on phone calls and walk-ins, not formal applications.

## Interview Preparation

Practice answering these common questions for maintenance and technical roles:

**Q: Tell me about your maintenance experience.**
A: "As an Army Quartermaster and Chemical Equipment Repairer, I maintained complex systems including reverse osmosis water purification units, forced-air heating systems, hydraulic equipment, and electrical components. I diagnosed failures using technical manuals and test equipment, performed preventive maintenance, and trained junior soldiers. I worked in field environments where equipment reliability was critical, so I developed strong troubleshooting skills and attention to detail."

**Q: Describe a time you diagnosed and fixed a complex equipment failure.**
A: [Use STAR method] "During a field exercise, our water purification system stopped producing clean water—a critical issue for 200+ soldiers. I systematically tested components, identified a failed pressure sensor affecting the RO membrane, and replaced it using available parts. I restored the system to full operation within 3 hours, ensuring the unit had safe drinking water. This required reading technical schematics, using diagnostic tools, and working under pressure with a clear deadline."

**Q: What do you know about HVAC systems?**
A: "I maintained forced-air heaters and climate control systems in the Army, which involved troubleshooting combustion components, electrical controls, blowers, and ventilation systems. I recently earned my EPA 608 Universal Certification, so I understand refrigeration cycles, refrigerant handling, and system diagnostics. I'm eager to expand my HVAC knowledge through on-the-job training and manufacturer certifications."

**Q: How do you prioritize multiple maintenance requests?**
A: "I prioritize based on safety, mission impact, and urgency. Life-safety issues come first—anything affecting people's safety or health. Next are critical systems affecting operations. Then routine maintenance and non-urgent repairs. In the Army, we used this approach to keep equipment operational during deployments, and I'd apply the same logic to facility or plant maintenance."

**Q: Describe your experience with preventive maintenance programs.**
A: "I followed Army technical manuals that specified maintenance intervals and inspection procedures. I documented all maintenance actions, tracked service schedules, and ensured equipment reliability through regular inspections and lubrication. I understand that preventive maintenance reduces costly breakdowns and extends equipment life—that's valuable to any facility or plant."

**Q: What safety training do you have?**
A: "I completed OSHA 10-hour safety training and I'm trained in lockout/tagout procedures, electrical safety, confined space entry, and hazardous material handling from my military work with chemical equipment. Safety was non-negotiable in the Army, and I bring that same mindset to civilian work."

**Q: Are you comfortable working on-call or rotating shifts?**
A: "Yes. In the Army, I worked field exercises, deployments, and irregular schedules. I'm accustomed to responding to equipment failures at any hour and working whatever schedule the mission requires. I understand that maintenance doesn't stop at 5 PM."

**Q: What are your salary expectations?**
A: [Research local market rates first] "Based on my research, entry-level HVAC technicians in this area earn $42K-$52K. Given my experience maintaining HVAC, hydraulic, and electrical systems and my EPA 608 certification, I'm targeting the $45K-$50K range, but I'm flexible based on training opportunities and benefits."

**Q: Why should we hire you over other candidates?**
A: "I bring proven troubleshooting skills, hands-on experience with HVAC and water systems, EPA 608 certification, and a strong work ethic. In the Army, equipment failure wasn't an option—I learned to diagnose problems efficiently and fix them right the first time. I'm reliable, safety-conscious, and I'm committed to learning your systems and processes quickly. I'm looking for a long-term career, not just a job."

**Q: What are your career goals?**
A: "Short-term, I want to become a skilled [HVAC/facilities/water treatment] technician, earn additional certifications, and build a reputation for quality work. Long-term, I'm interested in advancing to senior technician or supervisor roles where I can mentor others and take on more responsibility. I'm committed to continuous learning and becoming an expert in this field."

**Q: Do you have any questions for us?**
A: (Always ask questions—shows interest)
- "What does a typical day look like for this position?"
- "What manufacturer certifications or training opportunities do you offer?"
- "How do you support professional development and advancement for technicians?"
- "What are the biggest maintenance challenges your facility faces?"
- "What's the on-call rotation for this role?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Not getting EPA 608 certification before applying for HVAC jobs.**
You legally can't work with refrigerants without it. Get it first—it's quick, affordable, and mandatory. Many employers won't even interview you without it.

**Mistake 2: Using military jargon in resumes and interviews.**
Don't say "ROWPU," "TM 10-4610," "DA Form," or "motor pool." Say "reverse osmosis water purification system," "technical service manual," "maintenance documentation," and "equipment repair facility." Translate everything to civilian language.

**Mistake 3: Applying only online and never following up.**
Online applications disappear into black holes. Call employers directly, visit facilities in person (for smaller companies), and network. Many maintenance jobs are filled through referrals and direct contact, not job boards.

**Mistake 4: Expecting military pay equivalency immediately.**
Army E-5 with 6 years makes $40K-$50K base pay (plus benefits). Entry-level civilian maintenance jobs pay similarly ($40K-$50K), but benefits vary. Don't let pride stop you from taking entry-level positions—you'll advance quickly with your skills.

**Mistake 5: Not researching state and local licensing requirements.**
Some states require HVAC technician licenses or apprenticeship registration. Some water treatment facilities require state operator licenses. Research before you relocate or apply—requirements vary significantly by state.

**Mistake 6: Ignoring union opportunities.**
IBEW, UA, and other unions offer paid apprenticeships leading to $70K-$90K+ journeyman positions. Don't dismiss union paths because apprentice pay starts lower—the long-term earning potential and benefits are excellent.

**Mistake 7: Focusing only on "cool" jobs and ignoring stable, well-paying careers.**
Water treatment operators aren't glamorous, but they earn $55K-$75K with government benefits, pensions, and job security. Facilities maintenance isn't exciting, but it's steady work with regular hours. Don't overlook solid careers because they seem boring.
