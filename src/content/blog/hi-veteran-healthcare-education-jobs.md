# Hawaii Veterans: VA Healthcare, University Programs & Military Employment 2025

Hawaii serves approximately 89,000 veterans - representing 8.2% of the state's adult population, one of the highest percentages per capita in the United States. Hawaii's military presence drives this veteran concentration: Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Schofield Barracks, and Marine Corps Base Hawaii employ thousands of active duty personnel who eventually retire here.

Veterans in Hawaii have access to quality VA healthcare (though limited to one medical center on Oahu), strong education benefits through the University of Hawaii system, and substantial military employment opportunities. But Hawaii's geographic isolation means outer island veterans face significant healthcare access challenges.

This guide provides real addresses, phone numbers, and actionable information for Hawaii veterans.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Healthcare**: 1 VA medical center (Honolulu/Oahu), 4 outer island clinics (Maui, Big Island x2, Kauai), extensive use of VA Community Care for neighbor islands

**Education**: University of Hawaii system with robust veteran support, in-state tuition for GI Bill users, Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH rates $2,100-$2,700/month (among highest in nation)

**Employment**: Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (largest employer), Schofield Barracks, Marine Corps Base Hawaii Kaneohe, limited civilian opportunities outside military/government/tourism

**Veteran Population**: 89,000+ veterans, heavily concentrated on Oahu (60-70%), strong military culture, high per capita rate

**Challenge**: Geographic isolation creates healthcare access issues for neighbor island veterans - Maui, Big Island, and Kauai residents must fly to Oahu for complex care

## VA Healthcare Facilities in Hawaii

### VA Medical Centers

**Main Phone**: (808) 433-0600
**Toll-Free**: 1-800-214-1306

### Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs)

#### Maui VA Clinic (Kahului)

**Address**: 203 Ho'ohana Street, Suite 303, Kahului, HI 96732
**Phone**: (808) 871-2454
**Hours**: Monday-Friday, 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM

**Services**: Primary care, mental health, laboratory, telehealth

**Serves**: Maui County (Maui, Molokai, Lanai)

**For complex care**: Must fly to Honolulu (30-minute flight, $100-$300 round-trip depending on airline and booking)

**Travel reimbursement**: Available for veterans traveling to Honolulu for VA care (see details below)

#### Hilo VA Clinic (Big Island - East Side)

**Address**: 45 Mohouli Street, Hilo, HI 96720
**Phone**: (808) 935-3781
**Hours**: Monday-Friday, 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM

**Services**: Primary care, mental health, laboratory, telehealth

**Serves**: East Hawaii (Hilo, Puna, Hamakua, Ka'u)

**Note**: Hilo is the rainier, more affordable side of the Big Island. Clinic serves approximately 3,000+ enrolled veterans in East Hawaii.

#### Kailua-Kona VA Clinic (Big Island - West Side)

**Address**: 73-5618 Maiau Street, Kamanu Center, Suite C200, Kailua-Kona, HI 96740
**Phone**: (808) 329-0774

**Services**: Primary care, mental health, laboratory, telehealth

**Serves**: West Hawaii (Kona, Kohala, Waimea)

**Note**: Kona side is sunnier, more expensive, and popular with retirees. Having two Big Island clinics (Hilo and Kona) is critical given the 90-mile distance between them.

#### Lihue VA Clinic (Kauai)

**Address**: 4485 Pahe'e Street, Suite 150, Lihue, HI 96766
**Phone**: (808) 246-0497
**Hours**: Monday-Friday, 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM

**Services**: Primary care, mental health, laboratory, telehealth

**Serves**: Kauai County (entire island)

**Note**: Kauai is the most isolated neighbor island for VA care - 25-minute flight to Honolulu, flights less frequent than Maui/Big Island

### VA Community Care Network - Critical for Hawaii

Given Hawaii's geographic challenges, the VA Community Care Network is essential. Veterans can receive care from civilian providers when:
- Service not available at VA facility
- Wait times exceed VA standards
- Travel distance to VA facility is prohibitive
- Emergency care needed

**How to access Community Care**:
1. Call VA Community Care call center: 1-877-881-7618
2. VA will authorize care and arrange civilian provider
3. VA pays directly (you don't pay out of pocket)
4. Works with Hawaii's major healthcare systems (Straub, Kaiser, Queens, Kapiolani, etc.)

**Critical for neighbor island veterans**: If you live on Maui, Big Island, or Kauai and need specialty care not available at your local clinic, Community Care allows you to see specialists locally instead of flying to Oahu.

### Travel Reimbursement for VA Care

Veterans traveling more than 100 miles round-trip to VA facilities can claim travel reimbursement.

**Rates (2025)**:
- Mileage: $0.415 per mile for vehicle travel
- Airfare: Actual cost of common carrier (inter-island flights)
- Lodging: $157/night if overnight stay required
- Meals: $62/day

**How to file**:
- File claim at VA facility after appointment
- Online: [va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay](https://www.va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay/)
- Reimbursement typically processed within 30 days

**Example**: Veteran on Kauai flying to Honolulu for specialty appointment
- Round-trip airfare: $200
- VA reimburses: $200
- Makes outer island care more affordable

### Vet Centers (Readjustment Counseling)

Vet Centers provide free, confidential counseling separate from VA medical facilities. No VA healthcare enrollment required.

**Address**: 1680 Kapiolani Boulevard, Suite F-3, Honolulu, HI 96814

**Who can use Vet Centers**: Combat veterans, sexual trauma survivors, family members, and survivors of service members who died while on active duty

**No VA enrollment required**: Vet Centers operate independently - you can use them without enrolling in VA healthcare

### Wait Times and Access

**Average wait times at Honolulu VA Medical Center**:
- Primary care: 7-21 days for new appointments, 3-7 days for established patients
- Mental health: 7-14 days
- Specialty care: 14-45 days depending on specialty

**Outer island clinics**: Generally faster for primary care and mental health (smaller patient populations)

**Quality ratings**: VA Pacific Islands Healthcare System receives average to above-average patient satisfaction scores. Limited specialty services are the main complaint, not quality of care.

**Best practice for Hawaii veterans**:
1. Enroll in VA healthcare immediately upon separation
2. Establish care at your local clinic
3. Request telehealth for routine follow-ups
4. Plan ahead for specialty care (may require Oahu travel)
5. Consider VA Community Care for urgent specialty needs

### Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits - In-State Tuition

Under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA), veterans using GI Bill benefits qualify for **in-state tuition at Hawaii public universities** regardless of residency status.

**Eligibility**:
- Using Post-9/11 GI Bill, Montgomery GI Bill, or VR&E
- Living in Hawaii while attending school
- Enrolling within 3 years of separation from active duty

**Savings**: Out-of-state tuition at UH Mānoa is $34,000/year vs. in-state $12,000/year - that's $22,000 annual savings automatically.

**Spouse and dependent benefits**: Spouses and dependents using transferred GI Bill benefits also qualify for in-state tuition rates if the service member is on active duty in Hawaii.

### GI Bill BAH Rates - Among Highest in Nation

Hawaii's Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH rates are among the highest in the United States, helping offset Hawaii's brutal cost of living.

**Monthly BAH rates (100% benefit, 2025)**:
- **Honolulu/Oahu**: $2,700/month
- **Maui County**: $2,400/month
- **Big Island (Hilo)**: $2,100/month
- **Big Island (Kona)**: $2,250/month
- **Kauai**: $2,200/month

**National average**: ~$1,800/month

**Annual BAH (9 months academic year)**:
- Honolulu: $24,300
- Combined with tuition coverage: $36,300 total annual benefit

**Reality check**: Even with $2,700/month BAH, you'll struggle in Hawaii. Rent for 1BR apartment in Honolulu is $1,800-$2,500/month, leaving $200-$900 for food, utilities, transportation, and everything else.

**Strategy for student veterans in Hawaii**:
1. Live with roommates to split rent
2. Consider on-campus or military base housing
3. Work part-time (GI Bill covers full-time school + BAH)
4. Use food banks and veteran support programs
5. Budget aggressively

### Vocational Training and Apprenticeships

GI Bill covers vocational training and apprenticeships in Hawaii.

**GI Bill-approved programs**:
- Welding (high demand in Hawaii)
- HVAC (critical for island climate)
- Electrical work
- Plumbing
- Aviation maintenance (major industry in Hawaii)
- Heavy equipment operation
- Diesel mechanics
- Commercial diving
- Marine trades

**Apprenticeships**: GI Bill monthly housing allowance for apprenticeships decreases over time:
- Months 1-6: 100% of BAH rate
- Months 7-12: 80% of BAH rate
- Months 13-18: 60% of BAH rate
- Months 19-24: 40% of BAH rate
- Months 25+: 20% of BAH rate

## Geographic Challenges for Hawaii Veterans

### Healthcare Access on Neighbor Islands

**The reality**: If you live on Maui, Big Island, or Kauai, you have limited local VA services.

**What's available locally**:
- Primary care
- Mental health counseling
- Basic laboratory work
- Telehealth

**What requires Oahu travel**:
- Most specialty care (cardiology, neurology, surgery, etc.)
- Complex diagnostics (MRI, CT scans)
- Surgical procedures
- Specialty mental health programs

**Options**:
1. **Fly to Oahu for care**: Expensive ($200-$400 round-trip) even with travel reimbursement
2. **VA Community Care**: See local civilian specialists (VA authorization required)
3. **Telehealth**: Works for consultations but not procedures

**Travel reimbursement helps** but doesn't fully offset costs (lodging, meals, time off work)

### Cost of Living Impact on Benefits

**VA disability compensation is the same nationwide**:
- 100% disabled veteran: $3,737.85/month (2025 rate)
- Same in Hawaii as Alabama

**But Hawaii costs 84% more than national average**:
- $3,737/month buys far less in Hawaii than mainland
- Rent alone can consume $2,000-$3,000/month
- Groceries: $600-$800/month for single person

**GI Bill BAH rates are location-adjusted**:
- Honolulu: $2,700/month (helps offset costs)
- Still not enough to live comfortably without additional income

**Federal employment locality pay**:
- Hawaii federal employees receive 25-30% locality adjustment
- Helps but doesn't fully offset 84% higher cost of living

### Island Isolation

**Hawaii is 2,500 miles from mainland**:
- Flights to West Coast: $300-$800 round-trip
- 5-6 hour flight time
- Difficult and expensive to visit family on mainland

**Interisland travel**:
- Oahu to Maui/Big Island/Kauai: 30-45 minute flights
- $80-$300 round-trip depending on airline and booking
- Necessary for VA healthcare, shopping, family visits

**Shipping goods**:
- Everything shipped from mainland (drives up costs)
- Jones Act requires U.S.-flagged ships (expensive)
- Amazon shipping sometimes slower or unavailable

**For veterans**: Geographic isolation can worsen mental health conditions. If you need frequent family contact or struggle with isolation, Hawaii's distance from mainland can be challenging.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Healthcare is concentrated on Oahu** - neighbor island veterans face travel burden for complex care

2. **University of Hawaii offers strong veteran support** - 2,000+ student veterans, dedicated services, high GI Bill BAH rates

3. **Federal employment dominates veteran jobs** - JBPHH, Schofield, MCBH employ thousands of veterans

4. **Private sector jobs are limited** outside military, government, tourism, and healthcare

5. **VA Community Care is critical** for neighbor island veterans to access specialty care locally

6. **GI Bill BAH rates are high** ($2,100-$2,700/month) but still insufficient for comfortable living without additional income or roommates

7. **Geographic isolation creates challenges** - expensive inter-island and mainland travel, mental health impact

8. **Strong veteran community** - 89,000 veterans, high per capita rate, military culture embedded in Hawaii society

Hawaii's veteran support infrastructure is strong where it exists (Oahu) but limited on neighbor islands.
