# VA Disability Rating for Major Depressive Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9434** with ratings from **0% to 100%** using the same General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders as PTSD. Most veterans with diagnosed depression receive **30-70%** depending on how severely symptoms affect work, relationships, and daily functioning. Depression is commonly claimed as **secondary** to chronic pain conditions (back, knees), sleep apnea, PTSD, or other service-connected disabilities. The key to getting an appropriate rating is clearly documenting how your depression affects your **occupational and social functioning**—not just listing symptoms. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Major Depressive Disorder and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Major Depressive Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest or pleasure in activities. It affects how you think, feel, and handle daily activities, and must be present for at least two weeks to meet diagnostic criteria.

**Symptoms of MDD include:**
- Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood
- Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
- Irritability
- Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
- Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
- Decreased energy or fatigue
- Moving or talking more slowly
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
- Difficulty sleeping (insomnia) or oversleeping
- Appetite and/or weight changes
- Thoughts of death or suicide
- Physical aches or pains without clear physical cause

**Military connections to depression:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Traumatic events during service
- Chronic stress of military life
- Separation from family
- Combat exposure
- Loss of fellow service members
- Moral injury
- High-stress operational environments

**Secondary service connection (common path):**
- **Chronic pain conditions**: Back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain → depression
- **PTSD**: Often co-occurs with depression
- **Sleep apnea/sleep disorders**: Sleep deprivation worsens mood
- **TBI**: Brain injury affects mood regulation
- **Tinnitus**: Constant noise causes frustration and depression
- **Any chronic disability**: Living with limitations causes depression

**Aggravation during service:**
- Pre-existing depression worsened by military stress
- Exacerbation during deployments or training

## VA Rating Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder

MDD is rated under **38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders—the same criteria used for PTSD and all mental health conditions.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mental condition diagnosed, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication |
| **10%** | Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, OR symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **30%** | Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss |
| **50%** | Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships |
| **70%** | Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name |

### Key Points About MDD Ratings

**The symptoms listed are examples, not requirements:**
You don't need every listed symptom. What matters is your overall level of occupational and social impairment.

**30% is a common starting point** for diagnosed depression with moderate symptoms.

**50% indicates meaningful impairment** affecting your reliability at work and relationships.

**70% requires deficiencies in "most areas"** (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood)—you don't need all, but most.

**100% requires "total" impairment**—essentially inability to work or function in any relationships.

### Mental Health Conditions Rated Together

If you have multiple mental health conditions (depression + anxiety, or depression + PTSD), they are typically rated together under one percentage using the General Rating Formula. The VA looks at your overall mental health impairment, not each condition separately.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**For direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing depression diagnosis or treatment
- Mental health counseling records from service
- Documentation of stressful events during service
- Performance evaluations showing decline
- Buddy statements about behavioral changes

**For secondary service connection (most common):**
- Already service-connected condition (chronic pain, PTSD, etc.)
- Nexus statement from mental health provider explaining:
  - How your service-connected condition causes depression
  - The physiological or psychological mechanism

**Example secondary connection:**
"Veteran's chronic lower back pain (service-connected) has limited his mobility, caused sleep disturbance, and prevented him from engaging in activities he previously enjoyed. These factors have directly contributed to the development of major depressive disorder."

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA mental health evaluation** diagnosing MDD
2. **Private psychiatrist or psychologist diagnosis** with nexus statement
3. **Treatment records showing:**
   - Ongoing therapy
   - Medication prescriptions
   - Hospitalizations (if any)
   - Frequency and duration of treatment

### Severity Evidence

**Document how depression affects these areas:**

1. **Occupational functioning:**
   - Jobs lost due to depression
   - Conflicts with coworkers
   - Missed workdays
   - Inability to concentrate or complete tasks
   - Performance issues
   - Underemployment

2. **Social functioning:**
   - Relationship problems
   - Divorce or separation
   - Withdrawal from family
   - Loss of friendships
   - Social isolation

3. **Daily functioning:**
   - Sleep problems
   - Appetite changes
   - Hygiene neglect
   - Inability to complete household tasks
   - Loss of interest in activities
   - Energy levels

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The depression C&P exam typically lasts 30-60 minutes and is crucial for your rating.

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about onset of depression symptoms
3. Assess current symptom severity
4. Evaluate occupational and social impairment
5. Complete a Mental Disorders DBQ

**Questions you'll be asked:**

**About history:**
- "When did you first notice depressive symptoms?"
- "What do you think caused your depression?"
- "What treatment have you received?"

**About current symptoms:**
- "How is your mood most days?"
- "Do you have trouble sleeping?"
- "Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?"
- "Do you have thoughts of hurting yourself?"
- "How is your energy level?"
- "How is your concentration?"

**About functional impairment:**
- "How does your depression affect your work?"
- "How does it affect your relationships?"
- "Can you describe a typical day?"
- "What activities have you stopped doing?"

**What to tell them (be honest and complete):**

1. **Describe your worst days**, not your best
2. **Give specific examples**: "I called in sick 15 days last year because I couldn't get out of bed"
3. **Mention suicidal thoughts** if you've had them—this is important for 70% rating
4. **Describe relationship impacts**: "My wife left because I became withdrawn and irritable"
5. **Don't minimize**: This isn't the time to be stoic

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Saying "I'm fine" or minimizing**: Be honest about impairment
- **Not mentioning suicidal ideation**: If you've had thoughts, say so (even passive thoughts count)
- **Being too brief**: Provide detailed examples
- **Appearing "too put together"**: Don't dress up or try to seem okay
- **Focusing only on symptoms**: Explain functional impact

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Depression

Depression often connects to other conditions:

1. **Anxiety Disorder** - DC 9400
   - Commonly co-occurs with depression
   - Usually rated together
   - May justify higher single rating

2. **PTSD** - DC 9411
   - Often co-occurs with MDD
   - Rated together under one percentage

3. **Sleep Disorders** - DC 6847, 8108
   - Depression affects sleep
   - Sleep deprivation worsens depression

4. **Chronic Pain Conditions** (claim MDD secondary to these)
   - Back pain → depression
   - Knee pain → depression
   - Any chronic pain → depression

5. **GERD** - DC 7346
   - Stress and depression affect digestive system
   - Can be secondary to depression

6. **Migraines** - DC 8100
   - Depression associated with headaches
   - Stress triggers migraines

7. **Erectile Dysfunction** - DC 7522
   - Depression and medications affect sexual function
   - Very common secondary claim

8. **Weight Changes**
   - Depression causes weight gain or loss
   - Can contribute to other health issues

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "No nexus to military service"
**Why it happens:** Examiner can't connect depression to service
**How to avoid:**
- Document in-service stressors
- Establish secondary connection to service-connected condition
- Get private nexus opinion

### 2. "No current diagnosis"
**Why it happens:** C&P examiner diagnoses different condition or no MDD
**How to avoid:**
- Get private diagnosis before filing
- Ensure symptoms meet DSM-5 criteria
- Be thorough in describing all symptoms

### 3. "Symptoms don't meet criteria for claimed rating"
**Why it happens:** Underreporting at exam
**How to avoid:**
- Describe functional impairment in detail
- Give specific examples
- Mention worst days, not best

### 4. "Depression attributed to non-service causes"
**Why it happens:** Examiner blames civilian life events
**How to avoid:**
- Focus on service-connected conditions as cause
- Explain timeline (depression started during service or after service-connected condition)
- Get nexus opinion addressing causation

### 5. "Condition existed before service"
**Why it happens:** Pre-service mental health history
**How to avoid:**
- Argue aggravation during service
- Document worsening during service
- Show increased treatment needs after service

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim depression secondary to chronic pain?
Yes. Chronic pain causing depression is one of the most common and accepted secondary claims. Medical research clearly supports the connection.

### Will claiming depression affect my security clearance?
Seeking mental health treatment should not automatically disqualify you. Untreated conditions are more concerning to adjudicators than treated ones.

### Can I claim depression and anxiety separately?
Typically, mental health conditions are rated together under one percentage. Claiming both may result in a higher single rating rather than two separate ratings.

### What if my depression has gotten worse?
File a claim for increased rating. Provide current treatment records, updated personal statement, and any evidence of worsening.

### Can I be 100% for depression alone?
Yes, if your depression causes total occupational and social impairment. This requires severe symptoms like inability to work or maintain any relationships.

### What's the difference between depression and adjustment disorder?
MDD requires symptoms meeting specific criteria for at least two weeks. Adjustment disorder is a reaction to a specific stressor and may not meet full MDD criteria. MDD is generally considered more chronic/severe.

### Should I mention past suicide attempts or hospitalization?
Yes. This is relevant medical history that supports the severity of your condition and need for higher rating.
