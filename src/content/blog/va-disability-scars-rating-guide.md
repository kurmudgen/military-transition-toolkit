# VA Disability Rating for Scars: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Scars are rated under **Diagnostic Codes 7800-7805** with ratings from **0% to 80%**, depending on location, size, and characteristics. The VA rates scars based on whether they're **on the head/face/neck** (disfigurement ratings), cause **pain**, are **unstable** (frequently break down), or **limit motion** of the affected area. Each scar can be rated separately, and you can receive multiple ratings for multiple scars. Painful scars automatically receive **10%** each. Service connection is usually straightforward if the scar resulted from service injuries or surgeries. Claims typically take 2-4 months.

## What Are Ratable Scars and How Does Military Service Cause Them?

Scars are permanent marks left after wound healing. The VA rates scars that cause functional impairment, pain, or disfigurement. Military service commonly causes scars through:

**Combat injuries:**
- Gunshot wounds
- Shrapnel/fragmentation injuries
- Burns (fire, explosions, hot surfaces)
- Blast injuries
- Lacerations from equipment or debris

**Training and operational injuries:**
- Falls and lacerations
- Burns from equipment
- Sports injuries requiring stitches
- Accident injuries
- Animal bites (military working dogs, etc.)

**Surgical scars from service-connected conditions:**
- Orthopedic surgery scars (knee, shoulder, back)
- Abdominal surgery scars
- Hernia repair scars
- Any surgery to treat service-connected condition

**Other service-related scars:**
- Vaccination scars
- IV/needle scars
- Skin condition scarring

## VA Rating Criteria for Scars

The VA uses multiple diagnostic codes to rate scars, depending on their location and characteristics.

### DC 7800 - Burn Scars or Disfigurement of Head, Face, or Neck

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | One characteristic of disfigurement |
| **30%** | Visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes, ears, cheeks, lips), OR two or three characteristics of disfigurement |
| **50%** | Visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features, OR four or five characteristics of disfigurement |
| **80%** | Visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features, OR six or more characteristics of disfigurement |

**The 8 Characteristics of Disfigurement:**
1. Scar 5 or more inches (13 cm) in length
2. Scar at least 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) wide at widest part
3. Surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation
4. Scar adherent to underlying tissue
5. Skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding 6 square inches (39 sq cm)
6. Skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly) in area exceeding 6 square inches
7. Underlying soft tissue missing in area exceeding 6 square inches
8. Skin indurated and inflexible in area exceeding 6 square inches

### DC 7801 - Burn Scars or Scars Due to Other Causes, Not of Head, Face, or Neck (Deep Nonlinear)

Scars that are deep (associated with underlying soft tissue damage) or that cause limited motion:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq cm) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq cm) |
| **20%** | Area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 sq cm) but less than 72 square inches (465 sq cm) |
| **30%** | Area or areas of at least 72 square inches (465 sq cm) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq cm) |
| **40%** | Area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq cm) or greater |

**Note:** A deep scar is one associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

### DC 7802 - Burn Scars or Scars Due to Other Causes, Not of Head, Face, or Neck (Superficial Nonlinear)

Scars that are superficial (not associated with underlying soft tissue damage) and do not cause limited motion:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq cm) or greater |

**Note:** A superficial scar is one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

### DC 7804 - Unstable or Painful Scars

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | One or two scars that are unstable or painful |
| **20%** | Three or four scars that are unstable or painful |
| **30%** | Five or more scars that are unstable or painful |

**Note:** An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. If one or more scars are both unstable AND painful, add 10% to the rating.

### DC 7805 - Other Scars and Effects

Scars may also be rated on any limitation of function of the affected part. For example:
- A scar on the knee that limits knee flexion would be rated under knee limitation codes
- A scar on the arm that limits elbow motion would be rated under elbow codes

This is IN ADDITION to other scar ratings, not instead of.

### Key Points for Maximizing Scar Ratings

1. **Each painful scar = 10%**: If you have 5 painful scars, that's 30%
2. **Scars can be rated under multiple codes**: A large, painful scar could get ratings under both DC 7801 and DC 7804
3. **Surgical scars count**: Scars from surgery to treat service-connected conditions are service-connected
4. **Measure all scars**: Small scars might not seem significant but can add up
5. **Document instability**: If scars frequently break open or bleed, document it

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**For scars from service injuries:**
- Service treatment records showing the injury
- Emergency room or surgical records
- Line of duty determination
- Incident reports
- Photos from during/after service

**For surgical scars:**
- Documentation that the surgery was for a service-connected condition
- The underlying condition must be service-connected first

**For scars without documentation:**
- Buddy statements about the injury
- Photos showing scars from military time period
- Medical records noting the scar with history of military origin

### Current Condition Evidence

1. **C&P exam documentation**
2. **Photographs of all scars:**
   - Include a ruler for size reference
   - Multiple angles
   - Close-up and wider shots

3. **Medical records describing:**
   - Location of each scar
   - Size (length and width)
   - Whether deep or superficial
   - Pain level
   - Instability (if applicable)
   - Any limitation of function

### Severity Evidence

1. **Personal statement describing:**
   - Pain with each scar
   - Sensitivity (to touch, clothing, temperature)
   - Instability episodes (frequency, triggers)
   - Functional limitations
   - Cosmetic/psychological impact

2. **Treatment records for:**
   - Pain management
   - Wound care (for unstable scars)
   - Scar revision surgery
   - Dermatology treatment

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The scar C&P exam is relatively straightforward but thorough documentation matters.

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about each scar's origin
3. **Measure each scar** (length, width, area)
4. Assess depth (deep vs. superficial)
5. Check for pain on examination
6. Check for instability
7. Assess surface characteristics (texture, contour, adhesion)
8. Evaluate any functional limitation
9. For head/face/neck scars, assess disfigurement characteristics

**What to tell them:**

1. **Identify every scar**: Point out all service-related scars, even small ones
2. **Report all painful scars**: "This scar hurts when touched/when wearing clothes"
3. **Describe instability**: "This scar breaks open about once a month"
4. **Explain functional limitations**: "This scar limits how far I can bend my knee"
5. **Don't forget hidden scars**: Scars under clothing, on back, etc.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Forgetting scars**: List all scars before the exam
- **Not reporting pain**: If it hurts, say so
- **Underreporting instability**: Document every time a scar breaks down
- **Not mentioning surgical scars**: Scars from service-connected surgeries count
- **Wearing clothes that hide scars**: Wear clothing that allows easy examination

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Scars

Scars can be associated with other conditions:

1. **Limitation of Motion** - Various codes
   - If scar restricts joint movement
   - Rated under appropriate joint code

2. **Muscle Injuries** - DC 5301-5323
   - If scar is from injury that damaged muscle
   - Separate rating for muscle injury

3. **Nerve Damage** - DC 8510-8730
   - Numbness or tingling around scar
   - Nerve damage from original injury

4. **Skin Conditions** - DC 7806, 7813
   - Dermatitis around scar
   - Keloid formation

5. **Depression/Anxiety** - DC 9434, 9400
   - Psychological impact of disfigurement
   - Especially for visible scars

6. **Headaches** - DC 8100
   - If head/face scars cause headaches

7. **Underlying Conditions**
   - The condition that caused the scar
   - (e.g., GSW residuals beyond the scar itself)

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "Scar not service-connected"
**Why it happens:** No documentation linking scar to service
**How to avoid:**
- Get buddy statements about injuries
- Connect surgical scars to service-connected conditions
- Provide photos from service period if available

### 2. "Scar not painful or unstable"
**Why it happens:** Pain or instability not reported at exam
**How to avoid:**
- Clearly report pain at exam
- Document instability episodes before exam
- Describe specific symptoms

### 3. "Scar doesn't meet size criteria"
**Why it happens:** Scar too small for size-based ratings
**How to avoid:**
- Focus on pain/instability ratings instead
- Ensure accurate measurement at exam
- Claim all scars (combined area)

### 4. "No functional limitation"
**Why it happens:** Examiner didn't find limitation of motion
**How to avoid:**
- Demonstrate how scar restricts movement
- Describe daily activities affected
- Get physical therapy documentation

### 5. "Surgical scar for non-service-connected condition"
**Why it happens:** Underlying condition wasn't service-connected
**How to avoid:**
- Ensure underlying condition is service-connected first
- File claims in correct order

## Buddy Statement Tips for Scars

**For fellow service members:**
- Describe the injury that caused the scar
- Confirm when and how it happened
- Note treatment you witnessed

**For family members:**
- Describe pain behaviors you've observed
- Note when scar breaks down (instability)
- Compare appearance before and after service

**Example:**
"I am the spouse of [Veteran's Name]. I have observed that the scar on their [location] causes them significant pain. They wince when clothing touches it and frequently complain about discomfort. The scar on their [other location] breaks open approximately once every [timeframe], requiring bandaging and wound care. I have personally treated these episodes on numerous occasions. These scars have noticeably affected their quality of life and daily activities."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** Measurement errors, missed scars, ignored symptoms
**When to use:** If examiner didn't properly document all scars or characteristics

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Adding evidence of pain, instability, or missed scars
**What to submit:**
- Photos with measurements
- Treatment records for scar issues
- Buddy statements about observed symptoms

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex cases involving multiple scars
**When to use:** If HLR unsuccessful

**Scar-specific appeal tips:**
- Request new exam if examiner missed scars
- Provide photographic evidence of instability episodes
- Document ongoing pain through medical records
- Calculate combined area of multiple scars

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim scars from surgeries I had after service?
Only if the surgery was to treat a service-connected condition. The surgical scar becomes part of the service-connected disability.

### Are keloid scars rated differently?
Keloids may be rated under DC 7800-7805 based on their characteristics (size, pain, etc.). Significant keloids may also qualify as disfigurement.

### Can I get multiple ratings for one scar?
Yes, if the scar qualifies under multiple diagnostic codes. For example, a large, painful scar could receive ratings for both size (DC 7801) and pain (DC 7804).

### Do I need photos for my claim?
While not required, photos with measurements significantly strengthen your claim and help ensure accurate rating.

### What if my scars are in embarrassing locations?
All scars should be examined and rated. The examiner is a medical professional. Scars in private areas are still ratable.

### Can scars be rated along with the underlying injury?
Yes. You can receive separate ratings for the scar AND the underlying condition (e.g., a knee injury rating AND a separate rating for surgical scars).

### What if my scars have faded?
Faded scars can still be rated if they cause pain, are unstable, or limit function. Appearance alone doesn't determine rating.
