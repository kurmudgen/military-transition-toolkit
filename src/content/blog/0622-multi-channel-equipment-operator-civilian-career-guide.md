## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest. There are civilian skills you don't have. Recognizing the gap is the first step.

**Enterprise networking technologies:** You understand tactical network systems. Civilian work uses enterprise equipment—Cisco, Juniper, Arista routers and switches. Concepts are similar but platforms differ. Solution: Cisco CCNA covers this. Study hard, get hands-on lab time.

**IT service management:** Military operations are mission-focused. Civilian IT uses ITIL framework—incident management, change management, service levels. Solution: ITIL Foundation cert ($300-$400) covers this. Essential for NOC/support work.

**Cloud platforms:** You worked with on-premise tactical gear. Civilian IT increasingly uses cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). You need basic familiarity. Solution: Take free AWS or Azure fundamentals courses. Get entry-level cloud cert.

**Ticketing and documentation systems:** Military uses different systems than civilian IT (ServiceNow, Jira, Remedy). You'll learn on the job, but understand you'll be documenting everything in ticketing systems.

**Customer service communication:** Military operations are direct and mission-focused. Civilian IT requires softer communication—explaining technical issues to non-technical users, managing expectations, professional correspondence. Practice translating technical problems into plain language.

**Less structured environment:** Military has clear procedures and chain of command. Civilian IT has more ambiguity, competing priorities, and politics. You'll need to be more adaptable and politically aware.
