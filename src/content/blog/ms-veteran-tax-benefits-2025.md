# Mississippi Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Mississippi offers exceptional benefits for veterans, including one of the most generous property tax exemptions in the nation for 100% disabled veterans combined with the absolute lowest cost of living in America. Understanding these benefits can save you thousands annually while living in the most affordable state.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Mississippi offers veterans:

- **Property tax exemption**: 100% disabled veterans pay ZERO property taxes on homestead (full exemption)
- **Military retirement pay**: 100% exempt from state income tax
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Age-based exemption NEW**: Veterans 90+ years old get 100% property tax exemption
- **Hunting/fishing license**: FREE for 100% disabled veterans
- **Vehicle registration**: $1 license plates for 70%+ disabled veterans (exempt from all ad valorem taxes)

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $2,000-3,500+ depending on property value and location.

**The reality**: Mississippi has one of the BEST property tax benefits in the nation for 100% disabled veterans (complete elimination of property taxes) combined with the lowest cost of living in America (21% below national average). For 100% disabled veterans, Mississippi is financially unbeatable.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Fully Exempt

Mississippi does not tax military retirement pay. This exemption applies to all military retirees regardless of age, income level, or disability status.

**What this means**:
- Retire with $30,000/year military pension? Keep all of it
- Retire with $60,000/year? Still keep every penny
- No age restrictions, no income limits, no phase-outs
- No disability rating required for this benefit

**How to claim**: Mississippi does not tax military retirement income, so it's automatically excluded when you file your Mississippi state tax return. Military retirement is not reported as taxable income on your Mississippi return.

Mississippi joins 25 states that have eliminated state income tax on military retirement, making it highly competitive for all military retirees.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $165/month for a 10% rating or $3,800+/month for 100% with dependents, you won't pay taxes on it.

This includes:
- Monthly VA disability compensation
- Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)
- Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) for survivors

### Social Security Benefits - Tax-Free

Mississippi does not tax Social Security benefits. This applies to all Social Security income including retirement benefits, disability benefits (SSDI), and survivor benefits.

This means veterans receiving both military retirement and Social Security benefits pay zero state taxes on either income source.

### Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)

SBP payments are exempt from Mississippi state income tax as military retirement benefits. Surviving spouses receiving military survivor benefits won't pay Mississippi state taxes on those payments.

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Mississippi has one of the simplest state income tax structures in the nation:

**2025 Mississippi Income Tax Rates**:
- First $10,000 (single) / $20,000 (married): **0%**
- Above $10,000 (single) / $20,000 (married): **4.4%**

Mississippi recently simplified from multiple brackets to just two rates, with plans to further reduce and eventually eliminate the income tax entirely by 2040.

**Note**: These rates only apply to income that isn't already exempt (like W-2 wages, business income, non-military pensions). Military retirement, VA disability, and Social Security are all completely exempt.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100% Disabled) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Mississippi** | 100% exempt | 0-4.4% | 100% exemption |
| Alabama | 100% exempt | 2-5% | 100% exemption |
| Louisiana | 100% exempt | 1.85-4.25% | $150K assessment freeze |
| Tennessee | 100% exempt | 0% (no income tax) | Partial exemption |
| Arkansas | Up to $6,000 exempt | 2-4.4% | Varies by county |

Mississippi's combination of zero tax on military retirement, lowest cost of living in the nation, and 100% property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans makes it the most financially attractive state for fully disabled veterans.

## Property Tax Exemption for Disabled Veterans

### Reality Check: Mississippi's Property Tax Exemption is Exceptional

Mississippi offers one of the **best property tax benefits in the entire nation** for 100% disabled veterans:

**100% Disabled Veterans**: Complete exemption from all ad valorem property taxes on homestead property (you pay ZERO property taxes).

**New in 2025: Age-Based Exemption**: Veterans 90 years or older by January 1, 2025, receive 100% property tax exemption on homestead property regardless of disability rating.

### Full Property Tax Exemption for 100% Disabled Veterans

**Eligibility Requirements**:
- Honorably discharged from U.S. Armed Forces
- Service-connected total disability rating (100%) from the VA
- Own and occupy homestead property in Mississippi

**Benefit**: Complete exemption from all ad valorem taxes on the assessed value of your homestead property. You pay **ZERO** property taxes.

**No income limits**: Unlike some states, Mississippi does not impose income restrictions on this benefit.

**No property value cap**: Unlike states that cap exemptions at specific dollar amounts, Mississippi's exemption applies to the full assessed value regardless of home price.

### Surviving Spouse Eligibility

Un-remarried surviving spouses of 100% disabled veterans can continue to receive the full property tax exemption if:

- The veteran had a service-connected total disability rating
- The spouse does not remarry
- The spouse continues to own and occupy the homestead property

This is critical - Mississippi allows surviving spouses to maintain this valuable benefit for life as long as they don't remarry.

### Real-World Examples: Property Tax Savings

**Mississippi advantage: $71,400 over 20 years** - primarily due to 100% property tax exemption.

## Cost of Living Advantage

Mississippi's biggest veteran benefit is often the most important: **the absolute lowest cost of living in America**.

### Cost of Living Comparison (100 = National Average)

- **Mississippi overall**: 83.3 (21.3% below national average) - **LOWEST IN NATION**
- Housing: 26% below national average
- Groceries: 4% below national average
- Utilities: 11% below national average
- Healthcare: 8% below national average
- Transportation: 8% below national average

**Real-world impact**:
- National median home price: $419,000
- Mississippi median home price: $251,100 (**40% lower**)
- Jackson median home price: $121,000 (exceptionally affordable)
- Average Mississippi rent: $988/month (vs. $1,639 national average)

**Combined effect**: Lowest housing costs in America + 100% property tax exemption for disabled veterans + zero tax on military retirement = exceptional purchasing power.

## Other Financial Benefits

### Sales Tax

Mississippi does not offer sales tax exemptions for veterans on general purchases. The state sales tax rate is **7%** (some local jurisdictions may add additional taxes).

While this is higher than some states, the overall cost of living savings more than compensate.

### Mississippi State Income Tax Reduction Plan

Mississippi passed legislation to progressively reduce income taxes:
- 2025: 4.4% top rate on income over $10,000
- By 2030: Planned reduction to 3%
- By 2040: Goal of complete elimination

This benefits veterans with non-exempt income (employment, business, non-military pensions).

### Unemployment Benefits for Veterans

**Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX)**: Available if you separated from active duty in the last 18 months

**Who qualifies**: Honorably discharged veterans recently separated from active duty

**How much**: Based on military pay

**Duration**: Up to 26 weeks in Mississippi

**Contact**: Mississippi Department of Employment Security

## How to Maximize Your Benefits

### Step 1: Property Tax Exemption (Most Critical for 100% Disabled)

**Timeline**: Apply by April 1st annually (check with your county)

**Where to apply**: Your county tax assessor's office

**Pro tip**: Apply as soon as you receive your 100% disability rating. Contact your county assessor immediately to ensure you don't miss the deadline for the current tax year.

**Required documents**:
- VA rating letter (100% service-connected)
- DD-214 (honorable discharge)

### Step 2: Update State Tax Withholding

If you're receiving military retirement pay, ensure your state tax withholding is set to zero for Mississippi or claim the exemption when filing.

Mississippi does not tax military retirement, so it's automatically excluded. Do not report military retirement as taxable income on your Mississippi return.

### Step 3: Vehicle Registration Benefits (70%+ Disabled)

**Timeline**: Apply when registering or renewing vehicle

1. Visit your county tax collector's office
2. Bring VA rating letter (70%+ service-connected disability)
3. Bring DD-214 (honorable discharge)
4. For non-permanent disabilities, bring updated VA benefits letter at renewal
5. Pay $1 per plate for up to two vehicles

**Savings**: Hundreds per vehicle per year from ad valorem tax exemption

### Step 4: Hunting/Fishing License (100% Disabled)

**Timeline**: One-time setup, ongoing benefit

1. Obtain proof of 100% VA disability rating
2. Carry documentation while hunting/fishing, OR
3. Purchase $5 Disabled Exempt License for convenience

### Step 5: Track Your Savings

Keep records of benefits claimed:
- Annual property tax exemption (save $0 tax bills showing exemption)
- State tax returns showing military retirement exclusion
- Vehicle registration receipts showing disabled veteran exemption
- Total savings documentation

This helps you understand the real value of your benefits and ensures proper application each year.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?

Check with your county tax assessor. Some counties require annual verification while others maintain your exemption once approved. It's best to contact your assessor before the April 1 deadline each year to confirm.

### What if I'm rated 70% disabled?

You qualify for the $1 disabled veteran license plates (exempt from ad valorem taxes on vehicles). However, you do NOT qualify for the 100% property tax exemption on your home unless you also meet the age requirement (90+ years old).

### Can I get the property tax exemption on a second home or rental property?

No. The exemption applies only to your homestead property where you live as your primary residence. You cannot claim it on investment properties, vacation homes, or rental properties.

### What if I move to a different county in Mississippi?

You continue to qualify for the exemption. File with your new county tax assessor's office with the same documentation (VA rating letter, DD-214, proof of homestead).

### Does the property tax exemption apply to condos?

Yes. Condo owners can claim the 100% property tax exemption if they meet the eligibility requirements (100% service-connected disability or age 90+).

### What happens if I sell my home?

The exemption ends when you sell. When you purchase a new home in Mississippi, apply for the exemption with your new county tax assessor using the same documentation.

### Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption?

Yes, if your spouse:
- Does not remarry
- Continues to own and occupy the same primary residence
- The veteran had a 100% service-connected disability

Your spouse should contact the county tax assessor to update the exemption after your death.

### Will military retirement pay be taxed if I earned it in another state?

No. As long as you're a Mississippi resident when you receive the retirement pay, it's exempt from Mississippi state income tax regardless of where you served.

### What if I'm 90 years old but don't have a disability rating?

You still qualify for the 100% property tax exemption based on age alone. Apply with your county tax assessor by April 1st with proof of honorable discharge and proof of age (birth certificate, driver's license, etc.).

### Does Mississippi tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, at Mississippi income tax rates (0% on first $10K single/$20K married, then 4.4% above that). Qualified retirement account withdrawals are treated as regular income. However, military retirement pay specifically is exempt.

### What if my county denies my exemption claim?

You have the right to appeal:

1. Request explanation from county tax assessor
2. Provide additional documentation if needed
3. Contact Mississippi State Veterans Affairs Board for assistance: 1-866-632-8182
4. File formal protest if necessary

### Can I claim the vehicle exemption on more than two vehicles?

You can purchase the $1 disabled veteran license plate for up to two motor vehicles OR one motorcycle. Additional vehicles must pay regular registration fees and ad valorem taxes.
