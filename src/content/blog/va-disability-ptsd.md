## Understanding PTSD VA Ratings

PTSD is rated under 38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. The VA evaluates PTSD based on the frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms and their impact on occupational and social functioning.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 0% Rating
**Criteria:** A mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Diagnosed PTSD but minimal symptoms
- No medication needed or only occasional use
- Full-time employment maintained
- Social relationships intact
- No significant functional impairment

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Mild anxiety or depression
- Occasional difficulty concentrating
- Minor sleep disturbance
- Symptoms worsen under stress but generally manageable
- Medication helps control symptoms
- Can maintain employment with some difficulty during stressful periods

#### 30% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).

**What This Looks Like:**
- Noticeable symptoms affecting work performance
- Depressed mood or anxiety present regularly
- Panic attacks occur weekly or less
- Sleep problems are chronic
- Mild memory issues
- Can work but with decreased efficiency
- Social life somewhat affected
- Self-care generally maintained

#### 50% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Significant work performance issues
- Frequent panic attacks (more than weekly)
- Memory problems affecting daily tasks
- Difficulty maintaining relationships
- Reduced reliability at work
- May miss work frequently
- Social isolation beginning
- Emotional numbness or inappropriate affect
- Difficulty following complex instructions

#### 70% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Unable to maintain employment or only able to work with significant accommodations
- Deficiencies in most areas of life
- Severe depression or near-constant panic
- Suicidal thoughts (with or without plan)
- Cannot maintain relationships effectively
- May have violent outbursts

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Current Diagnosis
You need a formal PTSD diagnosis from a qualified mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker). The diagnosis must be documented in medical records.

**Best Practices:**
- Seek treatment from VA mental health services or private providers
- Ensure diagnosis is clearly stated in records
- Get ongoing treatment to document symptom progression
- Request DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire) completion

### 2. In-Service Stressor
You must establish that a stressful event occurred during service. The type of stressor affects evidence requirements:

**Combat Stressor:**
- If you engaged in combat, your testimony alone may be sufficient
- Combat can be verified through service records, medals, or unit history
- Easier standard of proof than non-combat stressors

**Military Sexual Trauma (MST):**
- Your testimony is crucial
- Markers of MST in service records help (medical visits, behavior changes, requests for transfer)
- Secondary evidence (friend/family statements, contemporaneous journals)
- VA provides special consideration for MST claims

**Personal Assault:**
- Similar to MST in evidence requirements
- Behavioral markers in service records
- Lay statements from people who knew you during/after service

**Non-Combat Stressor:**
- Must provide more detailed corroboration
- Service records, buddy statements, unit histories
- Morning reports, duty logs, etc.

**Fear of Hostile Military or Terrorist Activity:**
- Must be consistent with circumstances of service
- Does not need corroboration if consistent with places, types, and circumstances of service

### 3. Nexus (Link) to Service
A medical professional must provide an opinion that your PTSD is "at least as likely as not" (50% or greater probability) related to your military service.

**Best Practices:**
- Ask your treating provider for a nexus letter
- Provide your provider with service records and stressor information
- Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) if VA denies
- Nexus letters should be detailed and reference specific events and symptoms

### 4. Functional Impact Documentation
This is critical for higher ratings. Document how PTSD affects your daily life:

**Employment Records:**
- Performance reviews showing decline
- Attendance records
- Disciplinary actions
- Termination notices
- Inability to maintain employment

**Medical Treatment Records:**
- Frequency of appointments
- Medications prescribed
- Hospitalizations or ER visits
- Crisis interventions
- Therapy notes showing symptom severity

**Personal Statements:**
- Daily routine description
- Specific examples of how PTSD affects you
- Work difficulties
- Relationship problems
- Social isolation
- Self-care issues

**Lay Statements from Family/Friends:**
- Before and after service observations
- Specific behavioral changes
- Impact on relationships
- Daily life limitations they've witnessed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability for PTSD if I never saw combat?
Yes. PTSD can result from any traumatic event during service, including MST, personal assault, accidents, training incidents, witnessing death/injury, or even fear of hostile military activity. The key is establishing that a traumatic stressor occurred during service.

### Do I need to have filed a report of MST or assault to get PTSD benefits?
No. The VA recognizes that many assaults go unreported. You can establish MST or assault through behavioral markers in your service records, lay statements, and your own credible testimony.

### How long does a PTSD claim take?
Average processing time is 130-180 days for initial claims, but complex cases can take longer. Appeals can take 1-3 years depending on the appeal path chosen.

### Can I work and still receive PTSD disability?
Yes. You can work and receive VA disability unless you're claiming unemployability (TDIU). However, your ability to work may affect your rating level, as severe ratings require significant occupational impairment.

### Will my PTSD rating be reduced?
Ratings can be reduced if VA determines your condition has improved. However, PTSD ratings are often protected after 20 years or if the veteran is over 55. Continue treatment and document ongoing symptoms.

### Can I get 100% for PTSD alone?
Yes. If your PTSD symptoms meet the 100% criteria (total occupational and social impairment), you can receive a 100% rating for PTSD alone.

### What if my PTSD has gotten worse?
File for an increase. Wait until you have at least 6 months of medical evidence showing worsening symptoms, then file VA Form 21-526EZ requesting an increase.

### Do I need a VA doctor or can I use private doctors?
Both are acceptable. Private medical evidence is given equal weight to VA medical evidence. Many veterans successfully claim using only private doctor records.

### What if my stressor is classified?
You can still file. Provide as much detail as possible without revealing classified information. The VA has access to classified records and can verify your stressor through other means.

### Can I get PTSD disability if I was discharged dishonorably?
Possibly. Dishonorable discharges generally bar VA benefits, but if you can prove your misconduct was caused by undiagnosed PTSD, you may qualify for a discharge upgrade or character of discharge determination allowing benefits.

### Should I hire a VA attorney or claims agent?
For initial claims, many veterans successfully file on their own or with help from VSOs (free). For appeals, especially complicated cases, an accredited attorney may be worthwhile. They work on contingency (typically 20-33% of back pay) and are only paid if you win.

### Will my PTSD affect my security clearance?
Getting treatment and filing for VA disability should not automatically affect a security clearance. Mental health treatment is increasingly viewed as responsible behavior. However, severe untreated symptoms could be a security concern.

### Can I get PTSD benefits if I'm Guard/Reserve?
Yes. If your PTSD resulted from active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, you may be eligible. Deployment-related PTSD is common among Guard/Reserve members.

### What if VA says my stressor didn't happen?
Appeal with additional evidence. Get buddy statements, unit histories, morning reports, or other documentation. Consider hiring a private researcher who specializes in military records. For combat and MST claims, remember the burden of proof is lower.

### Does marijuana use affect my PTSD claim?
Be honest about marijuana use with your providers. Some veterans use it to manage PTSD symptoms. While the VA won't pay for medical marijuana, they won't deny claims solely based on use. However, substance abuse issues must be addressed.

## Final Thoughts

PTSD is one of the most common and significant service-connected disabilities. If you're suffering from PTSD related to your military service, you deserve compensation and treatment. The key to a successful claim is:

1. **Get treatment** - Both for your health and to document your condition
2. **Be thorough** - Gather all evidence before filing
3. **Be honest** - Don't minimize or exaggerate symptoms
4. **Be persistent** - Don't give up if initially denied
5. **Get help** - Use VSOs, attorneys, or accredited agents when needed

Remember: You earned these benefits through your service. There is no shame in claiming PTSD disability. Take care of yourself, document your condition, and file your claim.

**You are not alone. Help is available. You deserve support.**
