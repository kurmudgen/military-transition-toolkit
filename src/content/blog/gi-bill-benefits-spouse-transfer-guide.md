# Using Spouse GI Bill Benefits: Chapter 35 & Transfer Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Military spouses can access GI Bill education benefits through two main paths: **Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer** (if your service member transfers months to you) or **Chapter 35 DEA** (if your spouse is rated permanently disabled or died in service). Post-9/11 transfer provides **full tuition + housing allowance + book stipend**—potentially $100,000+ in education funding. Chapter 35 DEA provides a **monthly stipend** (~$1,400/month) for education expenses. Understanding which benefit you qualify for and how to maximize it can fund your entire degree.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Education costs are a barrier to career advancement. GI Bill benefits remove that barrier:

**Post-9/11 GI Bill Transfer:**
- Full tuition at public schools (or private with Yellow Ribbon)
- Monthly housing allowance (BAH rate)
- Book stipend
- Can fund bachelor's, master's, or professional degrees

**Chapter 35 DEA:**
- Monthly payment for education expenses
- Available to spouses of certain disabled or deceased veterans
- Less comprehensive but still valuable

Either benefit can transform your career prospects by making education affordable.

## Post-9/11 GI Bill Transfer

### What It Provides

| Benefit | What You Get |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tuition** | Full in-state tuition at public schools, or Yellow Ribbon + VA cap at private |
| **Housing (BAH)** | Monthly housing allowance based on school's ZIP code (must be more than half-time) |
| **Book Stipend** | Up to ~$1,000/year |
| **Duration** | 36 months (or however many months transferred) |

**Example Annual Value:**
- Tuition: $12,000 (state school)
- Housing: $24,000 ($2,000/month × 12)
- Books: $1,000
- **Total: $37,000/year**

### Eligibility for Transfer

**Service Member Requirements:**
- 6+ years of service at time of transfer
- Agree to serve 4 additional years (or be retirement eligible)
- Approved by branch of service
- Must initiate transfer while still serving

**Spouse Recipient Requirements:**
- Legal spouse at time of transfer
- Transfer approved by DoD
- Valid for 15 years from last active duty date (or until divorced)

### How Transfer Works

**Step 1: Service Member Initiates**
- Service member logs into milConnect
- Requests transfer of months to spouse
- Specifies number of months (can be any portion)

**Step 2: Branch Approves**
- Each branch processes differently
- Typical approval: 2-4 weeks
- Service commitment begins upon approval

**Step 3: Spouse Uses Benefit**
- Apply for Certificate of Eligibility (COE) at va.gov/education
- Submit to school's VA certifying official
- Enroll in courses
- VA pays school directly for tuition
- Housing allowance paid to you monthly

### Transfer Timing and Strategies

**When to Transfer:**
- Before spouse reaches retirement eligibility (after = lost opportunity)
- While service member can commit to 4 additional years
- Before separation (cannot transfer after separation)

**Strategic Decisions:**
- Transfer all 36 months or split among family members
- Spouse uses while service member is active = housing allowance available
- Can transfer months between children/spouse later (with some restrictions)

### Common Transfer Mistakes

**Waiting Too Long:**
- Must transfer while still serving
- Cannot transfer after separation/retirement
- Branches have specific windows

**Not Understanding 4-Year Commitment:**
- Transfer requires 4 additional years
- Early separation = potential recoupment
- Retirement-eligible members exempt

**Divorce Impacts:**
- Divorce before use = spouse loses benefit
- Service member can transfer to new spouse/children
- Plan accordingly

## Chapter 35: Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA)

### What It Provides

- **Monthly Stipend:** ~$1,400/month (2024 rate, adjusts annually)
- **Duration:** Up to 36 months
- **Covers:** Degree programs, vocational training, certification programs
- **No Tuition Payment:** Stipend covers expenses you allocate

### Eligibility

**You May Qualify If Your Spouse:**
- Died in service or from service-connected condition
- Is rated permanently and totally disabled (P&T)
- Died with permanent total disability rating
- Is MIA or POW for 90+ days

**Key Notes:**
- "Permanent and total" (P&T) is specific VA rating
- 100% schedular may not include P&T
- Check your spouse's rating letter carefully
- Can use up to 20 years after spouse's death or disability rating

### How to Apply

1. **Verify Eligibility**
   - Confirm spouse's disability rating includes "permanent and total"
   - Or confirm death was service-connected

2. **Apply Online**
   - Use VA Form 22-5490 (Application for Survivors and Dependents' Educational Assistance)
   - Submit at va.gov/education

3. **Certificate of Eligibility**
   - VA issues COE upon approval
   - Submit to school's certifying official

4. **Receive Benefits**
   - Enroll in approved program
   - VA sends monthly stipend directly to you

### Chapter 35 vs. Post-9/11 Comparison

| Factor | Post-9/11 GI Bill (Transfer) | Chapter 35 DEA |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------|
| **Tuition Coverage** | Full (public) or capped (private) | No direct tuition payment |
| **Monthly Payment** | Housing allowance (~$1,500-$3,000) | Fixed stipend (~$1,400) |
| **Book Stipend** | Yes (~$1,000/year) | No |
| **Best For** | Full-time degree at quality school | Part-time study, cheaper programs |
| **Eligibility** | Service member must transfer | Spouse disability or death |

**If You Qualify for Both:**
Generally, Post-9/11 Transfer provides more total value. However, you cannot use both simultaneously. Consult VA education counselor for your specific situation.

## Maximizing Your Benefits

### School Selection Strategy

**For Post-9/11 Transfer:**
- Public schools: Full tuition covered
- Private schools: VA cap + Yellow Ribbon may cover difference
- Online schools: Many participate in Yellow Ribbon

**Yellow Ribbon Program:**
- School and VA split costs above cap
- Check if school participates: va.gov/education
- Can make expensive private schools affordable

### Enrollment Status Matters

**Housing Allowance (Post-9/11):**
- Full-time: Full BAH rate
- 3/4 time: 75% of BAH
- 1/2 time: 50% of BAH
- Less than half-time: No housing allowance
- Online-only: 50% of national average rate

**Strategy:** Enroll at least half-time to receive housing allowance

### Timing Your Studies

**During Active Service:**
- Spouse can use benefit while service member is active
- Housing allowance is valuable addition

**After Separation:**
- Benefit expires 15 years after service member's last active duty date
- Plan to complete education within timeframe

**OCONUS:**
- GI Bill works for schools overseas
- Housing allowance based on school location
- Many online programs qualify

### Combining with Other Aid

**You CAN Combine:**
- Pell Grant
- State grants
- Private scholarships
- Work-study

**You CANNOT Combine (same time):**
- Post-9/11 GI Bill and Chapter 35
- Multiple VA education benefits simultaneously

## Common Questions

**Q: My spouse hasn't transferred months yet. What should I do?**
A: Talk to your spouse immediately. Transfer must happen while they're still serving. The 4-year commitment may be a concern—discuss it together.

**Q: Can I use transferred GI Bill for a second bachelor's or master's?**
A: Yes. GI Bill covers undergraduate and graduate education, as well as vocational training.

**Q: What if I'm divorced after transfer but before using the benefit?**
A: Divorce typically ends spouse eligibility. Service member can transfer those months to children or new spouse.

**Q: My spouse is rated 100% but I'm not sure about "permanent." How do I check?**
A: Look at VA rating decision letter. It should specifically say "permanent" or "not expected to improve." If unclear, contact VA.

**Q: Can I use GI Bill for online school?**
A: Yes. Housing allowance for online-only is 50% of national average rate. If you take even one in-person class, housing is based on school location.

**Q: What about certificate programs?**
A: GI Bill can cover approved certificate and vocational programs, not just degrees. Check VA's approval list.
