**Your HM Experience Value**

As an HM, you've done professional medical work. Emergency care, patient assessment, medication administration, wound care, basic and advanced life support. If you're 8404 FMF, you've done combat medicine. If you're hospital-based, you've worked in specific departments - surgical tech, radiology, pharmacy, lab.

This translates directly to civilian EMS, nursing, surgical tech, and allied health careers. Employers value your hands-on experience, ability to work under pressure, and medical knowledge base.

**Career Pathways**

**EMT/Paramedic Path:**
Similar to 68W (Episode 8), but HMs often have broader medical experience. EMT median $41K, Paramedic $58K, Flight Paramedic $70K-$90K. Many HMs already have EMT from A-school. Need to maintain NREMT certification. Paramedic programs 12-24 months, some offer HM bridge programs.

**Registered Nurse:**
Highest earning healthcare path. RN median $93,600. Your HM experience gives massive advantage in nursing school. ADN (2 years) or BSN (4 years) using GI Bill. Pass NCLEX exam. Travel nurses make $100K-$150K+. Critical care, ER, surgical nursing all open to you.

**Surgical Technologist:**
If you were operating room HM, natural fit. Median $60K. Requires certification program (9-24 months), often covered by GI Bill. Work directly in surgeries assisting surgeons.

**Radiologic Technologist:**
If you have radiology experience. Median $73K. Requires associate's degree and certification. Growing field with good job security.

**Physician Assistant:**
Advanced practice. Median $130K-$150K+. Requires Master's degree (2-3 years). Your HM experience counts toward clinical hours required for PA school admission. Highly competitive but achievable.

**Nurse Practitioner:**
After RN, pursue Master's for NP. Median $120K-$140K+. Prescribing authority, high autonomy. 2-3 years post-BSN.

**VA Healthcare:**
VA hospitals actively recruit veteran HMs. RN positions, surgical tech, various allied health roles. Veteran preference in hiring, familiar environment.

**Companies/Organizations:**
- All major hospital systems (HCA, Ascension, Mayo Clinic)
- AMR and private ambulance companies for EMT/Paramedic
- Travel nursing companies (AMN Healthcare, Aya)
- VA hospitals nationwide
- Military hospitals as civilian staff

**Certifications and Education**

**Maintain NREMT:** Keep your EMT cert active. Costs $100-$300 for refresher.

**Paramedic:** Find HM bridge programs that recognize military training. 6-12 months instead of 18-24.

**Nursing School:** Use GI Bill. ADN if you need to work sooner, BSN for best career options. Accelerated BSN if you have prior bachelor's degree (12-18 months).

**Specialty Certs:** Once working, pursue certifications like CEN (Emergency Nursing), CCRN (Critical Care), based on specialty.

**GI Bill Strategy:** For RN path, full-time BSN using Post-9/11 GI Bill provides tuition plus $2,355/month housing allowance. Total value $100K+ for degree leading to $90K+ career.

**Timeline**

12 months out: Decide path (EMT/Paramedic fast, RN higher paying). Maintain NREMT. Research nursing programs or paramedic programs.

6-9 months out: Apply to nursing/paramedic school. Update resume translating HM experience. Network with healthcare professionals.

3-6 months out: If going RN, start school or apply for admission. If paramedic, enroll in program. SkillBridge with hospitals or EMS services if available.

Post-separation: Complete education, pass licensing exams, start civilian healthcare career.

**Key Points**
- HM experience highly valued in civilian healthcare
- EMT/Paramedic: $41K-$90K, faster path (1-2 years)
- RN: $93K median, best long-term earning (2-4 years education)
- PA/NP: $120K-$150K+, requires advanced degrees
