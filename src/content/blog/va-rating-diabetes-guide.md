# VA Rating for Diabetes: Type 2 Compensation Guide (2025)

Type 2 diabetes affects millions of veterans, and for many, it's connected to military service—especially Agent Orange exposure. VA ratings for diabetes range from 10% to 100%, and the secondary conditions (neuropathy, ED, kidney disease) can push your combined rating significantly higher.

This guide covers everything you need to maximize your diabetes claim.

## How the VA Rates Diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is rated under Diagnostic Code 7913 based on how much management your condition requires.

### Diabetes Rating Criteria

| Rating | Monthly Pay (2025) | Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **10%** | $175.51 | Manageable by restricted diet only |
| **20%** | $357.03 | Requires insulin and restricted diet, OR oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet |
| **40%** | $755.28 | Requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities |
| **60%** | $1,110.55 | Requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or twice monthly visits to diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated |
| **100%** | $3,906.04 | Requires more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities (avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities) with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least 3 hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength OR complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated |

### Understanding the Criteria

**10% - Diet Only**
- No medication required
- Controlled through dietary changes
- Rare—most diabetics need medication

**20% - Most Common Rating**
- Takes insulin OR oral medication
- Follows restricted diet
- This is where most veterans land

**40% - Requires Activity Regulation**
- Takes insulin
- Follows restricted diet
- **Must regulate activities** (this is the key)
- Doctor has told you to avoid certain physical activities due to diabetes

**60% - Hospitalizations or Complications**
- All 40% criteria plus
- 1-2 hospitalizations/year for ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia
- OR twice monthly diabetic care visits
- Plus non-compensable complications

**100% - Severe Diabetes**
- Multiple daily insulin injections
- Restricted diet and regulated activities
- 3+ hospitalizations/year or weekly provider visits
- Progressive weight/strength loss OR compensable complications

### The "Regulation of Activities" Requirement

The jump from 20% to 40% requires documented "regulation of activities"—meaning a medical professional has restricted your physical activity due to diabetes.

**What qualifies:**
- Doctor note stating you must avoid strenuous activity
- Restrictions on occupational duties
- Limitations on recreational activities
- Documentation in treatment records

**What doesn't qualify:**
- Self-imposed restrictions
- General advice to "take it easy"
- Exercise recommendations (exercise is actually encouraged for diabetes)

**How to get this documented:**
Ask your doctor: "Have my diabetes complications or blood sugar control issues required you to restrict my physical activities?" If yes, get it in writing.

## Agent Orange Presumptive Connection

**This is huge**: Type 2 diabetes is presumptively service-connected for veterans with Agent Orange exposure.

### Who Qualifies

If you served in these locations during these dates:

**Vietnam** (January 9, 1962 – May 7, 1975)
- Boots on ground
- Brown water Navy (inland waterways)
- Blue water Navy (if entered inland waters or went ashore)
- Aircrews flying over Vietnam

**Korean DMZ** (September 1, 1967 – August 31, 1971)

**Thailand** (February 28, 1961 – May 7, 1975)
- U-Tapao
- Ubon
- Nakhon Phanom
- Udorn
- Takhli
- Korat
- Don Muang

**Other locations** where Agent Orange was tested or used

### What Presumptive Means

If you have qualifying service + Type 2 diabetes diagnosis:
- No nexus letter required
- No need to prove causation
- VA assumes service caused your diabetes

**Filing is straightforward:**
1. Submit claim for diabetes
2. VA verifies your qualifying service
3. VA confirms diabetes diagnosis
4. Service connection granted

## Non-Agent Orange Service Connection

If you don't qualify for Agent Orange presumptive, you can still claim diabetes through other paths.

### Direct Service Connection

To prove diabetes is directly connected to service:

**Evidence needed:**
1. Current diagnosis of diabetes
2. In-service evidence of blood sugar issues
3. Nexus opinion

**In-service evidence might include:**
- Elevated blood sugar readings during physicals
- Pre-diabetic diagnosis during service
- Treatment for blood sugar issues
- Family history combined with service stressors

### Secondary Service Connection

Diabetes can be secondary to other conditions:

**PTSD/Anxiety → Diabetes**
- Chronic stress affects blood sugar regulation
- Cortisol increases insulin resistance
- Some psychiatric medications cause weight gain and diabetes

**Obesity from Service-Connected Conditions → Diabetes**
- Can't exercise due to orthopedic injuries
- Weight gain increases diabetes risk

**Medications → Diabetes**
- Some steroids and psychiatric medications cause diabetes
- Document medication history

### Diabetes Secondary TO Other Conditions

Less common, but diabetes can develop secondary to:
- Pancreatitis
- Cushing's syndrome
- Certain medications for service-connected conditions

## Secondary Conditions FROM Diabetes

This is where diabetes claims become extremely valuable. Diabetes causes numerous complications, each ratable separately.

### Peripheral Neuropathy (Most Common)

Diabetes damages nerves, especially in extremities.

**Rating by extremity:**

| Severity | Upper Extremity (Dominant) | Upper Extremity (Non-Dom) | Lower Extremity |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Mild | 20% | 20% | 10% |
| Moderate | 40% | 30% | 20% |
| Severe | 50% | 40% | 30% |

**You can be rated for all four extremities** if neuropathy affects all of them.

**Example**: Veteran with diabetes + mild neuropathy in all four extremities:
- Diabetes: 20%
- Right hand: 20%
- Left hand: 20%
- Right foot: 10%
- Left foot: 10%
- **Combined: 58%**

### Erectile Dysfunction

Very common with diabetes.
- Rated 0% for ED itself
- **BUT qualifies for Special Monthly Compensation K (SMC-K)**
- SMC-K adds $131.64/month to any rating
- File it—free money

### Diabetic Retinopathy (Vision Problems)

Diabetes damages blood vessels in eyes.
- Rated under eye diagnostic codes
- Can range from 10% to blindness ratings
- Get regular eye exams and document any diabetic changes

### Nephropathy (Kidney Disease)

Diabetes is leading cause of kidney disease.
- Rated under renal diagnostic codes
- Monitor kidney function labs (eGFR, creatinine)
- Can be rated 0-100% depending on severity

### Hypertension

Often develops alongside diabetes.
- Rated 10-60%
- Easy secondary claim if you have both

### Skin Conditions

Diabetes causes various skin problems.
- Diabetic dermopathy
- Increased infection risk
- May be separately ratable

### Cardiovascular Disease

Diabetes dramatically increases heart disease risk.
- Heart conditions rated under cardiac codes
- Can be high-value secondary claims

## C&P Exam for Diabetes

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about diabetes history and management
3. Check for complications
4. Review medication and treatment regimen
5. Document activity restrictions (if any)
6. Provide nexus opinion (for non-presumptive claims)

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- When were you diagnosed with diabetes?
- What medications do you take?
- How often do you check blood sugar?
- What's your diet like?
- Have you been hospitalized for diabetes emergencies?
- Have you been told to restrict your activities?
- What complications do you have?
- Do you have numbness or tingling in extremities?
- Any vision problems?
- Any sexual dysfunction?

### How to Respond

**Document all complications:**
- "I have numbness in my feet"
- "I've noticed vision changes"
- "I have erectile dysfunction"
- "My kidney function has declined"

**Activity restrictions:**
If your doctor has restricted your activities, make sure to mention it. Bring documentation.

**Emphasize management burden:**
- How often you check blood sugar
- How often you see your doctor
- Medication changes you've had
- Any hospitalizations or ER visits

### What to Bring

- List of all diabetes medications (with dosages)
- Blood sugar logs if you keep them
- Recent A1C results
- Documentation of any activity restrictions
- List of all complications

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Current diabetes diagnosis** (Type 2)
2. **Treatment records** showing ongoing management
3. **Lab results** (A1C, fasting glucose, kidney function)
4. **Medication history**
5. **Documentation of complications**
6. **Activity restriction documentation** (if applicable)

### For Agent Orange Claims

7. **DD-214** showing qualifying service
8. **Deployment records** to Vietnam, Korea DMZ, or Thailand
9. **Ship logs** (Blue Water Navy)

### For Secondary Complications

10. **Separate documentation for each complication:**
    - Neuropathy: Nerve conduction studies, neurologist notes
    - ED: Documentation of condition, treatment attempts
    - Retinopathy: Eye exam results showing diabetic changes
    - Nephropathy: Lab results showing kidney function decline

### Lay Evidence

11. **Personal statement** describing:
    - When diabetes was diagnosed
    - How service caused it (for non-AO claims)
    - Daily management burden
    - Impact on life
    - All complications experienced

12. **Buddy statements** from family members describing your diabetes management and limitations

## Common Denial Reasons and Solutions

### "No Agent Orange exposure"
**Solution**:
- Verify your service locations and dates
- Check ship deck logs (Blue Water Navy)
- Review all possible exposure pathways

### "Type 1, not Type 2"
**Solution**: Agent Orange presumptive is for Type 2 only. If you have Type 1, you'll need different service connection evidence.

### "Pre-existing condition"
**Solution**: If diabetes existed before service but was aggravated, file aggravation claim with medical evidence of worsening.

### "No evidence of activity regulation"
**Solution**: Get explicit documentation from your doctor stating activities are restricted due to diabetes.

## Maximizing Your Diabetes Compensation

### 1. File All Secondary Conditions

Diabetes alone at 20% = $357/month
Diabetes + complications = potentially $2,000+/month

File everything:
- Peripheral neuropathy (all affected extremities)
- Erectile dysfunction (SMC-K)
- Retinopathy
- Nephropathy
- Hypertension
- Heart disease

### 2. Document Activity Restrictions

Getting from 20% to 40% requires documented activity restrictions. Ask your doctor.

### 3. Get Specialized Testing

- Nerve conduction studies for neuropathy
- Regular eye exams for retinopathy
- Kidney function labs
- Cardiac workup

### 4. Keep Detailed Records

- Blood sugar logs
- A1C history
- Medication changes
- Hospitalizations or ER visits

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Type 1 diabetes presumptive for Agent Orange?
No. Only Type 2 diabetes is presumptive for Agent Orange exposure.

### Can I get 40% without insulin?
No. The 40% criteria specifically require insulin use plus activity regulation.

### What if my diabetes is well-controlled?
You're still rated based on what management your condition requires. Well-controlled on insulin + diet = 20%.

### Are complications rated separately?
Yes. Neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and other complications are rated separately and combined with your diabetes rating.

### Can I claim diabetes secondary to PTSD?
Yes. There's medical evidence linking chronic stress and PTSD to diabetes development. Get a nexus letter.

### What's the average diabetes rating?
Most veterans receive 20% for diabetes itself. However, combined with secondary conditions, total ratings often reach 60-80% or higher.

## 2025 Compensation Rates

| Rating | Veteran Alone | With Spouse | With Spouse + Child |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 10% | $175.51 | $175.51 | $175.51 |
| 20% | $357.03 | $398.03 | $436.03 |
| 40% | $755.28 | $838.28 | $897.28 |

| 100% | $3,906.04 | $4,123.77 | $4,236.77 |

Plus SMC-K ($131.64/month) if you have erectile dysfunction.

## Bottom Line

Diabetes is one of the most valuable VA disability claims because of all the secondary conditions that come with it. A veteran with diabetes + neuropathy + ED can easily reach 60%+ combined rating.

Key steps:
1. Verify Agent Orange presumptive status if applicable
2. File for diabetes at appropriate rating (20% most common)
3. File ALL secondary conditions
4. Get specialized testing for complications
5. Document activity restrictions if you have them
6. Don't forget SMC-K for ED

Your diabetes is connected to your service. Get every dollar you're entitled to.
