2. Contact local FAA FSDO and request FAA Form 8610-2 for experience evaluation
3. FSDO evaluates your experience against FAA requirements (30 months documented experience in powerplant)
4. **Challenge:** Most 6212s have strong powerplant experience but may lack documented airframe experience for unrestricted A&P
5. If approved, authorized to test for FAA exams
6. Pass written, oral, and practical exams

**Time:** 2-6 months depending on FSDO processing
**Cost:** $500-$2,000 (study materials, exams, prep course)
**Success rate:** Good for powerplant rating; may need airframe separately

**Reality check:** Your 6212 powerplant experience qualifies you for **Powerplant** rating. You may need additional airframe experience/training for **Airframe** rating to get full A&P license.

Many jobs require full A&P (both ratings), but some engine-specific positions accept Powerplant rating only.

### Option 2: FAA-approved Part 147 school (most common for 6212s)

**Process:**
- Attend FAA-certified aviation maintenance school
- Complete both Airframe and Powerplant curriculum
- Graduate eligible for FAA testing
- Pass written, oral, and practical exams

**Time:** 12-24 months depending on program
**Cost:** $15,000-$40,000 (GI Bill covers)
**Outcome:** Full A&P license (Airframe & Powerplant)

**Top schools:** Spartan College, Aviation Institute of Maintenance, Redstone College, community college programs

**Reality check:** This is the most straightforward path for most 6212s. GI Bill covers costs, you get both ratings, and you're immediately employable upon graduation.

### Option 3: Hybrid approach

**Process:**
- Get Powerplant rating through experience evaluation
- Attend abbreviated airframe program (some schools offer powerplant-holders shortened airframe programs)
- Test for Airframe rating

**Time:** 6-12 months for airframe portion
**Cost:** $8,000-$18,000 (GI Bill covers)

**Recommendation for 6212s:** If FSDO approves your powerplant experience for testing, try Option 1 for Powerplant rating. Then decide if you want to pursue Airframe through abbreviated school (Option 3) or full program (Option 2).

Most competitive positions require full A&P, so investing in complete certification is usually worth it.
