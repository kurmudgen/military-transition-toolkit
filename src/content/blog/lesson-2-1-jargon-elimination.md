### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Module 2 - Translation Techniques / Lesson 2.1 - Jargon Elimination Strategy]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to Module 2! In Module 1, you learned WHY military resumes fail and HOW to identify your transferable skills. Now we're going to get tactical.

In this lesson, I'm going to show you exactly how to eliminate military jargon from your resume and replace it with powerful civilian language. We're going to go through 100+ military terms and their civilian equivalents, organized by category.

**[ON SCREEN: "100+ Military→Civilian Translations"]**

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a complete translation guide for every piece of jargon on your resume. You'll also learn branch-specific translations and rank-appropriate language.

Let's dive in and start speaking civilian.

### PART 1: FUNDAMENTAL TRANSLATIONS (0:30-3:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Core Military Terms → Civilian Equivalents"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let's start with the most common military terms that appear on almost every military resume. These are the foundational translations you absolutely must make.

**[ON SCREEN: Split screen showing Military → Civilian]**

**PEOPLE & ORGANIZATION**

Military | Civilian
---------|----------
Subordinates | Direct reports, Team members, Staff
Soldiers/Marines/Airmen/Sailors | Personnel, Team members, Staff
Troops | Team, Workforce, Personnel
Squad | Team, Unit, Group
Platoon | Department, Division, Team
Company | Division, Business unit, Organization
Battalion/Regiment | Organization, Enterprise, Corporation
Chain of command | Reporting structure, Management hierarchy
Commander | Director, Executive, Leader
First Sergeant / Chief | Senior manager, Operations manager
NCO | Supervisor, Team leader, Manager

**[ON SCREEN: "Never use rank-specific terms like 'PFC' or 'Specialist'"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's the key: civilian hiring managers don't know the difference between a squad and a platoon, or a battalion and a brigade. Use the simplest, most universally understood term.

Instead of "Platoon Sergeant responsible for 42 soldiers"
Say: "Operations Manager leading 42-person team"

Instead of "Company First Sergeant for 120-soldier unit"
Say: "Senior Manager overseeing 120 personnel across 4 departments"

**[ON SCREEN: Operations & Activities]**

**OPERATIONS & ACTIVITIES**

Military | Civilian
---------|----------
Mission | Project, Initiative, Operation, Assignment
Operation | Project, Campaign, Initiative
Deployment | Assignment, Project period, On-site engagement
Exercise | Training event, Simulation, Drill
Combat zone | High-risk environment, Austere location, Hostile environment
Patrol | Route inspection, Security round, Monitoring activity
Brief/Briefing | Presentation, Report, Update
After Action Review | Post-project analysis, Lessons learned session
Standard Operating Procedure | Standard process, Operating procedure, Protocol
Field operations | On-site operations, Remote operations

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Notice that some military terms have multiple civilian equivalents depending on context. Choose the one that best fits the specific job you're applying for.

For a project manager role: "Mission" → "Project"
For a strategic planning role: "Mission" → "Initiative"
For an operations role: "Mission" → "Operation"

### PART 2: LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMENT TRANSLATIONS (3:30-6:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Leadership & Management Terms"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
This is where E5-E9 veterans really shine. You have extensive leadership experience, but you need to describe it in civilian terms.

**LEADERSHIP ACTIONS**

Military | Civilian
---------|----------
Led soldiers | Managed team, Supervised personnel, Led staff
Supervised subordinates | Managed direct reports, Oversaw team members
Commanded | Directed, Managed, Led, Oversaw
Trained troops | Trained personnel, Developed staff, Conducted training
Counseled soldiers | Mentored employees, Provided coaching, Performance management
Conducted NCOERs/OERs/FITREPs | Completed performance evaluations, Conducted performance reviews
Enforced discipline | Maintained standards, Ensured compliance, Managed accountability
Developed leaders | Leadership development, Succession planning, Mentored managers
Maintained morale | Built team culture, Improved engagement, Maintained retention
Inspected personnel/equipment | Conducted quality assurance, Performed audits, Quality control

**[ON SCREEN: Real example comparison]**

**BEFORE:**
"Squad leader responsible for training, discipline, and welfare of 12 soldiers"

**AFTER:**
"Team Lead managing 12 personnel, including performance development, standards compliance, and team welfare initiatives"

**[ON SCREEN: "Rank-Appropriate Language Matters"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now here's something critical: your civilian language should match your actual level of responsibility.

**E5-E6 Language:**
- Supervised (not "managed")
- Coordinated (not "directed")
- Led team (not "managed department")
- Assisted with (for senior-level functions)
- Trained personnel
- Maintained standards

**E7-E9 Language:**
- Managed, Directed, Oversaw
- Strategic planning
- Multi-department coordination
- Senior advisor, Subject matter expert
- Program manager
- Organizational leadership

**[ON SCREEN: Side-by-side comparison E5 vs E8]**

**E-5 (Sergeant) Resume Bullet:**
"Supervised 8-person team conducting daily operations and equipment maintenance"

**E-8 (Master Sergeant) Resume Bullet:**
"Directed 45-person operations department across 3 sections, managing $8M equipment inventory and training programs"

See the difference in scope and language?

**[ON SCREEN: "Don't Use Supply Class Numbers - Use Real Items"]**

### PART 5: COMMON JARGON MISTAKES & FIXES (12:00-14:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "The Most Common Jargon Mistakes"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me show you the jargon mistakes I see most often, and how to fix them:

**MISTAKE #1: Using acronyms without explanation**

❌ Wrong: "NCOIC for S-4 shop managing MTOE equipment and conducting PMCS"
✅ Right: "Operations Supervisor for logistics department managing equipment inventory and conducting preventive maintenance"

**[ON SCREEN: "Spell out acronyms - then eliminate them"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Don't just spell out acronyms - translate them to civilian concepts. Saying "Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge" is still jargon. Say "Supervisor" or "Team Lead."

**MISTAKE #2: Military-specific metrics that mean nothing to civilians**

❌ Wrong: "Achieved 95% on APFT" (Army Physical Fitness Test)
✅ Right: "Maintained exceptional physical fitness standards, exceeding organizational benchmarks"

❌ Wrong: "Expert marksman qualification"
✅ Right: "Advanced proficiency in weapons systems and safety protocols" (for security/law enforcement roles)

Or better yet - leave it off unless directly relevant to the job.

**MISTAKE #3: Using deployment names instead of describing the work**

❌ Wrong: "Deployed to Operation Inherent Resolve in support of CJTF-OIR"
✅ Right: "Deployed to Middle East for 9-month operations assignment managing security operations in hostile environment"

**[ON SCREEN: "Location and duration matter - operation name doesn't"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Civilian hiring managers don't know the difference between Operation Inherent Resolve, Operation Freedom's Sentinel, and Operation Enduring Freedom. They don't care. What they care about is:
- Where you went (Middle East, Afghanistan, etc.)
- How long you were there (9 months, 12 months)
- What you did (security operations, logistics, medical support)
- What you accomplished (results)

**MISTAKE #4: Awards and decorations that mean nothing to civilians**

❌ Wrong: "Awarded Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM) with V device"
✅ Right: "Recognized for exceptional performance under combat conditions with organizational commendation"

Or even better: describe WHAT you did that earned the award.

✅ Better: "Rescued 3 personnel under fire during ambush, demonstrating crisis leadership and decision-making under extreme pressure"

**MISTAKE #5: Military schooling that needs translation**

❌ Wrong: "Completed Advanced Leaders Course (ALC)"
✅ Right: "Completed intensive 6-week leadership development program (top 10% of class)"

❌ Wrong: "Airborne qualified"
✅ Right: (Only include if applying for tactical/physical roles, otherwise omit)

### CONCLUSION & WORKBOOK EXERCISE (14:00-15:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Your Action Steps"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Alright, let's recap the jargon elimination strategy:

1. Replace ALL rank and structure terms (subordinates → team members, platoon → department)
2. Translate operations and activities (mission → project, deployment → assignment)
3. Use rank-appropriate leadership language (E5-E6: supervised; E7-E9: directed/managed)
4. Eliminate ALL acronyms or translate them to civilian equivalents
5. Focus on what you DID and ACCOMPLISHED, not military-specific context

**[ON SCREEN: Workbook Exercise 2.1]**

**Your assignment:**

Go to your workbook, pages 19-28, and complete Exercise 2.1: "Jargon Elimination."

You're going to:
1. Take the 20 accomplishments you extracted in Exercise 1.2
2. Circle every piece of military jargon (terms, acronyms, ranks)
3. Use the translation tables from this lesson to replace each one
4. Rewrite all 20 accomplishments in 100% civilian language
5. Have a non-military friend or family member read them - if they ask "what does that mean?" you still have jargon

This exercise will take 45-60 minutes. Use the downloadable "Jargon Translation Quick Reference Guide" in your bonus materials.

In the next lesson, Lesson 2.2, we're going to focus on quantification - adding specific numbers and metrics to every single accomplishment.

See you in the next lesson!
