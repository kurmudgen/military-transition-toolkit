# VA Disability Rating for Liver Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Liver conditions are rated under various diagnostic codes (DC 7311-7354) with ratings from **0% to 100%** depending on severity. Common liver conditions include **Hepatitis B/C**, **fatty liver disease**, and **cirrhosis**. Service connection often involves **contaminated water exposure** (Camp Lejeune), **blood product exposure**, **vaccinations**, or **toxic exposures**. Claims typically take 6-12 months due to complexity.

## Common Liver Conditions

- Hepatitis B (DC 7312)
- Hepatitis C (DC 7354)
- Cirrhosis (DC 7312)
- Fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH)
- Liver damage from toxic exposure

## VA Rating Criteria

### Chronic Liver Disease (DC 7312)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Intermittent fatigue, malaise, anorexia, OR incapacitating episodes (with symptoms requiring bed rest and treatment by physician) totaling at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks during past 12 months |
| **20%** | Daily fatigue, malaise, anorexia (without weight loss or hepatomegaly) requiring dietary restriction or continuous medication, OR incapacitating episodes 2-4 weeks during past 12 months |
| **40%** | Daily fatigue, malaise, anorexia, with minor weight loss and hepatomegaly, OR incapacitating episodes 4-6 weeks during past 12 months |
| **60%** | Daily fatigue, malaise, anorexia, with substantial weight loss or other indication of malnutrition, and hepatomegaly, OR incapacitating episodes more than 6 weeks during past 12 months |
| **100%** | Near constant debilitating symptoms (fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, right upper quadrant pain), AND impending hepatic coma requiring hospitalization, OR portal hypertension, OR hepatic encephalopathy |

### Hepatitis C (DC 7354)

Uses same criteria as chronic liver disease (DC 7312).

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Camp Lejeune water exposure (presumptive)
- Blood product exposure documentation
- Vaccination records (jet injectors)
- Occupational exposure records
- In-service hepatitis diagnosis

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Hepatology/gastroenterology evaluation
- Liver biopsy results
- Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI)
- Lab results (liver enzymes, viral markers)

### Severity Evidence
- Progression of disease documented
- Treatment records
- Hospitalization records
- Weight loss documentation

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review liver disease history
2. Assess current symptoms
3. Review lab results and imaging
4. Document incapacitating episodes
5. Evaluate daily symptoms

**Document:**
- Frequency of fatigue, nausea, pain
- Weight changes
- Episodes requiring bed rest
- Hospitalizations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Hepatitis C presumptive for any veterans?
Not universally, but Camp Lejeune water exposure includes liver conditions as presumptive. Jet gun vaccination exposure is also a recognized risk factor.

### What about Camp Lejeune exposure?
Veterans stationed at Camp Lejeune 1953-1987 have presumptive conditions including liver disease/cancer due to contaminated water.

### Can I claim liver disease from jet gun vaccinations?
Yes. This is a recognized exposure pathway for Hepatitis B/C due to potential blood contamination between recipients.
