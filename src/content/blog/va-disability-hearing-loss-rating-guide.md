# VA Disability Rating for Hearing Loss: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Hearing loss is rated under **Diagnostic Code 6100** with ratings from **0% to 100%**, but **most veterans receive 0-10%** even with significant hearing loss. The VA uses a complex formula based on **speech discrimination scores** and **pure tone threshold averages** from audiometric testing. Unlike most conditions, the rating is determined by a rigid mathematical calculation—not examiner judgment. Service connection is usually easy to establish (military noise exposure), but getting a compensable rating requires objective hearing loss meeting specific criteria. Always claim **tinnitus** alongside hearing loss—it's a separate 10% rating. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Hearing Loss and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Hearing loss is reduced ability to hear sounds. It can be:
- **Sensorineural**: Damage to inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve—most common in veterans
- **Conductive**: Problems with outer or middle ear
- **Mixed**: Combination of both

**Military causes of hearing loss:**

- **Weapons fire**: Rifles, machine guns, artillery, grenades (extremely loud, repeated exposure)
- **Explosions**: IEDs, mortars, rockets, breaching charges
- **Aircraft noise**: Flight lines, helicopter operations, jet engines
- **Vehicle noise**: Tanks, APCs, ship engine rooms, HMMWVs
- **Industrial equipment**: Generators, machinery, power tools
- **Blast exposure**: Concussive injuries damaging hearing
- **Occupational noise**: Communications equipment, sonar (Navy)

**Why hearing loss claims are usually granted for service connection:**
The VA recognizes that virtually all military service involves noise exposure exceeding safe limits. Your MOS alone often establishes noise exposure. The challenge isn't proving service connection—it's getting a compensable rating.

## VA Rating Criteria for Hearing Loss

Hearing loss is rated under **38 CFR § 4.85-4.87, Diagnostic Code 6100**. The rating is calculated mechanically using tables—there's no examiner discretion on rating percentage.

### The Rating Process

**Step 1: Audiometric Testing**
The C&P audiogram measures:
- **Pure Tone Thresholds** at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz for each ear
- **Speech Discrimination Score** (Maryland CNC word list) for each ear

**Step 2: Calculate Pure Tone Threshold Average (PTA)**
Add the thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, then divide by 4.

Example:
- 1000 Hz: 25 dB
- 2000 Hz: 35 dB
- 3000 Hz: 45 dB
- 4000 Hz: 55 dB
- **PTA = (25+35+45+55)/4 = 40 dB**

**Step 3: Determine Numeric Designation Using Table VI**
Using your PTA and speech discrimination score, find your Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for each ear.

**Step 4: Find Rating Using Table VII**
Cross-reference the designations for both ears to find your rating percentage.

### Understanding the Tables

**Table VI: Numeric Designation Based on PTA and Speech Discrimination**

| PTA (dB) | % Speech Discrimination |
|----------|------------------------|
| | 92-100% | 84-90% | 76-82% | 68-74% | 60-66% | 52-58% | 44-50% | 36-42% | 0-34% |
| 0-41 | I | II | II | III | IV | IV | V | VI | VI |
| 42-49 | I | II | II | III | IV | IV | V | VI | VII |
| 50-57 | II | III | III | IV | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII |
| 58-65 | II | III | IV | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | VIII |
| 66-73 | III | IV | IV | V | VI | VI | VII | VIII | IX |
| 74-81 | III | IV | V | VI | VI | VII | VIII | VIII | IX |
| 82-89 | IV | V | VI | VI | VII | VIII | VIII | IX | X |
| 90-97 | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | VIII | IX | IX | X |
| 98+ | V | VI | VII | VIII | VIII | IX | IX | X | XI |

**Table VII: Percentage Evaluation (Simplified)**

| Better Ear | Poorer Ear Roman Numeral |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | IX | X | XI |
| I | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| II | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| III | | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 10 |
| IV | | | | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 20 |
| V | | | | | 0 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 20 | 20 | 30 |
| VI | | | | | | 10 | 10 | 20 | 20 | 30 | 40 |
| VII | | | | | | | 20 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
| VIII | | | | | | | | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 |
| IX | | | | | | | | | 50 | 60 | 70 |
| X | | | | | | | | | | 70 | 80 |
| XI | | | | | | | | | | | 100 |

### Table VIa: Exceptional Patterns of Hearing Impairment

Under 38 CFR § 4.86, if you have an exceptional pattern, you may use Table VIa (which doesn't require speech discrimination—just PTA):

**Exceptional Pattern (a):** Pure tone threshold is 55 dB or more at each of the four frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz)

**Exceptional Pattern (b):** Pure tone threshold is 30 dB or less at 1000 Hz and 70 dB or more at 2000 Hz

When exceptional patterns apply, the VA uses the table that produces the higher rating.

### Why Most Veterans Get 0%

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **The VA rating system is very strict.** You can have significant hearing loss that affects your daily life and still receive 0%.

Example:
- Veteran has PTA of 45 dB in both ears
- Speech discrimination of 88% in both ears
- Table VI: Both ears = Level II
- Table VII: Level II + Level II = **0%**

This veteran clearly has hearing loss and struggles in conversations, but the VA formula results in 0%.

**Why this matters:**
- Even 0% is service-connected (important for future increases and secondary claims)
- Claim tinnitus separately—that's 10% regardless of hearing loss rating
- If hearing worsens, you can file for increase

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**Noise exposure documentation:**
- MOS/rating that involves noise exposure
- DD-214 showing combat deployments
- Audiograms from service (especially showing hearing decline)
- Hearing conservation program records
- Personal statement about noise exposure

**Most MOSs establish noise exposure:**
Infantry, artillery, armor, aviation, military police, mechanics, engineers, naval personnel (especially below decks), and most others.

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA C&P audiogram** (required for rating)
   - Must use Maryland CNC word list for speech discrimination
   - Must test at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz
   - Must be conducted by licensed audiologist

2. **Private audiogram** (optional, helpful)
   - Can establish hearing loss exists before C&P
   - Must meet VA requirements to be used for rating

### Important Note on Service Connection

For VA purposes, hearing loss is a "disability" only when thresholds meet criteria in 38 CFR § 3.385:
- 26 dB or greater at any frequency (500-4000 Hz), OR
- Three frequencies at 26 dB or greater, OR
- Speech recognition less than 94% using Maryland CNC

You can be service-connected for hearing loss that doesn't meet disability criteria at separation if it meets criteria now and is connected to service noise exposure.

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The hearing loss C&P exam includes:

**Audiometric testing:**
1. You'll sit in a soundproof booth
2. Wear headphones
3. Press a button when you hear tones (pure tone testing)
4. Repeat words you hear (speech discrimination)

**What the examiner will ask:**
- "What type of noise were you exposed to in service?"
- "When did you notice hearing problems?"
- "Do you have difficulty hearing conversations?"
- "Do you use hearing aids?"

**Tips for accurate results:**

1. **Don't over-try or under-try**: Respond naturally to what you hear
2. **Rest before the exam**: Fatigue can affect results
3. **Avoid loud noise 24 hours before**: Temporary threshold shift can skew results
4. **Remove hearing aids before testing**: Test your unaided hearing
5. **Be honest about difficulty understanding words**: This affects speech discrimination

**What to tell them:**

1. **Describe all noise exposure**: Every weapon, vehicle, aircraft, explosion
2. **Explain functional impact**: "I can't hear my wife when she's not facing me"
3. **Mention hearing aid use**: If prescribed, this supports claim
4. **Don't exaggerate**: The audiogram is objective—they'll see if you're not responding accurately

**Common mistakes:**

- **Trying to "fail" the test**: Audiologists can detect inconsistent responses—this hurts credibility
- **Testing while fatigued**: Schedule exam when you're alert
- **Not reporting all noise exposure**: Be thorough
- **Forgetting to claim tinnitus**: Always claim tinnitus with hearing loss

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Hearing Loss

Always consider claiming related conditions:

1. **Tinnitus** - DC 6260
   - **ALWAYS claim this with hearing loss**
   - Same noise exposure causes both
   - Automatic 10% if recurrent
   - Claimed separately from hearing loss

2. **Meniere's Disease** - DC 6205
   - Causes hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus
   - Rated 30-100%
   - If you have vertigo episodes, consider this

3. **Depression/Anxiety** - DC 9434, 9400
   - Social isolation from hearing difficulty
   - Communication frustration

4. **Vestibular Disorders** - DC 6204
   - Inner ear damage affects balance
   - Dizziness, vertigo

5. **TBI** - DC 8045
   - If blast exposure caused both TBI and hearing loss

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "No current hearing loss disability"
**Why it happens:** Audiogram doesn't meet 38 CFR § 3.385 criteria
**How to avoid:**
- You need at least one frequency at 26+ dB or speech discrimination under 94%
- If borderline, get tested again—results can vary slightly

### 2. "No nexus to service"
**Why it happens:** Examiner attributes hearing loss to aging or other causes
**How to avoid:**
- Document military noise exposure thoroughly
- Show hearing was normal at entry, declined during/after service
- Get buddy statements about shared noise exposure

### 3. "Rating is 0%"
**Why it happens:** Formula calculation results in 0%
**How to understand:**
- This is still service-connected—important for future
- Claim tinnitus separately (10%)
- File for increase if hearing worsens

### 4. "Pre-existing hearing loss"
**Why it happens:** Entry audiogram showed some hearing loss
**How to avoid:**
- Argue aggravation during service
- Show worsening between entry and exit audiograms
- Document noise exposure that worsened condition

## Buddy Statement Tips for Hearing Loss

**For fellow service members:**
- Describe noise exposure you shared
- Note any complaints about hearing
- Confirm weapons, vehicles, events you were exposed to together

**For family members:**
- Describe hearing difficulties you've observed
- Specific situations (turning up TV, asking to repeat)
- Compare to hearing before service if applicable

**Example:**
"I am the spouse of [Veteran's Name]. Since they returned from service, I have noticed significant hearing difficulty. They frequently ask me to repeat myself and cannot hear me from another room. The TV volume is always set higher than comfortable for me. They often miss what people say in restaurants or group conversations. They complain about ringing in their ears regularly. These difficulties were not present before their military service / have worsened significantly since their service."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** If audiogram results were improperly applied to tables
**When to use:** If you believe the math was done wrong or exceptional pattern wasn't applied

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Getting a new audiogram
**What to submit:**
- New audiology examination
- Statement addressing prior denial reasons
- Additional evidence of noise exposure

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex nexus disputes
**When to use:** If service connection is denied despite obvious noise exposure

**Hearing loss appeal tips:**
- If rated 0%, file for increase when hearing worsens
- Get private audiogram to compare to VA results
- Challenge if exceptional pattern criteria met but not applied
- Don't forget tinnitus is a separate claim

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did I get 0% when I clearly have hearing loss?
The VA rating formula is very strict. Significant hearing loss can still result in 0%. The good news is 0% is still service-connected, which means:
- Free hearing aids from VA
- Future increases if hearing worsens
- Secondary conditions can be claimed

### Should I claim hearing loss even if I expect 0%?
Yes. Service connection matters for:
- VA healthcare and hearing aids
- Future increases when hearing worsens
- Secondary conditions
- Combined rating calculations

### Can I appeal a 0% rating?
You can, but the rating is based on objective audiogram results and a mathematical formula. Unless the exam was flawed or exceptional pattern criteria apply, the rating likely won't change. Better strategy: claim tinnitus (10%) and file for increase when hearing worsens.

### Does wearing hearing aids affect my rating?
No. The VA tests your unaided hearing. However, hearing aid use documents that you have significant hearing loss, which supports your claim.

### What if I have hearing loss in one ear only?
Unilateral (one ear) hearing loss is rated using Level I for the good ear. This often results in 0% unless the bad ear is severely affected.

### How do I prove noise exposure?
Your MOS usually establishes noise exposure. Document specific weapons, vehicles, and situations in your statement. Buddy statements help.

### Should I get a private audiogram before the C&P exam?
Optional but can be helpful. Make sure it meets VA requirements (Maryland CNC word list, frequencies tested) if you want it considered for rating.
