# Pennsylvania Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Pennsylvania operates eight VA medical centers (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Altoona, Erie, Lebanon, Wilkes-Barre, Coatesville, Butler) plus 46 outpatient clinics serving 700,000 veterans—the 5th largest veteran population in America. Coverage is excellent: 90%+ of PA veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh VAMCs are major facilities providing comprehensive care including specialty services, surgery, and inpatient treatment. Quality ratings are solid (3-4 stars average), though wait times for specialty care can reach 30-50 days.

For education, Pennsylvania offers outstanding GI Bill benefits. Penn State, Temple, and Pitt all provide in-state tuition for veterans (regardless of residency) and participate in Yellow Ribbon programs. Penn State's Yellow Ribbon is generous (unlimited for undergrads), making it essentially free for Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients. Pennsylvania has 14 state system universities and 15 community colleges—all GI Bill-approved with full tuition coverage. The standout state benefit: POW/MIA Grant ($1,200) for children of prisoners of war or missing in action service members.

Employment is strong but not elite. Pennsylvania's veteran unemployment rate is 3.2% (2024), slightly above the national average of 3.0%. However, Pennsylvania offers **absolute veterans' preference** for state jobs—one of only four states nationally with this policy. If you're qualified after an interview, the state must give you a conditional job offer before non-veterans. Major employers include BAE Systems (York), Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Fidelity, and numerous healthcare systems actively recruiting veterans.

Overall rating: **8/10** for healthcare (excellent coverage, multiple facilities), **9/10** for education (outstanding GI Bill schools, state benefits), **7/10** for employment (good opportunities, strong hiring preference).

## Employment & Career Resources

Pennsylvania's veteran unemployment rate is slightly above the national veteran average but better than the state's overall unemployment. With 700,000 veterans statewide, Pennsylvania has a strong veteran employment ecosystem.

### State Veteran Employment Programs

**Absolute Veterans' Preference for State Jobs**

Pennsylvania is one of only **four states nationally** (along with Massachusetts, New Jersey, South Dakota) that provides **absolute veterans' preference** for state government employment.

**How it works:**
- Veterans who pass civil service exams receive **10 points added** to their score
- If a veteran is qualified after the interview, **the state must make a conditional job offer to the veteran before non-veterans**
- This is "absolute" preference—not just tie-breaking

**Eligibility:**
- Honorably discharged veterans who completed initial contractual military service obligation
- Surviving spouses of deceased veterans
- Spouses of disabled veterans

**Important:** Veterans' preference does NOT apply to promotions, only initial hiring.

**Where to apply:** Commonwealth of Pennsylvania jobs at employment.pa.gov | (866) 234-5627

This is a massive advantage. If you're qualified, you get hired before non-veterans—period.
