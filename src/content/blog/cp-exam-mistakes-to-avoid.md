# C&P Exam Mistakes: 10 Things That Hurt Your VA Claim

## Bottom Line Up Front

Thousands of veterans receive lower disability ratings than they deserve—not because their conditions aren't severe, but because they made avoidable mistakes during their C&P exam. The exam is often the deciding factor in your claim. These 10 mistakes can cost you hundreds of dollars per month in compensation. Learn what they are and how to avoid them.

## The Cost of Mistakes

A single C&P exam mistake can mean the difference between:
- **30% rating** ($524/month) vs **70% rating** ($1,716/month)
- That's **$14,304 per year** left on the table
- Over 20 years: **$286,080** in lost benefits

The stakes are high. Don't make these mistakes.

## Mistake #1: Being Too Tough

**The Problem:**
Military culture trained you to minimize pain, push through injuries, and never complain. Those instincts will destroy your VA claim.

Veterans say things like:
- "It's not that bad."
- "I've dealt with worse."
- "Other veterans have it harder."
- "I can still function."

The examiner writes down exactly what you say. **"It's not that bad"** = lower rating.

**The Fix:**
Be honest about your condition. Describe your symptoms accurately—especially your worst days.

**Instead of:** "My back bothers me sometimes."
**Say:** "I have constant back pain that I'd rate a 5-6 out of 10 on a daily basis. On bad days it's 8 or 9. I can't bend over without severe pain. I can't sit for more than 20 minutes. I've had to change how I do everything."

You're not complaining. You're accurately reporting a medical condition for evaluation.

## Mistake #2: Not Describing Flare-Ups

**The Problem:**
The VA rates musculoskeletal conditions based on range of motion. If you get measured on a good day, you get a good-day rating.

Many veterans never mention flare-ups. The examiner doesn't ask, the veteran doesn't volunteer, and the rating doesn't reflect the true severity.

**The Fix:**
Proactively describe your flare-ups:
- How often they occur
- What triggers them
- How severe they are
- How much additional limitation you experience
- How long they last

**Example:** "I have flare-ups about 3 times per week. When they happen, my pain increases from 5/10 to 8/10, and I'd estimate I lose an additional 20-30 degrees of motion. I can barely move during a flare-up. They're triggered by activity, weather changes, and sleeping wrong. They usually last 1-2 days."

Under *DeLuca v. Brown*, the examiner must consider flare-ups. But only if you describe them.

---

## Mistake #3: Forgetting Medications

**The Problem:**
The examiner asks about medications. The veteran says "I take some pills" but can't name them, state the dosages, or explain what they're for.

Medications are evidence of severity. Strong pain medications prove significant pain. Multiple psychiatric medications prove serious mental health conditions. Not knowing your medications makes you look unprepared and may cause the examiner to underestimate your condition.

**The Fix:**
Bring a complete medication list with:
- Medication name
- Dosage
- Frequency
- What it's prescribed for
- How long you've been taking it

Also mention medications you've tried that didn't work—this shows the progression of your condition.

---

## Mistake #4: Not Mentioning Daily Impact

**The Problem:**
The veteran describes symptoms but not how those symptoms affect daily life. The examiner hears "knee pain" but not "can't play with my kids, can't climb stairs, had to quit my job."

Ratings are based on **functional impairment**, not just symptoms. If you don't describe functional impact, you don't demonstrate impairment.

**The Fix:**
For every symptom, explain the function it impairs:

| Symptom | Functional Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| Back pain | Can't sit for more than 30 minutes, can't lift more than 10 lbs, can't bend to tie shoes |
| Knee pain | Can't climb stairs, can't squat, can't stand more than 15 minutes |
| PTSD nightmares | Can't sleep more than 3-4 hours, exhausted at work, marriage suffering |
| Anxiety | Can't go to crowded places, panic attacks prevent driving, isolated from friends |

---

## Mistake #5: Going to the Exam "Feeling Good"

**The Problem:**
Some veterans take extra pain medication before the exam to feel better. Or they happen to schedule the exam on a good day. The examiner sees them at their best, not their typical or worst state.

**The Fix:**
- Take your medications as normally scheduled—don't take extra to feel better
- Don't reschedule just because you're having a bad day (bad days are evidence)
- If it is a good day, tell the examiner: "Today is actually better than usual. On my bad days, which are [X] times per week, my symptoms are much worse."

---

## Mistake #6: Not Wearing/Bringing Assistive Devices

**The Problem:**
The veteran uses a knee brace daily but doesn't wear it to the exam. Uses a cane but left it at home. The examiner sees no assistive devices and assumes they're not needed.

**The Fix:**
Bring and **wear** any assistive devices you use:
- Knee braces
- Back braces
- Canes or walkers
- Compression garments
- CPAP machine compliance data (for sleep apnea)
- Hearing aids

If you use it, show it. Visual evidence matters.

---

## Mistake #7: Being Inconsistent

**The Problem:**
The veteran tells the examiner one thing but their medical records say another. Or they describe symptoms differently than they did in their personal statement. The examiner notes the inconsistency, and credibility is damaged.

**The Fix:**
- Review your medical records before the exam
- Review your personal statement
- Be consistent in describing onset, symptoms, and severity
- If something has changed, explain how and when: "My condition has worsened since I filed. In my initial statement, I said my pain was 4/10. Now it's consistently 6-7/10."

---

## Mistake #8: Not Knowing Your Own Claim

**The Problem:**
The veteran doesn't know what conditions they're being examined for, doesn't understand the rating criteria, and can't articulate how their condition meets those criteria.

**The Fix:**
Before your exam:
- Know exactly what condition(s) you're claiming
- Understand how that condition is rated (rating criteria)
- Know what evidence supports a higher rating
- Prepare to explain how your symptoms meet those criteria

**Example for back pain:** "I understand back conditions are rated based on range of motion. My forward flexion is limited due to pain. I also have flare-ups that further limit my motion. I have radiculopathy down my leg that should be rated separately."

---

## Mistake #9: Assuming the Examiner Read Your File

**The Problem:**
C&P examiners see many veterans daily. They may have only glanced at your file. The veteran assumes the examiner knows everything and doesn't provide key information.

**The Fix:**
Treat every exam as if the examiner knows nothing about you:
- Explain your military service
- Describe the in-service incident that caused your condition
- Summarize your treatment history
- Detail your current symptoms
- Describe functional impact

Don't assume. Inform.

---

## Mistake #10: Not Asking Questions or Clarifying

**The Problem:**
The exam ends, but the veteran realizes the examiner never asked about a key symptom, never tested stability, or never addressed flare-ups. The veteran says nothing and leaves.

**The Fix:**
If something important wasn't covered, speak up:

- "I want to make sure you documented my flare-ups. Did you get that information?"
- "Are you going to test the stability of my knee?"
- "I also have [secondary symptom] that I wanted to make sure was noted."
- "I'd like to make sure you have information about how this affects my work."

You have the right to ensure the exam is complete. Don't leave with key information uncovered.

## Bonus Mistakes to Avoid

### Showing Up Late or Missing the Exam
Missing your C&P exam delays your claim by months. If you must reschedule, do it in advance.

### Being Hostile or Argumentative
The examiner isn't your enemy. Being combative doesn't help your case and may result in negative notes.

### Not Following Up
After the exam, request a copy of the examiner's report. Review it for accuracy. If it's wrong, you have grounds for appeal.

### Exaggerating
Don't exaggerate. Examiners are trained to spot it. If caught, your entire credibility is destroyed. Honesty is the policy—just honest about your worst days, not your best.

## What a Good C&P Exam Looks Like

**Prepared Veteran Example:**

*Examiner: "Tell me about your back condition."*

*Veteran: "I injured my back during an airborne operation in 2015. I've had chronic pain ever since. Currently, my daily pain is 5-6 out of 10. I take [specific medications] but they only take the edge off. I have flare-ups about 3 times per week where the pain increases to 8-9 out of 10 and I lose significant range of motion—probably an additional 20-30 degrees. During flare-ups, I can barely get out of bed. I can't sit for more than 30 minutes, can't bend to pick things up, and can't lift more than 10 pounds. I had to leave my job as a [job title] because I couldn't perform the physical requirements. I use a back brace daily, which I'm wearing now. I also have shooting pain down my left leg that my doctor says is radiculopathy, which I understand should be rated separately."*

That's a veteran who will get an accurate rating.

## Post-Exam Action Items

1. **Take notes immediately** after the exam
   - What was asked
   - What tests were done
   - How long it lasted
   - Anything concerning

2. **Request the exam report** once your decision comes
   - Review for accuracy
   - Note any errors or omissions

3. **If something's wrong:**
   - File Higher-Level Review (for errors)
   - File Supplemental Claim (with new evidence)
   - Get a private medical opinion to counter inaccurate findings

---

## Final Thought

The C&P exam is your moment to ensure the VA understands your condition. The examiner's report often determines your rating. Don't let avoidable mistakes cost you the compensation you've earned.

Prepare. Show up with documentation. Describe your worst days. Explain functional impact. Don't minimize. Don't exaggerate. Be consistent.

Your service matters. Make sure your exam reflects that.
