# C&P Exam Mistakes: 10 Things That Hurt Your VA Claim (2025)

The C&P exam is where claims are won or lost. The examiner's findings directly determine your rating—and many veterans sabotage their own claims through avoidable mistakes.

Here are the 10 most damaging C&P exam mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Mistake #1: Missing the Appointment

**Why it hurts:** A missed C&P exam typically results in claim denial or rating based solely on existing evidence (usually unfavorable).

**Real impact:**
- VA may deny your entire claim
- At minimum, decision is delayed by months
- Multiple missed exams can result in automatic denial

**How to avoid it:**
- Mark the date immediately when you get the notification
- Set multiple reminders
- Confirm the location (it may not be at your regular VA)
- If you absolutely cannot attend, call to reschedule BEFORE the appointment
- Arrive 15-30 minutes early

**If you miss it:** Call immediately. Have a valid reason ready. One reschedule is usually granted; multiple misses are problematic.

## Mistake #2: Minimizing Your Symptoms

**Why it hurts:** The military trained you to be tough and push through. This is the opposite of what you should do at a C&P exam.

**What veterans say:**
- "I manage okay."
- "It's not that bad."
- "I get by."
- "Other people have it worse."

**What the examiner hears:** This veteran's condition is mild and doesn't significantly affect their life.

**Real impact:** Lower rating than you deserve because you didn't communicate actual impairment.

**How to avoid it:**
- Describe your worst days, not your best
- Be specific about limitations: "I can't lift more than 10 pounds" not "lifting is hard sometimes"
- Explain impact on work, relationships, and daily activities
- Don't compare yourself to others—this is about YOUR condition

## Mistake #3: Exaggerating Symptoms

**Why it hurts:** C&P examiners are trained to detect inconsistencies. Exaggeration destroys your credibility.

**Red flags examiners watch for:**
- Symptoms that don't match medical records
- Inconsistent statements during the exam
- Physical findings that contradict verbal complaints
- Symptoms that don't follow known medical patterns
- Observation in waiting room vs. exam room behavior

**Real impact:**
- Examiner notes "symptom magnification" or "inconsistent effort"
- VA may deny claim entirely
- Affects credibility of all future claims

**How to avoid it:**
- Be honestly accurate
- Describe what you actually experience
- Don't perform worse than your real condition
- If you feel worse than your records show, explain why (recent worsening, never reported symptoms before, etc.)

## Mistake #4: Not Mentioning Flare-Ups

**Why it hurts:** If you only describe how you feel today, the examiner can only rate what they observe. Flare-ups may represent your true level of impairment.

**What veterans forget to say:**
- "This happens worse sometimes"
- "I have episodes where..."
- "Most days are worse than today"

**Real impact:** Rating based on a single snapshot instead of your actual ongoing condition.

**How to avoid it:**
- Proactively discuss flare-ups:
  - Frequency: "About twice a week"
  - Duration: "They last 2-3 days"
  - Severity: "During flare-ups, I can barely move"
  - Triggers: "Usually after physical activity"
- Say: "Today is actually a pretty good day for me"
- The examiner should estimate function during flare-ups

## Mistake #5: Pushing Through Pain During Physical Tests

**Why it hurts:** For musculoskeletal exams, the examiner measures where PAIN limits movement, not your maximum physical capability.

**What veterans do:**
- Grit teeth and push through pain
- Try to demonstrate full range of motion despite agony
- Treat it like a physical fitness test

**Real impact:**
- Examiner records normal range of motion
- Rating based on physical ability, not functional limitation
- You get 10% when you deserved 20% or 30%

**How to avoid it:**
- Stop movement when significant pain begins
- Tell the examiner: "This is where the pain stops me"
- Don't try to impress anyone with toughness
- Your "PT test attitude" works against you here

## Mistake #6: Not Preparing Before the Exam

**Why it hurts:** Pain, anxiety, and the unfamiliar environment can make you forget important information.

**What unprepared veterans miss:**
- Specific symptoms they experience
- Examples of how conditions affect daily life
- Details about flare-ups
- Medications and treatments
- Secondary conditions to mention

**Real impact:** Incomplete picture leads to incomplete rating.

**How to avoid it:**
- Write down symptoms, flare-up frequency, and limitations
- Bring this list and reference it during the exam
- Prepare specific examples: "Last week, I couldn't..."
- Review your claim before the appointment

## Mistake #7: Taking Extra Pain Medication Before the Exam

**Why it hurts:** You want the examiner to see your actual condition, not an artificially improved version.

**What veterans think:** "I'll take extra meds so I can function better at the exam."

**Real impact:**
- Pain levels appear lower than normal
- Range of motion may appear better than typical
- You appear less impaired than you actually are
- Examiner documents a milder condition

**How to avoid it:**
- Take your normal medications at normal times
- Don't add extra doses before the exam
- If you're concerned about being able to drive, have someone take you
- If you're having an unusually bad day, go anyway—that's valid data

## Mistake #8: Being Vague Instead of Specific

**Why it hurts:** Vague statements don't help the examiner rate your condition.

**Vague (bad):**
- "My back hurts a lot"
- "I have trouble sleeping"
- "I can't do things I used to"

**Specific (good):**
- "My back pain is an 8 out of 10 most days. I can't stand for more than 15 minutes or sit for more than 30 minutes without repositioning"
- "I wake up 3-4 times per night. Most nights I get 3-4 hours of broken sleep"
- "I used to hike every weekend. Now I can't walk more than half a mile without my knee giving out"

**Real impact:** Specific information allows accurate rating. Vague information results in conservative rating.

**How to avoid it:**
- Quantify: How many times? How long? What percentage?
- Provide examples: "Last week, I..."
- Explain impact: "Because of this, I can't..."

## Mistake #9: Not Mentioning All Relevant Conditions

**Why it hurts:** Examiners only evaluate what's on their assignment. If you don't bring up secondary symptoms, they may not be documented.

**What veterans forget:**
- Radiculopathy (nerve symptoms) with back/neck conditions
- Depression/anxiety with chronic pain
- Sleep problems with PTSD
- Sexual dysfunction with various conditions
- Secondary conditions they didn't realize were connected

**Real impact:**
- Secondary conditions go unrated
- Miss opportunity to add to claim
- Have to file separate claims later (delayed benefits)

**How to avoid it:**
- At the beginning: "I want to make sure we cover all my symptoms..."
- Mention radiating pain, numbness, tingling
- Mention mental health impacts
- Ask: "Is this exam covering all my claimed conditions?"

## Mistake #10: Giving Up After One Bad Exam

**Why it hurts:** One examiner's opinion isn't the final word.

**What veterans think:**
- "The examiner seemed skeptical, so I'll be denied"
- "I answered something wrong, it's over"
- "The exam was too short to capture everything"

**Real impact:** Many claims are won on appeal. Giving up means accepting an unfair result.

**What you can do:**
- Request a copy of the DBQ (exam results)
- Review for errors and omissions
- File a Supplemental Claim with new evidence
- Get a private nexus letter if the VA examiner was negative
- Request Higher Level Review for obvious errors
- Appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals

**Statistics:** Many initially denied claims succeed on appeal with additional evidence.

## Bonus Mistake: Arguing with the Examiner

**Why it hurts:** The examiner is doing their job. Hostility doesn't change their opinion—it may negatively affect how they document the encounter.

**What not to do:**
- Challenge the examiner's credentials
- Argue about their preliminary findings
- Get angry or confrontational
- Accuse them of trying to deny your claim

**What to do instead:**
- Stay calm and cooperative
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Provide information, not arguments
- Save disagreements for the appeals process

## Quick Reference: Do's and Don'ts

### DO:
- Attend the exam (or reschedule in advance)
- Describe your worst days
- Stop movement when pain begins
- Bring written notes
- Mention flare-ups proactively
- Be specific with examples

## Bottom Line

These mistakes cost veterans thousands of dollars in compensation they've earned. The C&P exam is too important to wing it.

**Most important takeaways:**
1. Don't miss the exam
2. Don't minimize—describe your actual impairment
3. Don't push through pain during physical tests
4. Prepare written notes and bring them
5. If the exam goes badly, appeal

Your rating depends on this exam. Avoid these mistakes.
