# Hawaii Military Retirement: Best Cities, Housing Costs & Island Living Reality 2025

Hawaii offers veterans year-round perfect weather, unmatched natural beauty, complete military retirement income tax exemption, and full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans. But Hawaii also delivers the **highest cost of living in the United States** - median home prices exceed $1 million on Oahu, groceries cost 50% more than the mainland, and even "affordable" areas in Hawaii cost more than expensive cities on the mainland.

Choosing where to live in Hawaii matters enormously. Oahu offers jobs, VA healthcare, and services but brutal housing costs. The Big Island is more "affordable" (still expensive) with limited employment. Maui is stunningly beautiful and catastrophically expensive. Kauai is remote, rainy, and isolated from everything.

This guide ranks Hawaii's best areas for veterans with brutal honesty about housing costs, employment reality, and who can actually afford to live here.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Best overall for veterans**: Honolulu/Oahu (jobs, VA medical center, services, but expensive)
**Best for military connection**: Central Oahu near bases (Mililani, Aiea, Pearl City)
**Most "affordable"**: Hilo, Big Island (still expensive, but cheapest major town in Hawaii)
**Best for outdoor lifestyle**: Kona, Big Island or North Shore Oahu (if you can afford it)
**Most beautiful**: Maui or Kauai (but prepare to be broke)

**Median home price range**: $700,000 (Hilo) to $1,200,000 (Oahu single-family)
**Cost of living**: 77-90% above national average across all areas
**Reality check**: Unless you're earning $100K+ household income, have 100% VA disability, or own a home outright, you'll struggle financially in ANY Hawaii location.

## The Island Decision: Oahu vs. Neighbor Islands

Before diving into specific cities, understand the fundamental tradeoff:

### Oahu (Honolulu County)

**Population**: 1,000,000 (70% of Hawaii's population)
**Veteran population**: 60,000+ (majority of Hawaii's 89,000 veterans)

**Pros**:
- VA medical center (only one in Hawaii)
- Most jobs (JBPHH, Schofield, MCBH, civilian employers)
- Urban services and amenities
- Multiple military bases
- Most veteran community
- University of Hawaii Mānoa (flagship)

**Cons**:
- Most expensive housing ($1.2M median single-family home)
- Traffic congestion (real, not Hawaii-style joke)
- Crowded beaches and trails
- Urban density (Honolulu is a real city)

### Neighbor Islands (Maui, Big Island, Kauai)

**Population**: 430,000 combined
**Veteran population**: ~25,000-30,000 combined

**Pros**:
- More "authentic" Hawaii (less urbanized)
- Slower pace of life
- Less traffic
- More space
- Big Island has "affordable" options (relatively)

**Cons**:
- Must fly to Oahu for complex VA care ($200-$400 round-trip)
- Very limited employment outside tourism
- Geographic isolation from mainland (and Oahu)
- Higher shipping costs for goods
- Smaller veteran community

**The fundamental question**: Do you need regular VA care? Do you need employment? If yes to either, **choose Oahu**. If you're retired, 100% disabled, or work remotely, neighbor islands become viable.

## Top Cities/Areas for Veterans in Hawaii

## Key Takeaways

1. **Oahu is the practical choice** for most veterans needing VA care, jobs, or services

2. **Every location in Hawaii is expensive** - even "affordable" Hilo costs 75% more than national average

3. **You need $100K+ household income minimum** to live reasonably in Hawaii (more for families)

4. **100% disability exemption is game-changer** - saves $3,000-$7,000+/year and makes Hawaii more viable

5. **Neighbor islands require**:
   - Retirement or remote work (limited local employment)
   - Willingness to fly to Oahu for complex VA care
   - Higher income than you think (isolation increases costs)

6. **Housing costs dominate** - even with tax exemptions, you must afford the mortgage/rent

7. **Most military retirees cannot afford Hawaii** on retirement income alone without substantial disability compensation, working spouse, or paid-off home

8. **Choose Hawaii for lifestyle, not finances** - paradise has a very high price

## Final Recommendation

**Visit Hawaii for 2-4 weeks before relocating.** Rent an Airbnb, shop at local grocery stores, drive in traffic, experience daily life. The tourist experience is completely different from living here.

**Rent for 1 year before buying.** Hawaii real estate is expensive and illiquid. Make sure you can handle the costs, weather, and isolation before committing $1M+ to a home.

**Run your personal budget ruthlessly.** Don't assume you'll "figure it out" or "make it work." The math either works or it doesn't. Most veterans who move here without adequate income end up leaving within 2-3 years.

**Consider alternatives.** If you can't afford Hawaii, consider Guam (similar climate, lower costs, VA facility, military presence) or San Diego/Southern California (military presence, jobs, VA facilities, better affordability than Hawaii).

Hawaii is paradise, but paradise is expensive. Be honest about whether you can afford it before making the leap.
