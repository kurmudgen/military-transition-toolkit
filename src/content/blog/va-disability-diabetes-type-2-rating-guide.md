# VA Disability Rating for Type 2 Diabetes: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Type 2 Diabetes is rated under **Diagnostic Code 7913** with ratings of **10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, or 100%**. Most veterans receive **20%** (requiring insulin and restricted diet). Diabetes is **presumptively service-connected** for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange/herbicides. The key to higher ratings is documenting **insulin use**, **activity regulation**, and **complications**. Diabetes often leads to numerous **secondary conditions** (peripheral neuropathy, kidney disease, vision problems) rated separately. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Type 2 Diabetes?

Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). The body either resists insulin or doesn't produce enough.

**Military connections:**

**Agent Orange/Herbicide Presumptive:**
Type 2 diabetes is presumptively associated with herbicide exposure for veterans who served in:
- Vietnam (1962-1975)
- Thailand (certain bases)
- Korean DMZ (1968-1971)
- Areas with documented herbicide use

**Other connections:**
- Onset during service
- Secondary to sleep apnea
- Related to obesity from service-connected conditions
- Gestational diabetes during service (women)

## VA Rating Criteria

Type 2 Diabetes is rated under **38 CFR § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Manageable by restricted diet only |
| **20%** | Requiring insulin and restricted diet, OR oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet |
| **40%** | Requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities |
| **60%** | Requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated |
| **100%** | Requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus progressive loss of weight and strength attributable to diabetes |

### Key Terms

- **Regulation of activities**: Medical need to avoid strenuous activity due to diabetes
- **Restricted diet**: Medically prescribed dietary limitations
- **Ketoacidosis/Hypoglycemic reactions**: Dangerous blood sugar extremes

### Important: Complications Rated Separately

Diabetic complications are rated SEPARATELY under their own codes:
- Peripheral neuropathy (each extremity)
- Nephropathy (kidney disease)
- Retinopathy (vision)
- Erectile dysfunction
- Cardiovascular conditions

**Your diabetes rating + separate ratings for each complication = potentially very high combined rating.**

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- For Agent Orange: DD-214 showing qualifying service
- Service treatment records showing onset
- Evidence of herbicide exposure

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Diagnosis from physician
- HbA1C levels
- Treatment records

### Severity Evidence
- Medication records (insulin type and frequency)
- Diet restrictions documentation
- Activity regulation by physician
- Hospitalization records
- Complication documentation

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Confirm diagnosis
2. Review treatment regimen
3. Document insulin requirements
4. Assess activity regulation
5. Identify complications

**What to tell them:**
- All diabetes medications (insulin type, frequency, dosage)
- Dietary restrictions
- Activity limitations prescribed by doctor
- Hospitalizations for diabetes
- All complications (numbness, vision, kidney problems)

## Secondary Conditions (Rate Separately)

**These are rated IN ADDITION to diabetes rating:**

1. **Peripheral Neuropathy** (each extremity) - DC 8520
   - Each arm and leg rated separately
   - 10-70% per extremity

2. **Diabetic Nephropathy** - DC 7541
   - Kidney disease
   - 0-100%

3. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - DC 6006
   - Vision problems
   - Based on visual impairment

4. **Erectile Dysfunction** - DC 7522
   - Special Monthly Compensation available

5. **Coronary Artery Disease** - DC 7005
   - Heart conditions
   - 10-100%

6. **Peripheral Vascular Disease** - Various DCs
   - Circulation problems

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is diabetes automatic for Vietnam veterans?
Yes, if you have qualifying service and a current diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, it's presumptively service-connected.

### What's the difference between 20% and 40%?
20% requires insulin OR oral medication with diet. 40% requires insulin with diet AND physician-prescribed regulation of activities.

### How do I get "regulation of activities"?
Your doctor must medically advise you to avoid strenuous activity due to diabetes risk. This must be documented.

### Can I claim complications separately?
Yes! This is critical. Peripheral neuropathy, kidney disease, vision problems, and other complications are rated separately from diabetes itself.

### What if I'm on oral medications only, not insulin?
Oral hypoglycemic agent with restricted diet = 20%.
