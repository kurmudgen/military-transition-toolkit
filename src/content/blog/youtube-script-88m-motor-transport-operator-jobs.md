[MAIN CONTENT - 6-7 minutes]

**Section 1: Your Market Value and Reality Check (90 seconds)**

Let's talk real numbers for truck drivers in 2025.

[Visual suggestion: Salary breakdown by type]

**Average 88M civilian truck driver salary:** $56,280/year or $27/hour

But that average is misleading. Your actual pay depends on:

**Type of Trucking:**
- Local/Regional delivery: $50,000-$70,000/year
- Long-haul OTR (over-the-road): $55,000-$85,000/year
- Specialized (hazmat, oversized, etc.): $70,000-$95,000/year
- Owner-operator: $100,000-$200,000/year (but you own the truck)
- LTL (Less Than Truckload) carriers: $70,000-$95,000/year

**By experience:**
- Entry level (0-1 year): $45,000-$60,000/year
- Experienced (3-5 years): $65,000-$85,000/year
- Specialized/Team driving: $80,000-$110,000/year

**Reality check:** That $100K+ salary you see advertised? It usually means:
- You're living in your truck (OTR, home 4 days/month)
- Team driving (you and another driver, truck never stops)
- Owner-operator (you own truck, pay all expenses)
- Hauling hazmat or dangerous goods

Most 88Ms transitioning will start at $55K-$70K for regional routes with weekends home.

**Section 2: Get Your CDL for FREE (90 seconds)**

Here's what 88Ms need to know: Do NOT pay for CDL training. You can get it completely free.

[Visual suggestion: Free CDL programs list]

**GI Bill Covers CDL Training:**

CDL training costs $3,000-$6,000 normally. GI Bill covers:
- Full tuition at VA-approved truck driving schools
- Monthly housing allowance ($1,500-$2,500 while training)
- Books and supplies stipend

**Training timeline:** 3-8 weeks depending on program

**VA-approved CDL schools:**
- Roadmaster Drivers School (nationwide)
- SAGE Truck Driving Schools (multiple states)
- 160 Driving Academy (nationwide)
- Most community colleges with CDL programs

**Troops to Truckers Program:**

Many states have "Troops to Truckers" that lets 88Ms:
- Skip the skills test portion
- Head straight to written test
- Get Class A CDL faster
- Check your state DMV for this program

**Military Skills Test Waiver:**

Some states allow 88Ms to waive portions of CDL test based on military experience. This varies by state - check your state's DMV website.

**Company-Paid CDL Training:**

If you don't want to use GI Bill, many carriers offer free CDL training:
- **Schneider National:** Free training, $500/week during training
- **Swift Transportation:** Free training, job guarantee
- **Werner Enterprises:** Free CDL program
- **Prime Inc:** Free training, company pays you while training

**Warning on company-paid training:** Usually requires 1-year contract. If you quit early, you owe them $3,000-$7,000 for training. Not a problem if you stay, but read the contract.

**Section 3: Best Companies for Veteran Drivers (120 seconds)**

[Visual suggestion: Specialized endorsement requirements]

**Hazmat Hauling:**
- Salary: $70,000-$95,000/year
- Requires Hazmat endorsement on CDL

- More planning, slower pace

**Tanker (Liquid Bulk):**

**Auto Transport:**

**Cost:** Each endorsement is $20-$100. DoD COOL may cover these.

**Section 5: The Owner-Operator Question (60 seconds)**

Should you buy your own truck? Short answer for most 88Ms: No. At least not for 3-5 years.

[Visual suggestion: Owner-operator pro/con list]

**Owner-Operator Potential:**
- Gross revenue: $150,000-$250,000/year
- Take-home after expenses: $70,000-$150,000/year (wide range)

**Your expenses:**
- Truck payment or cash purchase: $60,000-$180,000
- Insurance: $10,000-$18,000/year
- Fuel: $40,000-$70,000/year
- Maintenance: $15,000-$25,000/year
- Permits, plates, taxes: $5,000-$10,000/year

**When it makes sense:**
- You have 3-5 years experience
- You have excellent credit (financing) or $60K+ cash
- You have consistent contracts lined up
- You're good with business/accounting
- You can handle variability in income

**When it doesn't make sense:**
- You're fresh out of the Army
- You don't have business experience
- You want stable income
- You don't have $30K-$60K saved for emergencies

**Better path:** Drive for a company 3-5 years, learn the business, save money, then consider owner-operator if you want.

**Section 6: Lifestyle Reality Check (60 seconds)**

Let's be honest about trucking life because recruiters won't tell you this:

[Visual suggestion: Work schedule comparison]

**OTR (Over-the-Road):**
- Out: 3-4 weeks at a time
- Home: 3-4 days per month
- Pay: $60K-$85K
- Who it works for: Single, no kids, want to see the country
- Who it destroys: Married, kids, relationships

**Regional:**
- Out: Monday-Friday
- Home: Weekends
- Pay: $55K-$75K
- Who it works for: Most people, best work-life balance

**Local/Dedicated:**
- Out: Daily, home every night
- Home: Every night
- Pay: $50K-$70K (up to $90K at top companies)
- Who it works for: Family people, want routine
- Trade-off: Usually more physical (loading/unloading)

**The real question:** What's worth more to you? $10K extra per year or being home for dinner with your kids every night?

[CONCLUSION - 30 seconds]

**Summary:**

88Ms have a massive advantage: you already know how to drive big vehicles, you understand DOT regulations, and companies want you.

**Best path:**
1. Get free CDL through GI Bill (3-8 weeks, costs you $0)
2. Start with stable company: Schneider, JB Hunt, or regional LTL carrier
3. Aim for $60K-$75K first year
4. Get hazmat and tanker endorsements after year one
5. Move to specialized routes: $75K-$95K in years 2-5

**Top companies:** Old Dominion, UPS Freight, Schneider for veterans

**Avoid:** Long-haul OTR if you have family (3 weeks out, 3 days home = destroyed relationships)

**Next step:** Apply to 3 VA-approved CDL schools this week, use your GI Bill, get your Class A CDL.
