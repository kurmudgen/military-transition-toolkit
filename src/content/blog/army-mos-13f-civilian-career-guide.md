## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 13F Fire Support Specialists transitioning out—your **fire support coordination, target identification, intelligence analysis, close air support operations, JTAC qualifications (if held), operations planning, multi-domain coordination, communications proficiency, and proven ability to execute precision missions under fire** make you highly competitive across intelligence analysis, law enforcement, operations coordination, defense contracting, emergency management, and technical training. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$60,000-$85,000** in law enforcement, intelligence analysis, or operations roles, scaling to **$95,000-$150,000** in federal law enforcement, defense intelligence, or senior operations positions. JTAC-qualified contractors, targeting analysts, and senior training roles can earn **$120,000-$200,000+**.

You didn't just "call for fire"—you coordinated precision fires across artillery, mortars, close air support, and naval gunfire; analyzed terrain and enemy activity to identify high-value targets; operated advanced targeting systems and communications equipment; coordinated with aircraft, gunships, drones, and artillery batteries requiring split-second timing; maintained situational awareness across multiple fire support assets; made life-or-death decisions calling danger-close missions; integrated intelligence to support maneuver operations; and executed in the most demanding tactical environment where errors meant friendly casualties. That's multi-domain coordination, intelligence analysis, tactical decision-making, crisis management, technical proficiency, and operational excellence. The civilian world needs those skills—you just need to target industries where fire support experience translates to operational value.

Most 13F specialists transition to intelligence analysis (especially geospatial and targeting), law enforcement (especially tactical/SWAT), defense contracting (JTAC instruction, fire support training, targeting analysis), emergency management, operations coordination, or corporate security. JTAC-qualified 13Fs command premium salaries. Your transition timeline is 6-12 months with strategic planning. Start 9-12 months before ETS.

## Resume Translation: Fire Support Skills to Civilian Language

**Instead of:** "13F Fire Support Specialist"
**Write:** "Operations coordinator with expertise in multi-domain coordination, intelligence analysis, target identification, tactical communications, and crisis decision-making in high-threat environments"

**Instead of:** "Coordinated close air support missions"
**Write:** "Coordinated aviation assets executing precision missions; managed air-ground communications, airspace deconfliction, and risk assessment for time-sensitive operations"

**Instead of:** "JTAC-Qualified"
**Write:** "Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC): Controlled close air support aircraft executing precision strikes; cleared aircraft to engage targets; managed airspace and communications coordinating pilots, ground forces, and fire support assets"

**Instead of:** "Identified and analyzed targets"
**Write:** "Conducted intelligence analysis identifying high-value targets; analyzed imagery and terrain; integrated multi-source intelligence to support tactical operations"

**Instead of:** "Called for fire missions"
**Write:** "Coordinated precision fires across artillery, mortars, and air assets; calculated targeting data; communicated with fire direction centers ensuring mission success while preventing collateral damage"

**Instead of:** "Operated targeting systems"
**Write:** "Operated advanced targeting systems including laser rangefinders and GPS; provided precision coordinates for air and artillery strikes; maintained situational awareness across complex battlespace"

**Quantify Everything:**
- "Coordinated 200+ fire missions integrating artillery, mortars, and close air support with zero friendly fire incidents"
- "Conducted target analysis identifying 50+ high-value targets enabling successful operations"
- "If JTAC: Controlled 100+ close air support missions coordinating fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, and armed drones"
- "Trained 15 personnel on fire support operations and targeting procedures"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not Emphasizing JTAC Qualification:** If JTAC-qualified, lead with this—worth $30K-$80K in contractor salaries
2. **Not Maintaining Clearance:** If you have clearance, keep it active—worth $20K-$40K salary premium
3. **Limiting Yourself to "Fire Support" Jobs:** Your skills transfer to intel, LE, operations, emergency management
4. **Not Getting Bachelor's Degree:** Required for intel analyst and federal LE—use GI Bill
5. **Waiting Too Late:** Federal hiring (FBI, intel agencies) takes 12-18 months. Apply early.
6. **Not Networking:** Connect with FiSTers and JTACs who transitioned—they'll help
7. **Underselling Coordination Skills:** You coordinated across air, artillery, and ground—emphasize multi-domain coordination
8. **Not Considering Emergency Management:** Your coordination skills are perfect for 911/emergency operations
