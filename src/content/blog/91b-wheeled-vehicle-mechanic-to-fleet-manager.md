**Mistake #2:** Not learning the business side. Fleet management requires understanding costs, budgets, and efficiency metrics, not just mechanics. Learn the financial side.

**Mistake #3:** Staying in hands-on supervisor role too long. After 3-5 years as supervisor, pursue management track if you want advancement and higher pay.

**Mistake #4:** Ignoring education. Bachelor's degree increasingly required for director/VP roles. Start pursuing it early (GI Bill available).

**Mistake #5:** Limiting geographic search. Fleet operations exists everywhere. Look nationwide for best opportunities and highest pay.
