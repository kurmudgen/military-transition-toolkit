# VA Disability Rating for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Irritable Bowel Syndrome is rated under **Diagnostic Code 7319** with ratings of **0%, 10%, or 30%**. Most veterans receive **10-30%** depending on symptom severity. IBS is very commonly claimed as **secondary** to PTSD, anxiety, or depression (the gut-brain connection is well-established). It's also a **Gulf War presumptive** condition. The key is documenting **symptom frequency** and **impact on daily life**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is IBS and How Does Military Service Cause It?

IBS is a chronic disorder affecting the large intestine, causing abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, and changes in bowel habits.

**Symptoms:**
- Abdominal pain and cramping
- Bloating and gas
- Diarrhea, constipation, or alternating both
- Mucus in stool
- Urgency
- Incomplete evacuation feeling

**Types:**
- IBS-D: Diarrhea predominant
- IBS-C: Constipation predominant
- IBS-M: Mixed

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Onset during service
- Infectious gastroenteritis during deployment triggering IBS
- Stress-related onset

**Gulf War presumptive:**
IBS is recognized as a Gulf War presumptive condition under 38 CFR § 3.317 for veterans who served in Southwest Asia.

**Secondary service connection:**
- **PTSD**: Strong gut-brain connection
- **Anxiety/depression**: Stress affects gut function
- **Medications**: Side effects of service-connected condition treatments

## VA Rating Criteria

IBS is rated under **38 CFR § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319** (irritable colon syndrome):

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mild; disturbances of bowel function with occasional episodes of abdominal distress |
| **10%** | Moderate; frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress |
| **30%** | Severe; diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress |

### Rating Factors

- **Frequency**: How often symptoms occur
- **Constancy**: More constant = higher rating
- **Abdominal distress**: Pain, cramping, bloating
- **Impact**: Effect on daily activities

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing GI complaints
- Documentation of service in Southwest Asia (for presumptive)
- Evidence supporting secondary connection to mental health condition

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

- Diagnosis meeting Rome criteria

### Severity Evidence
- Symptom diary documenting frequency
- Treatment records
- Medications tried
- Impact on daily activities

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Ask about symptom frequency and severity
3. Review test results
4. Assess impact on daily life

**What to tell them:**
- How often you have episodes
- Describe abdominal distress
- Impact on work and activities
- Medications and effectiveness

**Keep a symptom diary** documenting episodes, foods, stress triggers, and severity.

## Secondary Conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is IBS presumptive for Gulf War veterans?
Yes. If you served in Southwest Asia and have IBS that manifested by December 31, 2026, it's presumptively service-connected.

### Can I claim IBS secondary to PTSD?
Yes. The gut-brain connection is well-established. Stress and PTSD significantly affect gut function.

### What's the difference between 10% and 30%?
10% is for frequent episodes of bowel disturbance. 30% requires more constant abdominal distress with diarrhea or alternating symptoms.

### Do I need a colonoscopy for IBS claim?
Not necessarily, but having tests that rule out other conditions (like inflammatory bowel disease) strengthens your diagnosis.
