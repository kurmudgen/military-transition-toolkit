# Military Spouse to Teletherapy Counselor: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Teletherapy allows licensed counselors to practice from anywhere—making it one of the most **PCS-proof professional careers** for military spouses. Salaries range from **$50,000-$90,000** with flexible hours. The catch: it requires a **master's degree** (2-3 years), **supervised clinical hours** (2,000-4,000), and state licensure. However, **PSYPACT** now allows psychologists to practice across 40+ states, and similar compacts are developing for counselors. If you're passionate about mental health and willing to invest in education, teletherapy offers career stability that few professions can match.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Mental health professionals have faced the same licensing nightmare as nurses and teachers—every state has different requirements, and moving meant starting over. A fully licensed therapist in one state might need another 1-2 years of supervision in the next.

But the mental health field is evolving rapidly:
- **Teletherapy became mainstream** during COVID and isn't going away
- **PSYPACT** (for psychologists) created multi-state practice
- **Counseling Compact** is in development for LPCs/LMFTs
- **Military spouse expedited licensing** exists in most states
- **Online group practices** hire remote therapists across states

The investment is significant—but the payoff is a career that finally moves with you.

## Success Stories

**Dr. Sarah, Army Spouse - PSYPACT Psychologist**
"I got my PsyD knowing it was a long road—seven years total. But now I'm fully licensed and PSYPACT-certified. When we moved from Georgia to Texas last year, I kept seeing my Georgia clients via telehealth while getting licensed in Texas. Zero income disruption. My Texas application took 6 weeks with military spouse expedited processing. Now I practice across 12 states and make $120K working from my home office."

**Marcus, Marine Corps Spouse - Telehealth LMFT**
"The post-master's hours were brutal—I was at 1,800 hours when we got orders to Camp Pendleton. In the old days, California might not have accepted my Virginia hours. But with military spouse expedited licensing and my meticulous documentation, California accepted all my hours. I finished my last 200 hours in San Diego and got licensed. Now I work for a telehealth group practice and see clients in six states."

**Angela, Air Force Spouse - School Counselor**
"Traditional school counseling meant starting over each PCS. I pivoted to telehealth school counseling through Presence Learning. Now I provide counseling to students in Colorado while living in Germany. The time zone is challenging—I work 3pm-9pm local time—but I have the same job, same students, same income. When we PCS to Florida, nothing changes."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "A master's degree takes too long—we'll PCS"
**Solution:** CACREP-accredited online programs allow you to continue coursework anywhere. Choose programs with clinical placement networks. Time intensive clinical portions for stable duty stations. Many military spouses complete degrees across 2-3 duty stations.

### "Supervised hours don't transfer between states"
**Solution:** This is less true than it used to be. Most states accept hours from other states if properly documented. Get supervision from someone licensed in multiple states when possible. Keep immaculate records (hours, dates, supervisor credentials, activities).

### "I can't afford graduate school"
**Solution:** Public universities offer in-state tuition for military families. GI Bill transfer covers most costs. Work part-time during the degree (many sites pay supervisees). Income-based loan repayment makes debt manageable.

### "What about OCONUS assignments?"
**Solution:** PSYPACT doesn't apply internationally, but: You can see US-based clients via telehealth (client's location determines jurisdiction). Some OCONUS positions (DODEA, military hospitals) hire licensed counselors. Contract work for military families may be available.

### "There's a mental health shortage—why is this so hard?"
**Solution:** Licensing requirements exist to protect clients, but they're becoming more flexible. The counseling compact will help tremendously. In the meantime, work for multi-state group practices that handle credentialing.

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Explore and Commit
- **Week 1:** Research degree options. Contact 3-5 CACREP programs about military spouse policies, clinical placement, and PCS accommodations.
- **Week 2:** Shadow a therapist if possible. Confirm this career matches your personality and goals.
- **Week 3:** Calculate costs. Apply for GI Bill transfer if applicable. Research scholarships and assistantships.
- **Week 4:** Apply to programs (most have rolling admission). Complete prerequisite courses if needed.

### Days 31-60: Program Preparation
- **Week 5-6:** Accept program admission. Plan coursework around anticipated PCS timeline.
- **Week 7-8:** Begin coursework OR complete prerequisites. Join AAMFT or ACA student membership.

### Days 61-90: Build Foundation
- **Week 9-10:** Progress in coursework. Research practicum sites for upcoming clinical hours.
- **Week 11-12:** Connect with military spouse therapist groups. Plan clinical placement timing around duty station.
