# Government Contracting 101 for Veterans: Complete Guide

The federal government doesn't build its own fighter jets, write its own software, or run all its own facilities. It contracts out. And the companies doing this work—government contractors—need people who understand the mission, hold security clearances, and can navigate federal environments.

That's you.

Government contracting represents one of the largest employment sectors for veterans. Your clearance, your understanding of military operations, and your mission-focused mindset make you exactly what these companies seek.

## What is Government Contracting?

### The Basic Model

The federal government contracts with private companies to:
- Provide goods and services
- Develop technology
- Support operations
- Augment federal workforce
- Deliver specialized expertise

### Why Contractors?
