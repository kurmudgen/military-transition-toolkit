- NY (upstate), PA (cities), RI

**Low Cost:**

## 11. ACTION PLAN: CLAIMING YOUR BENEFITS

### **90-DAY ACTION PLAN**

**DAYS 1-30: RESEARCH & RESIDENCY**

□ Verify your VA disability rating (get letter from VA.gov)
□ Obtain DD-214 (need certified copy for most benefits)
□ Establish state residency:
  - Get driver's license
  - Register to vote
  - Update vehicle registration
□ Research county/city-specific benefits in target area
□ Contact state veterans affairs office

**DAYS 31-60: APPLY FOR PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS**

□ Visit local tax assessor's office (city/town/county)
□ Bring required documents:
  - DD-214
  - VA disability letter
  - Proof of residency
  - Property deed
□ Complete property tax exemption application
□ Submit before deadline (varies by state, often March-April for next tax year)
□ Get confirmation of filing

**DAYS 61-90: APPLY FOR OTHER BENEFITS**

□ File for income tax exemptions on state return
□ Apply for education benefits (if applicable):
  - NY: Veterans Tuition Award through HESC
  - MA: Tuition waiver through college financial aid office
  - Other states: Contact state veterans office
□ Get free veteran license plates (if offered)
□ Apply for hunting/fishing licenses (if 100% disabled)
□ Register with state veterans office for updates on new benefits

**ONGOING:**

□ File property tax exemption renewal (if required - some states annual, some one-time)
□ Update VA if disability rating changes (higher rating = more benefits)
□ Check for new state benefits annually
□ Join local veterans organizations for benefit updates

### **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**

❌ Not filing property tax exemption by deadline (you'll miss entire year)
❌ Assuming benefits automatically apply (you must apply for almost everything)
❌ Forgetting to bring certified DD-214 (regular copy often not accepted)
❌ Not checking county/city benefits (some localities offer extra exemptions)
❌ Failing to renew annual exemptions (some states require yearly filing)
