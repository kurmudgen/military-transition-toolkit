# C&P Exam for Knee Conditions: Complete Preparation Guide (2025)

Knee conditions are among the most common VA disability claims, and your C&P exam will largely determine your rating. Understanding how the VA evaluates knees—including range of motion, instability, and functional limitations—can help you get the rating you deserve.

This guide covers everything you need to know about the knee C&P exam.

## How the VA Rates Knee Conditions

The VA can rate your knee under multiple diagnostic codes, and you can receive ratings under more than one code for the same knee.

### Limitation of Flexion (DC 5260)

How far you can bend your knee:

| Flexion Limited To | Rating |
|-------------------|--------|
| 60° | 0% |
| 45° | 10% |
| 30° | 20% |
| 15° | 30% |

**Normal flexion**: 140°

### Limitation of Extension (DC 5261)

How far you can straighten your knee:

| Extension Limited To | Rating |
|---------------------|--------|
| 5° | 0% |
| 10° | 10% |
| 15° | 20% |
| 20° | 30% |
| 30° | 40% |
| 45° | 50% |

**Normal extension**: 0° (fully straight)

### Instability (DC 5257)

If your knee gives out or feels unstable:

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Slight | 10% |
| Moderate | 20% |
| Severe | 30% |

**Important**: You can receive separate ratings for limitation of motion AND instability on the same knee.

### Cartilage/Meniscus Conditions

**DC 5258** - Dislocated meniscus with frequent locking, pain, and effusion: **20%**

**DC 5259** - Removed meniscus, symptomatic: **10%**

### Knee Replacement (DC 5055)

| Status | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| 1 year following replacement | 100% |
| With chronic residuals | 60% |
| With intermediate degrees | 30% |
| Minimum rating | 30% |

### Ankylosis (DC 5256)

If your knee is fused/immovable:
- Favorable angle: 30%
- Full extension to slight flexion: 40%
- Unfavorable angle: 50-60%

## The Bilateral Factor

If both knees are service-connected, the VA adds the **bilateral factor**—a 10% increase to the combined value of paired extremity disabilities.

**Example:**
- Right knee limitation of flexion: 10%
- Left knee limitation of extension: 10%
- Combined before bilateral factor: 19%
- After bilateral factor: 19% + 1.9% = 20.9% → rounds to 21%

## What Happens During the Exam

### History and Symptoms

The examiner asks about:
- How/when your knee condition started
- Current symptoms (pain, swelling, giving way)
- Treatment history (surgery, injections, physical therapy)
- Impact on daily activities and work
- Flare-ups

### Range of Motion Testing

You'll be asked to:
1. **Bend your knee** (flexion) - Bring heel toward buttock
2. **Straighten your knee** (extension) - Fully extend leg
3. **Repeat 3 times** - Testing for fatigue and pain

The examiner uses a goniometer to measure angles.

**They measure:**
- Active ROM (you move)
- Passive ROM (examiner moves your leg)
- After repetitive use (3 reps, then remeasure)

### Stability Testing

The examiner tests for instability by:
- **Varus/valgus stress test**: Pushing knee sideways to check ligaments
- **Anterior/posterior drawer test**: Pushing lower leg forward/backward (ACL/PCL)
- **Lachman test**: Similar to drawer test, different position
- **McMurray test**: Rotating knee for meniscus issues

### Other Evaluations

- Checking for swelling (effusion)
- Feeling for warmth
- Assessing muscle strength
- Observing gait (how you walk)
- Checking for crepitus (grinding sensation)

## The DeLuca Factors

Under **DeLuca v. Brown**, the VA must consider functional loss:
- Pain on movement
- Weakened movement
- Fatigability
- Incoordination
- Flare-ups

### How This Affects Your Rating

If your physical ROM is 100° flexion, but pain starts at 60°, your functional limitation is 60°—potentially a 10% rating instead of 0%.

**Tell the examiner where pain begins, not just where motion ends.**

## Flare-Ups: Don't Forget to Mention Them

### What the Examiner Should Document

- How often flare-ups occur
- How long they last
- Severity compared to baseline
- What triggers them
- Functional limitations during flare-ups

### What to Say

"I have flare-ups about twice a week, usually after walking more than a mile. During a flare-up, my knee swells and I can barely bend it—maybe to 30 degrees. Today is actually a pretty good day for me."

## Getting Multiple Ratings for One Knee

The VA can rate the same knee under multiple codes:

### Example: Knee with Arthritis + Instability

- Limitation of flexion (10%): Painful motion limits flexion
- Instability (10%): Knee gives out occasionally
- **Combined for one knee: 19%**

### Example: Knee with Cartilage Damage + Limited Motion

- Removed meniscus, symptomatic (10%)
- Limitation of extension (10%)
- **Combined for one knee: 19%**

### VAOPGCPREC 23-97 and 9-98

These VA General Counsel opinions establish that separate ratings for instability and limitation of motion on the same knee are permissible.

If you have both, make sure the examiner documents both.

## How to Prepare

### Before the Exam

**1. List all symptoms:**
- Pain (when, where, severity)
- Swelling
- Giving way/instability
- Locking
- Grinding
- Stiffness
- Weakness

**2. Document flare-ups:**
- Frequency
- Duration
- Triggers
- Severity
- What you can't do during flare-ups

**3. Note functional limitations:**
- Can't kneel
- Can't squat
- Limited walking distance
- Can't use stairs without rail
- Can't stand for long periods

**4. Prepare specific examples:**
- "I fell twice last month when my knee gave out"
- "I can't play with my kids on the floor"
- "I have to use the elevator at work because stairs are too painful"

### What to Bring

- Photo ID
- List of medications
- List of symptoms and limitations
- Knee brace if you use one
- Cane/walking device if you use one
- Notes on flare-ups

### Day of the Exam

**Don't take extra pain medication.**
You want the examiner to see your normal condition.

**Bring your brace/assistive device.**
Even if you don't always use it, bring it to show the examiner.

**Wear shorts or loose pants.**
The examiner needs to see and manipulate your knee.

## During the Exam: Tips

### Stop Movement When Pain Starts

Don't push through severe pain. The examiner should note where pain limits motion.

**Examiner**: "Bend your knee as far as you can."
**You**: [Bending] "This is where the pain becomes significant." [Stop at 90°]

### Describe Instability Symptoms

If your knee gives out:
- "My knee buckles about once a week when I'm walking"
- "I don't trust it on stairs"
- "I've fallen because my knee gave out"

### Mention All Symptoms

- "There's grinding when I bend it"
- "It swells after activity"
- "It locks up sometimes and I have to wiggle it to unlock"

### Talk About Your Worst Days

"Today is about a 4 out of 10. On my worst days, I can barely walk and the pain is an 8 or 9."

### Describe Functional Impact

- "I can only walk about half a mile before the pain is too much"
- "I can't kneel at all"
- "I have to sit on a stool to take a shower because I can't stand that long"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Pushing Through Pain

Don't bend your knee to maximum physical capability. Stop where significant pain begins.

### 2. Not Mentioning Instability

If your knee gives way, say so. Instability can be rated separately from ROM.

### 3. Forgetting Flare-Ups

The examiner should estimate your ROM during flare-ups. Bring this up.

### 4. Minimizing Symptoms

"It's not too bad" hurts your claim. Be honest about your actual limitations.

### 5. Not Bringing Assistive Devices

If you use a brace or cane sometimes, bring it. Even occasional use shows the severity.

### 6. Appearing Better Than Usual

If the exam day is unusually good, tell the examiner. "Today I feel better than normal."

## After the Exam

### What Happens Next

The examiner completes a DBQ sent to the VA rating authority. You'll receive a decision in 2-8 weeks typically.

### Review the DBQ

Request a copy of the completed DBQ through your VA records. Check for accuracy:
- Are ROM measurements correct?
- Are flare-ups documented?
- Is instability noted if present?
- Are all symptoms captured?

### If You Disagree

- **Supplemental Claim**: Add new evidence
- **Higher Level Review**: Request senior review for errors
- **Board Appeal**: Formal appeal

## Secondary Conditions to Consider

Your knee condition may cause or contribute to:

### Opposite Knee
Favoring one knee stresses the other.

### Hip Problems
Altered gait affects hip.

### Back Pain
Limping changes spinal alignment.

### Depression/Anxiety
Chronic pain affects mental health.

### Obesity
Can't exercise leads to weight gain.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get separate ratings for both ROM and instability?

Yes. Under VAOPGCPREC 23-97, you can receive separate ratings for limitation of motion (arthritis) and instability on the same knee.

### What if I've had knee surgery?

You're rated based on residuals. For knee replacement, you get 100% for one year, then re-evaluated.

### Do I need an MRI for the exam?

The examiner will rely on imaging already in your file. If you have recent MRI results showing damage, make sure they're in your records.

### What if my pain is worse after the exam from all the movement?

This is common and actually demonstrates your condition. Note it for any future appeals.

### Can I claim both knees?

Yes. Each knee is rated separately, and you get the bilateral factor.

### What about crepitus (grinding)?

Mention it. Crepitus indicates cartilage damage and supports your diagnosis.

## 2025 Example Ratings

**Veteran with right knee DJD:**
- Flexion limited to 45° due to pain: 10% (DC 5260)
- Extension limited to 10° due to pain: 10% (DC 5261)
- Slight instability: 10% (DC 5257)
- Combined for right knee: 27%

**Veteran with bilateral knee conditions:**
- Right knee limitation: 20%
- Left knee limitation: 10%
- Combined with bilateral factor: 28% + 2.8% = ~31%

## Bottom Line

The knee C&P exam evaluates range of motion, instability, and functional limitations. You may qualify for multiple ratings on the same knee if you have both limited motion and instability.

Key takeaways:
- Stop movement where pain begins, not maximum physical capability
- Mention instability symptoms (giving way, buckling)
- Document and describe flare-ups
- Bring assistive devices you use
- Don't minimize—be honest about your actual limitations

Your rating depends on this exam. Prepare thoroughly.
