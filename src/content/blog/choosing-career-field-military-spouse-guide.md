# How to Choose a Career Field as a Military Spouse: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Choosing the right career field is the most important decision for military spouse employment success. The best careers combine **portability** (works at any duty station), **flexibility** (accommodates military chaos), and **growth potential** (builds over time despite moves). This guide provides a framework to evaluate your options, identify your strengths, and select a career that works with military life rather than against it.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

The average military family PCSes every **2-3 years**. For civilian careers, this means:
- Constant job hunting and interview anxiety
- Restarting at entry-level positions
- Losing professional networks
- Income instability
- Explaining resume gaps repeatedly

**The solution isn't finding a job—it's choosing a career field where these challenges matter less.**

Portable, flexible, remote-friendly careers transform PCS from career disaster to minor scheduling inconvenience.

## Career Selection Framework

### The Four Portability Factors

Rate potential careers on each factor (1-5 scale):

**1. Location Independence**
- Can you do this job from anywhere?
- Is the work primarily remote/virtual?
- Does it require physical presence?

5 = Fully remote (software developer, writer)
3 = Hybrid possible (project manager, consultant)
1 = Location-dependent (restaurant manager, physical therapist)

**2. License Portability**
- Do you need state-specific licensure?
- How easy is interstate transfer?
- Are there compact agreements?

5 = No license needed (marketing, IT support)
3 = Compact license available (nursing, psychology)
1 = State-by-state relicensure (teaching, law)

**3. Employment Availability**
- Are jobs available at most duty stations?
- What about rural or OCONUS locations?
- Is remote hiring common?

5 = Jobs everywhere or fully remote (accounting, tech)
3 = Jobs at medium+ installations (healthcare admin)
1 = Jobs only in major metros (fashion, entertainment)

**4. Career Continuity**
- Can you maintain relationships/reputation across moves?
- Does experience compound or reset?
- Is advancement based on skills or tenure?

5 = Reputation and skills travel (consulting, freelancing)
3 = Experience counts, some restart (corporate jobs)
1 = Tenure-based, resets each move (retail management)

### Portability Score

Add your ratings for each factor. Total possible: 20.

| Score | Portability Level | Examples |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 17-20 | Excellent | Remote tech, freelancing, virtual services |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Portability

**Problem:** Choosing career based only on interest without considering military life realities.

**Example:** Becoming a licensed therapist in California, then PCSing to Texas where your license doesn't transfer and you need 6+ months to relicense.

**Solution:** Weight portability heavily in your decision. Interest + portability = sustainable career.

### Mistake 2: Overvaluing Short-Term Income

**Problem:** Taking any available job rather than building toward portable career.

**Example:** Working retail at each duty station because it's "available," despite never advancing and earning minimum wage indefinitely.

**Solution:** Invest in training for portable career. Short-term sacrifice for long-term gains.

### Mistake 3: Not Considering Remote Work

**Problem:** Assuming all work must be local/in-person.

**Example:** Only applying for office jobs near the installation when remote positions in your field exist nationwide.

**Solution:** Actively seek remote work. Many employers now offer remote positions that simply weren't available before.

### Mistake 4: Waiting for "Stable" to Start

**Problem:** Waiting for a longer duty station or spouse retirement to build career.

**Example:** Telling yourself you'll "figure it out" after your spouse's 20 years, then having no career foundation at 45.

**Solution:** Start now. Every year of building is an advantage. Even 2 years somewhere = progress.

### Mistake 5: Not Leveraging Military Spouse Identity

**Problem:** Hiding military spouse status, missing spouse-specific opportunities.

**Example:** Not applying for military spouse hiring preference, scholarships, or MSEP partner companies.

**Solution:** Use your military spouse status. Many employers specifically want military spouses for their adaptability and work ethic.
