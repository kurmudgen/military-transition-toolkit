# Delaware Veterans: Healthcare Facilities, Education Benefits & Job Resources

Delaware is home to approximately 61,454 veterans—representing 7.5% of the state's population. Despite being the second-smallest state in America (only Rhode Island is smaller), Delaware packs substantial veteran infrastructure into its 96-mile north-to-south span.

With a full VA medical center in Wilmington, community-based clinics strategically placed across all three counties, Dover Air Force Base as a major employer, and zero sales tax making every dollar stretch further, Delaware offers veterans a unique proposition: Mid-Atlantic location without Mid-Atlantic costs.

This guide provides actual addresses, phone numbers, and actionable information for Delaware veterans navigating healthcare, education, and employment.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Healthcare**: 1 VA medical center (Wilmington), 3 community-based outpatient clinics (Dover, Georgetown, plus mobile units), 1 state veterans home (Milford) - comprehensive coverage for a small state

**Education**: In-state tuition for GI Bill users at University of Delaware and Delaware State University; limited Yellow Ribbon participation; strong regional university options

**Employment**: Dover Air Force Base (major employer), state hiring preference (5-10 points), proximity to Philadelphia/Baltimore/DC job markets, limited defense contractor presence in-state

**Veteran Population**: ~61,454 veterans (7.5% of population), concentrated in New Castle County (Wilmington area) and Kent County (Dover area)

**Biggest advantage**: Small state means nowhere is more than 90 minutes from VA care; strategic location provides access to major metro job markets while living in lower-cost Delaware

**Key challenge**: Limited in-state employment options compared to larger states; many Delaware veterans commute to Philadelphia, Baltimore, or DC for work

## VA Healthcare Facilities in Delaware

Delaware's compact size works in veterans' favor—no veteran lives more than 60 miles from VA care.

**Best practices**:
- Enroll immediately upon separation, even if you don't need care yet
- Use VA's online scheduling tools or mobile app

- Three clinic locations mean you can often find earlier appointments by trying different sites

**Community Care**: VA authorizes community care at civilian providers if:
- Wait time exceeds 30 days

- VA doesn't offer needed service

Given Delaware's proximity to excellent Philadelphia and Baltimore medical facilities, community care authorization provides access to world-class civilian healthcare when needed.

- **VA Medical Center**: Wilmington (full-service hospital)
- **Major employers**: Financial services (Wilmington), University of Delaware (Newark), commuters to Philadelphia
- **Housing costs**: Highest in state; median ~$295,000-$390,000 depending on area
- **Advantage**: Closest to Philadelphia jobs; best VA access

### Kent County (Dover)

- **Major employers**: Dover AFB, state government, Bayhealth hospital
- **Housing costs**: Moderate; median ~$262,000-$335,000

### Sussex County (Georgetown, Lewes, Rehoboth Beach)

- **Veteran population**: ~13,000-16,000
- **VA Clinic**: Georgetown CBOC
- **Economy**: Tourism, agriculture, retirees, beach communities
- **Housing costs**: Variable—Georgetown affordable (~$280,000), beach towns expensive ($500,000-$1,000,000+)
- **Advantage**: Beach lifestyle; lower cost of living in western Sussex County; popular with retirees

## Key Takeaways

1. **Delaware's small size is a healthcare advantage** - No veteran lives more than 60 miles from VA care; three strategically placed clinics cover entire state

2. **Dover AFB provides federal employment stability** - 3,500+ civilian jobs with veterans' preference; ideal for transitioning Air Force personnel

3. **In-state tuition for GI Bill users saves $10,000-$15,000/year** - University of Delaware and Delaware State both comply; Delaware Tech extremely affordable

4. **State hiring preference provides real advantage** - 5-10 point boost on state job applications; Delaware state government employs 14,000+

5. **Commuting to Philadelphia or Baltimore expands opportunities** - Live in Delaware (lower taxes/costs), work in higher-wage markets; common strategy

6. **Limited defense contractor presence in-state** - Unlike Virginia or Maryland, few defense contractors have Delaware operations; must commute to access that industry

7. **Zero sales tax amplifies every paycheck** - Makes Delaware particularly attractive for those commuting to higher-tax states for work

8. **Delaware Veterans Home in Milford provides quality long-term care** - State-operated facility with good reputation; centrally located

9. **Small veteran population means personalized service** - ~61,000 veterans vs. California's 1.6 million; easier to access VSOs and veteran services

Delaware won't work for everyone—it's a small state with limited geographic diversity and fewer in-state job options than larger states. But for veterans who value Mid-Atlantic location, low taxes, beach access, and proximity to major metros while living in a lower-cost environment, Delaware delivers.
