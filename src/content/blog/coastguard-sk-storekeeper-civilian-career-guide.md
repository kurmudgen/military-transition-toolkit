## Bottom Line Up Front

Coast Guard Storekeepers have **logistics, procurement, and supply chain management skills** that translate directly to civilian careers in supply chain management, purchasing, inventory control, and logistics coordination. Your experience managing Coast Guard supply operations, procurement contracts, inventory systems, and financial accountability makes you a solid candidate for civilian logistics roles. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$65,000** for entry-level positions, with experienced supply chain professionals hitting **$75,000-$95,000+** and senior logistics managers reaching **$95,000-$125,000+**. APICS certifications can boost salaries 20-40%. The supply chain industry faces massive worker shortages. You're walking into high demand.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every Coast Guard SK transitioning out wonders: "Do my supply skills translate to civilian logistics jobs?"

Here's the answer: **Absolutely yes—civilian supply chain is exactly what you've been doing.**

What you did in the Guard:
- Managed procurement of supplies, parts, equipment for Coast Guard units
- Tracked inventory using automated systems
- Processed purchase requisitions and contracts
- Managed accounting and financial records for supplies
- Coordinated shipping, receiving, and material handling
- Maintained accountability for government property worth millions
- Used Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems
- Negotiated with vendors and suppliers
- Completed 8-week SK "A" School (procurement, inventory management, accounting, records)

That's **exactly** what civilian supply chain specialists, buyers, inventory managers, and logistics coordinators do daily.

The gap? Civilian employers want **APICS certifications** (CSCP, CPIM) and specific software experience (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics). Your SK experience proves you can do the work. Certifications prove it on paper.
