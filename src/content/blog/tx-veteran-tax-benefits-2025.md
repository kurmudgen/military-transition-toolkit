# Texas Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Texas offers some of the nation's best veteran tax benefits, anchored by having **no state income tax** (saving military retirees $2,000-$6,000+ annually) and a **full property tax exemption** for 100% disabled veterans with no cap or limit. A 100% P&T disabled veteran with a $400,000 home in Dallas saves $6,200+ annually in property taxes, plus $4,000+ in eliminated state income taxes, totaling over $10,000 in annual savings.

Texas ranks in the **top 5 states nationally** for veteran tax benefits. The combination of zero income tax, full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans (worth $5,000-$12,000+ annually depending on location), partial exemptions starting at 10% disability ($5,000-$24,000 based on rating and age), and reduced vehicle registration fees creates substantial financial advantages.

The property tax structure is graduated: 10-29% disability gets $5,000 exemption; 30-49% gets $7,500; 50-69% gets $10,000; 70-100% gets $12,000. Veterans 65+ with at least 10% disability get an additional $12,000 exemption (maximum $24,000 combined). But the crown jewel: 100% P&T disabled veterans get **complete exemption** of their primary residence—no cap, unlimited value.

Downsides? Texas has relatively high property taxes generally (1.60% effective rate, 7th highest nationally), so if you don't qualify for exemptions, you'll pay substantial property taxes. Also, sales tax is high at 6.25% state (8.25% combined with local). But for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees, the benefits far outweigh these costs.

Overall verdict: Texas is **exceptional** for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees—top 5 nationally. Even veterans with 50%+ disability ratings benefit significantly. Texas has the **largest veteran population in America** (1.54+ million) for good reason.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans (Permanent & Total):**
- Exemption: **100% of assessed property value** (full exemption, no cap, unlimited)
- Requirements: 100% P&T service-connected disability from VA or Individual Unemployability (TDIU); primary residence in Texas
- Annual savings: $5,000-$15,000+ depending on home value and county
- Form: 50-114 (Application for 100% Disabled Veteran Exemption)

If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, your primary residence is completely exempt from property taxes—period. No cap, no income limit, no restrictions. Whether your home is worth $200,000 or $2 million, you pay **zero property tax**.

This is governed by Texas Tax Code Section 11.131 and is one of the most generous property tax benefits in America. Individual Unemployability (TDIU) also qualifies, meaning if you're rated less than 100% but the VA determined you're unemployable due to service-connected disabilities, you get the full exemption.

**Example:** A 100% disabled veteran with a $400,000 home in Dallas County (1.55% effective rate) saves $6,200 annually. Over 30 years, that's $186,000 in tax savings.

**Partial Disability Exemptions (Tax Code Section 11.22):**

Texas offers graduated exemptions for all disabled veterans:

- **10% to 29% disability:** $5,000 exemption from assessed value
- **30% to 49% disability:** $7,500 exemption
- **50% to 69% disability:** $10,000 exemption
- **70% to 100% disability:** $12,000 exemption

**Important:** These dollar amounts are deducted from your home's assessed value before taxes are calculated.

**Additional Exemption for Age 65+:**

Disabled veterans who are 65 years or older with a disability rating of **at least 10%** receive an additional $12,000 exemption. This stacks with the disability exemption above.

**Maximum for seniors:** A 70%+ disabled veteran age 65+ gets $12,000 (disability) + $12,000 (age 65+) = **$24,000 total exemption**.

**Calculation Example (70% disabled, age 67, Harris County):**

- Home assessed value: $350,000
- Total exemption: $24,000
- Taxable value: $326,000
- Effective tax rate: 1.49%
- Annual tax: $4,857 (vs. $5,215 without exemption)
- **Annual savings: $358**

While $358 seems modest, remember this applies to those under 100% P&T. If you're 100% P&T, you pay zero regardless of age.

**General Veteran Homestead Exemption:**

All honorably discharged Texas veterans qualify for an additional **$12,000 homestead exemption** from their school district taxes, even with 0% disability. This applies on top of the standard Texas homestead exemption.

### How to Apply

**Application Process:**

1. **Determine which exemption you qualify for:**
   - 100% P&T: Form 50-114
   - Partial disability (10-100%): Form 50-135
   - Both available at county appraisal district

2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
   - VA award letter showing disability rating and P&T status (for 100% exemption) or percentage (for partial)
   - Texas driver's license or ID matching property address
   - Property deed or tax statement

3. **File application with your county appraisal district:**
   - Find your county: Search "[County name] appraisal district Texas"
   - Deadline: **April 30** of the tax year
   - Can file up to 5 years retroactively if you miss the deadline

4. **Processing:**
   - Processing: 30-60 days
   - Effective: Current tax year if filed by April 30
   - Renewal: Typically automatic once approved for 100% P&T; may require periodic recertification for partial disability

**Important:** Once approved for the 100% disabled exemption, it typically renews automatically. However, if you move to a different county, you must reapply with that county's appraisal district.

### Property Tax by County (Major Cities)

Texas property taxes are assessed at the county level with significant variation. Here's what 100% disabled veterans save:

| County (City) | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Savings (100% Disabled) |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Travis (Austin) | $499,000 | 1.64% | $8,184 | $8,184 |
| Dallas (Dallas) | $439,999 | 1.55% | $6,820 | $6,820 |
| Harris (Houston) | $370,990 | 1.49% | $5,528 | $5,528 |
| Tarrant (Fort Worth) | $360,000 | 1.52% | $5,472 | $5,472 |
| Bexar (San Antonio) | $335,000 | 1.82% | $6,097 | $6,097 |
| El Paso (El Paso) | $245,000 | 1.78% | $4,361 | $4,361 |
| Bell (Killeen/Fort Cavazos) | $268,000 | 1.85% | $4,958 | $4,958 |

**Over 20 years**, a 100% disabled veteran in Austin saves **$163,680** in property taxes. In Dallas: **$136,400**. In San Antonio: **$121,940**.

### Partial Exemption Savings by Rating

**50% Disabled Veteran (Dallas County, $439,999 home):**
- Exemption: $10,000 from assessed value
- Taxable value: $429,999
- Tax without exemption: $6,820
- Tax with exemption: $6,665
- **Annual savings: $155**

**70% Disabled Veteran, Age 66 (Dallas County, $439,999 home):**
- Exemption: $12,000 (disability) + $12,000 (age 65+) = $24,000
- Taxable value: $415,999
- Tax with exemption: $6,448
- **Annual savings: $372**

While partial exemptions provide modest savings, the real benefit is for 100% P&T disabled veterans who pay **zero** property tax.

### Surviving Spouse Benefits

An unremarried surviving spouse of a 100% disabled veteran can continue receiving the full property tax exemption if:
- Spouse continues to occupy the homestead
- Spouse doesn't remarry
- Property remains the surviving spouse's primary residence

The exemption also transfers if the surviving spouse sells the home and purchases another primary residence in Texas. The new home receives a similar proportional exemption based on the sale proceeds applied to the new property.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—Texas has no state income tax**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $2,000-$6,000+ compared to taxing states

Texas is one of **eight states** with no general income tax (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming). Military retirement pay, civilian wages, Social Security, pensions—all tax-free at the state level.

**Example savings:**

- **O-5 retiree with $60,000 pension:**
  - In California (top rate 9.3%): $5,580 state tax
  - In Texas: $0
  - **Annual savings: $5,580**

- **E-7 retiree with $35,000 pension:**
  - In Virginia (5.75% rate): $2,013 state tax
  - In Texas: $0
  - **Annual savings: $2,013**

- **O-6 retiree with $80,000 pension:**
  - In New York (top rate 8.82%): $7,056 state tax
  - In Texas: $0
  - **Annual savings: $7,056**

Over 20 years of retirement, an E-7 retiree saves **$40,260**. An O-5 saves **$111,600**. An O-6 saves **$141,120**.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt federally and in all states
- Texas: Not taxed

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere. Texas' lack of income tax means you keep every dollar of your VA disability payment.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Texas taxation: $0 (no income tax)
- Federal: Taxed federally

Surviving spouses pay zero Texas state tax on Survivor Benefit Plan payments, saving $1,000-$3,000+ annually compared to states with income tax.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Not subject to Texas state tax (no income tax)
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; Texas doesn't tax it either
- **Active duty pay:** Not taxed by Texas if you maintain out-of-state residency under SCRA
- **401(k)/IRA withdrawals:** Not taxed by Texas
- **Social Security:** Not taxed by Texas

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran License Plates:**

- **Cost for first set:** $3 for plates + **FREE vehicle registration** (vehicles under 18,000 lbs)
- **Eligibility:** At least 50% service-connected disability, OR 40% with lower extremity amputation
- **Annual savings:** $50-$80 (typical registration fees waived)
- **Personalization:** Available for additional $40/year

Texas Transportation Code Section 504.202 allows disabled veterans to register one vehicle for personal use without paying the standard registration fee. Additional vehicles can be registered at normal fees.

**Application:** Complete Form VTR-615 (Application for Disabled Veteran License Plates) and submit to your county tax assessor-collector's office along with VA disability documentation.

**Additional Parking Benefits:**

Disabled veteran plates qualify for:
- Use of disabled parking spaces statewide
- Parking placard (no additional fee for permanent disability)
- Parking meter exemptions in many municipalities (verify locally)

**Driver's License Fee Waiver:**

Veterans with a service-related disability of **at least 60%** qualify for a **free Texas driver's license or ID card**.

- Standard license fee: $33
- Commercial driver's license (CDL): Not included in waiver
- Renewal: Free renewals as long as disability persists

Since 100% P&T disabled veterans exceed 60%, they automatically qualify.

**Application:** Present disability letter from VA showing 60%+ rating at Texas DPS office when applying or renewing.

**Disabled Veteran Designation:**

Veterans who are at least 50% disabled (or 40% with lower extremity amputation) may request a **"DISABLED VETERAN"** designation on their driver's license or ID card. This provides additional recognition and may qualify for local discounts.

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **6.25% state rate**
- Combined (state + local): Typically **8.25%** in major cities
- **No general veteran exemption**

Texas does **not** offer sales tax exemptions for veteran purchases, including vehicle purchases. All residents, including disabled veterans, pay the 6.25% state sales tax plus local rates (typically 2% local, totaling 8.25%).

**Vehicle Purchase Example:**
- $40,000 truck purchase
- Sales tax: $3,300 (8.25%)
- Disabled veteran pays: Full $3,300

**Exception:** Vehicles modified for orthopedic disabilities are exempt from motor vehicle sales tax if used at least 80% of the time to transport or be driven by a person with an orthopedic disability. Requires Form 14-318.

While the lack of sales tax exemption is a downside, the property tax and income tax benefits far outweigh this for most veterans.

## Overall Tax Analysis

- **Total annual savings: $4,455**

Even without disability, military retirees save thousands annually by living in Texas due to no state income tax.

### 30-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled Veteran (Dallas scenario):**
- Annual savings (vs. CA): $11,573
- 30-year total: $347,190
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $227,600

**70% Disabled, Age 67:**
- Annual savings: $2,638
- 30-year total (15 years at 70%, 15 at 100% post-exemption): $79,140
- NPV: $60,400

**Military Retiree (No Disability):**
- Annual savings: $4,455
- 30-year total: $133,650
- NPV: $87,600

Over 30 years of retirement, a 100% disabled veteran saves **$227,600-$347,000** compared to living in high-tax states. That's a brand-new home.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $50K Retirement, $440K Home) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Texas** | Exempt (no income tax) | Full exemption (no cap) | $11,573 (vs. CA) |
| Oklahoma | Fully exempt | Full exemption | $9,200 |
| Arkansas | $6,000 exempt | $350K cap exemption | $7,500 |
| Louisiana | Fully exempt | Full exemption | $10,800 |
| New Mexico | Partially exempt | $4,000 exemption | $5,200 |

**Verdict:** Texas ranks **#1** among neighboring states for combined tax benefits to disabled veterans and military retirees. Only Oklahoma comes close, but Texas has superior employment opportunities and larger veteran community.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** **Top tier**—no income tax (only 8 states)
- **Property tax exemption:** **Top 5 nationally**—full exemption with no cap for 100% P&T is elite (only Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina offer similar)
- **Sales tax:** Average—6.25% state rate is middle of pack
- **Overall ranking:** **Top 5 nationally** for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees

Studies consistently rank Texas in the top 5 states for military retirees and top 3 for disabled veterans. MOAA (Military Officers Association of America), WalletHub, and VA studies all rate Texas highly.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- **100% P&T disabled veterans:** Save $7,000-$12,000+ annually (property tax exemption + no income tax)
- **Military retirees with pensions over $40,000:** Save $2,500-$6,000+ annually on income tax
- **Veterans rated 50%+ with homes under $400,000:** Meaningful property tax relief plus income tax savings
- **Veterans moving from high-tax states:** California, New York, Oregon, Illinois, New Jersey residents see massive savings
- **Veteran families wanting employment:** Texas has strong job market, low veteran unemployment (3.0% vs. 3.9% national avg)

**Less beneficial for:**
- **Veterans rated 0-30% disabled:** Minimal property tax benefit ($5,000-$7,500 exemption)
- **Veterans without military retirement income:** Property tax exemption helps, but no income tax benefit
- **Renters:** Can't access property tax exemption benefits
- **Veterans in expensive housing markets (Austin):** High property taxes eat into savings if not 100% disabled

**Better options:**
- If you're 50-90% disabled and want more property tax relief, consider **Florida** (offers exemptions at lower ratings with higher dollar amounts)
- If you want lower cost of living with similar tax benefits, consider **Oklahoma** (lower housing costs, similar tax structure)

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- Texas estate tax: **None** (repealed 2015)
- Texas inheritance tax: **None**
- Veteran exemptions: N/A (no estate/inheritance taxes)

Texas has no estate or inheritance taxes, making it excellent for estate planning and passing wealth to heirs.

### Property Tax Payment Plans

Texas offers property tax deferral for:
- Veterans age 65+
- Veterans with disabilities (as determined by Social Security)
- Surviving spouses (under certain conditions)

Deferral allows you to postpone property tax payments until property is sold or inherited. Interest accrues at 5% annually, but deferral prevents foreclosure for tax delinquency.

### Homestead Portability

Texas allows 100% disabled veterans to **transfer their exemption** when selling one home and buying another. If you sell your exempt home and purchase a new primary residence within 2 years, the new home receives a proportional exemption.

**Example:** Sell $400,000 home (fully exempt) for $450,000, buy $500,000 home. The new home receives 90% exemption ($450k/$500k = 90%), so you only pay tax on $50,000 of value.

This is **huge** for relocating veterans—your exemption travels with you.

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish Texas residency immediately.** Get a Texas driver's license within 90 days of moving (free if 60%+ disabled), register to vote, update DFAS for military retirement payments.

2. **Apply for property tax exemption immediately—don't wait.** File with your county appraisal district within 30 days of moving. Deadline is April 30, but earlier is better. Missing the deadline costs you a full year of savings ($6,000-$10,000+).

3. **Apply for disabled veteran license plates if you're 50%+ disabled.** Free registration saves $70+/year. File Form VTR-615 with county tax assessor-collector.

4. **Get free driver's license if you're 60%+ disabled.** Visit Texas DPS with VA disability letter. Save $33 every 6 years.

5. **Update DFAS tax withholding.** Stop withholding state income tax if you're coming from another state. Texas has no income tax—keep every dollar.

6. **Document everything.** Keep copies of DD-214, VA award letters, Texas driver's license, property deed, and exemption approval letters. You may need these for verification.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not filing property tax exemption by April 30:** You'll pay full property tax for that year. In Dallas, that's $6,820 lost for a $440K home.

- **Assuming partial disability exemption is worth it alone:** If you're 50% disabled with a $400K home in Dallas, you save only $155/year in property tax. The real benefit is no income tax on military retirement.

- **Not claiming free vehicle registration:** 50%+ disabled veterans get free registration on one vehicle. Don't pay if you qualify.

- **Not updating DFAS after moving:** If you move from California and don't update your address/state, DFAS may continue withholding California state tax. Fix this immediately.

- **Not transferring exemption when moving within Texas:** If you move from Dallas to Austin, reapply for the exemption with Travis County Appraisal District. It doesn't automatically transfer between counties.

- **Forgetting to apply for driver's license fee waiver:** 60%+ disabled veterans qualify for free licenses. Bring VA documentation to Texas DPS.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I pay state income tax on my military retirement in Texas?**

A: No. Texas has no state income tax. Military retirement, wages, pensions, Social Security—nothing is taxed at the state level.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled. Do I qualify for the full property tax exemption?**

A: If you're 100% P&T (Permanent and Total) or TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability), yes—full exemption, no cap. Your entire primary residence is exempt from property taxes.

**Q: I'm 70% disabled. What exemption do I get?**

A: You receive a $12,000 exemption from your home's assessed value. If you're also 65+, you get an additional $12,000 ($24,000 total). This reduces your taxable value before taxes are calculated.

**Q: Can I get the property tax exemption if I'm 50% disabled?**

A: Yes. You receive a $10,000 exemption from assessed value. Not as substantial as the 100% exemption, but it reduces your tax bill by $150-$200 annually depending on your county's rate.

**Q: Does the exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. Only your primary residence (homestead) qualifies.

**Q: I'm 100% P&T. Do I need to reapply every year?**

A: Usually no. Once approved, the exemption typically renews automatically. However, if you move to a different county, you must reapply with that county's appraisal district.

**Q: Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption if I die?**

A: Yes. An unremarried surviving spouse can continue the exemption as long as they occupy the homestead and don't remarry.

**Q: I'm TDIU (rated 70% but 100% unemployable). Do I qualify for the full exemption?**

A: Yes! TDIU qualifies for the full property tax exemption, even though your combined rating is less than 100%.

**Q: Does Texas tax Social Security benefits?**

A: No. Texas has no income tax, so Social Security is not taxed.

**Q: I'm active duty stationed in Texas but my home of record is Florida. Do I pay Texas taxes?**

A: Texas has no income tax anyway, so there's nothing to pay. If Texas had income tax, you'd be protected under SCRA.

**Q: What if I move from one Texas county to another?**

A: You need to reapply for the exemption with your new county's appraisal district. The exemption doesn't automatically transfer between counties, but it is transferable.

**Q: Are there local income taxes in Texas?**

A: No. There are no state or local income taxes in Texas.

**Q: I'm 60% disabled. Can I get a free driver's license?**

A: Yes. Veterans with 60%+ service-connected disability qualify for free Texas driver's licenses and ID cards. Bring your VA disability letter to Texas DPS.

**Q: How much do I save on sales tax living in Texas vs. other states?**

A: Texas doesn't offer veteran sales tax exemptions. All residents pay 6.25% state + ~2% local = 8.25% total sales tax. This is actually slightly higher than national average (7.12%). However, the property and income tax savings far exceed this.

**Q: Can I get both the property tax exemption and free vehicle registration?**

A: Yes, if you qualify for both. 100% P&T qualifies for full property tax exemption. 50%+ disability (or 40% with lower extremity amputation) qualifies for free registration on one vehicle.

**Q: What if I have a 100% VA rating but it's not P&T?**

A: Check if you qualify as TDIU (Individual Unemployability). If you have TDIU, you qualify for the full exemption even if it's not P&T. Otherwise, the exemption requires P&T or specific conditions (TDIU, 100% P&T).

**Q: Can I transfer my Hazlewood Act education benefits to my children?**

A: Yes, through the Hazlewood Legacy Program. But this is a separate education benefit—not a tax benefit. See our Texas education guide for details.

**Q: How does Texas compare to Florida for disabled veteran tax benefits?**

A: Very similar. Both offer no income tax and full exemption for 100% disabled veterans. Florida offers slightly higher exemptions at lower disability ratings (50-90%), but Texas has stronger job market and larger veteran community. Both are top-tier.
