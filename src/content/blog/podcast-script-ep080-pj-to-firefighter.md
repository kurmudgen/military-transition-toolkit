[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

Technical Sergeant Mike Davis spent 12 years as an Air Force Pararescueman (PJ), conducting combat search and rescue missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. He separated in 2023 and within 2 months was hired as a firefighter/paramedic in San Diego making $95,000. His military medical training, rescue experience, and physical fitness made him the ideal candidate for fire departments nationwide.

This is Jacob. Today we're covering Mike's transition from elite special operations medic to municipal firefighter—showing how PJ skills translate directly to fire/EMS careers.
