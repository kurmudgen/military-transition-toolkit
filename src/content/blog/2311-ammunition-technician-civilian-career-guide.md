**Civilian safety regulations:** You know DoD regulations (DoD 6055.09, TB 700-2). Civilian employers follow OSHA, DOT, EPA, and industry-specific regulations. You'll learn on the job, but recognize different regulatory frameworks.

**Business operations:** Military ammunition operations focus on mission support. Civilian employers have profit margins, cost controls, and business metrics. Understand business perspective.

**Computer skills:** If your tech experience is limited to military inventory systems, you need commercial software skills. Most jobs require Microsoft Office, Excel, inventory management software, ERP systems. Take free online courses.

**Civilian communication:** Military radio communication and brevity codes don't translate. Civilian employers want professional email, business writing, and phone communication. Polish your business communication.

**Resume and interviewing:** Translating "2311" for civilian HR requires practice. Use translation table above. Practice explaining ammunition work in safety and logistics terms that civilians understand.

**Networking:** Military assignments come through orders. Civilian jobs require networking, LinkedIn, and self-advocacy. Get comfortable with it.
