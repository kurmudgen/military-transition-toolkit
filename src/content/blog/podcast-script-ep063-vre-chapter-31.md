[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

If you have a service-connected disability that affects your ability to work, VA offers a benefit most veterans don't know about: Chapter 31 Veteran Readiness and Employment - VR&E. This isn't the GI Bill. This is a separate program that pays 100% of tuition at any school with no cap, provides up to $3,355 per month in subsistence allowance, covers books and supplies, and - here's the key - doesn't use up any of your GI Bill entitlement. A 2021 policy change means you can use VR&E for a full degree program AND still have your full 36 months of GI Bill benefits remaining afterward. Over 130,000 veterans currently use VR&E. The program has five tracks: Reemployment with your previous employer, Rapid Access to Employment for quick job placement, Self-Employment to start a business, Employment Through Long-Term Services for career retraining, and Independent Living for those unable to work. The catch: You must have at least a 10% service-connected disability rating and an "employment handicap" - meaning your service-connected condition makes it hard to get or keep a job. But if you qualify, VR&E can pay for a bachelor's degree, master's degree, or vocational training at zero cost, plus housing money while you attend. I'm Jacob, Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're covering exactly what VR&E is, who qualifies, the five service tracks, what benefits you receive, and how it compares to using your GI Bill. This is Veteran Transition Blueprint.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**What is VR&E Chapter 31?**

Veteran Readiness and Employment - VR&E - is a VA program that helps veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment.

**The official name changed:** It used to be called "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment." In 2020, VA renamed it "Veteran Readiness and Employment" to better reflect the program's broader focus. You'll still hear both names, and it's still Chapter 31 of Title 38 - that hasn't changed.

**Why this program exists:** Some veterans have service-connected disabilities that create barriers to employment. You might need retraining for a different career field because your disability prevents you from doing your previous work. You might need accommodations or support services. You might need education to develop skills compatible with your current abilities. VR&E provides all of this.

**Key difference from GI Bill:** GI Bill is an education benefit available to all eligible veterans. VR&E is a rehabilitation program specifically for veterans with service-connected disabilities that affect employability. GI Bill pays for school. VR&E provides comprehensive support to achieve employment - which might include education, but also counseling, job placement, accommodations, and ongoing support.

**Current participation:** Over 130,000 veterans use VR&E services each year. Many have never heard of it before applying. It's one of VA's most underutilized but valuable benefits.

**Eligibility Requirements - Can You Qualify?**

Not all veterans qualify for VR&E. There are specific requirements.

**Requirement #1 - Service-connected disability rating:**

You must have a VA service-connected disability rating of at least 10%. This can be one condition rated 10% or higher, or multiple conditions combining to 10% or more.

If you don't have a service-connected rating yet, you can't apply for VR&E. File your disability claim first, get your rating, then apply for VR&E.

**Requirement #2 - Employment handicap:**

You must have an "employment handicap." This means your service-connected disability creates a substantial obstacle to you preparing for, obtaining, or maintaining suitable employment.

**What counts as an employment handicap:**

- Your service-connected condition prevents you from doing your previous job
- Your condition requires you to retrain for a different occupation
- Your condition limits the types of jobs you can perform
- Your condition makes it difficult to compete in the job market
- Your condition requires accommodations that employers may not provide without assistance

**Example:** Former infantryman with 50% rating for back and knee conditions. Can't do physical labor anymore. Needs to retrain for a desk job. Clear employment handicap.

**Example:** Veteran with 30% PTSD rating. Works in IT successfully, condition doesn't affect job performance or job prospects. No employment handicap for VR&E purposes - even though he has a service-connected disability.

**Requirement #3 - "Serious employment handicap" (for certain veterans):**

If you have a 20% or higher service-connected rating AND you're within the 12-year eligibility window (explained below), you only need to show an employment handicap.

If you have LESS than 20% rating, OR you're beyond the 12-year window, you must show a "serious employment handicap" - a more stringent standard meaning your disability substantially impairs your ability to work.

**Requirement #4 - 12-year basic period of eligibility:**

You must apply for VR&E within 12 years from one of these dates (whichever is later):
- Your date of separation from active duty, OR
- The date VA first notified you of a service-connected disability rating

**Example:** You separated in 2010. VA granted you a service-connected rating in 2015. Your 12-year window runs from 2015 to 2027 (12 years from rating notification).

**Extensions to the 12-year window:**

- If you have a serious employment handicap, VA can extend beyond 12 years
- If you're enrolled in VR&E and making satisfactory progress, you continue until program completion even if that extends past 12 years

**Bottom line qualification:** 10%+ service-connected rating, employment handicap related to your service-connected conditions, and generally within 12 years of separation or rating.

**The Five VR&E Service Tracks**

VR&E offers five different "tracks" depending on your employment goals and situation. When you apply, you'll work with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to determine which track fits your needs.

**Track #1 - Reemployment:**

This track helps you return to work with your most recent employer in your former position or a similar one.

**When you use this track:** You left your job due to deployment or service-connected disability, your former employer is willing to rehire you (possibly with accommodations), and returning to that specific job is viable given your current abilities.

**Services provided:** VA might help with job accommodations, assistive technology, or modifications needed for you to successfully return to your previous role.

**Track #2 - Rapid Access to Employment:**

This track gets you into a suitable job as quickly as possible with minimal or no training.

**When you use this track:** You have transferable skills from your military or civilian work, you don't need significant retraining, the job market has openings matching your current skills and limitations, and you're ready to work now.

**Services provided:** Resume preparation, interview coaching, job search assistance, direct job placement, short-term training if needed (usually under 6 months).

**Track #3 - Self-Employment:**

This track helps you develop and launch your own business.

**When you use this track:** You want to be self-employed, you have a viable business idea, self-employment suits your disability limitations better than traditional employment, and you're willing to go through business planning and development.

**Services provided:** Business plan development, entrepreneurship training, technical assistance, analysis of business viability, resources and guidance on starting your business.

**Important note:** VR&E doesn't fund your business. They help you plan and prepare to start it, but capital and startup costs are your responsibility.

**Track #4 - Employment Through Long-Term Services:**

This is the most common VR&E track. This track helps you get education or training needed to enter a different career field because your service-connected disability makes your previous work impossible or unsuitable.

**When you use this track:** Your service-connected condition prevents you from returning to your previous occupation, you need education or vocational training to qualify for a new career, your chosen career is suitable given your disabilities and abilities, and you're willing to commit to the training program (which might be 2-4 years).

**Services provided:**
- Post-secondary education (associate, bachelor's, or graduate degrees)
- Vocational or technical training
- Apprenticeships or on-the-job training
- Tuition and fees (100% covered, no cap)
- Books and supplies
- Monthly subsistence allowance
- Counseling and case management throughout program

**This is the track that functions most like an enhanced GI Bill** - except it's for veterans with service-connected disabilities affecting employment.

**Track #5 - Independent Living Services:**

This track is for veterans whose service-connected disabilities are so severe that employment isn't currently feasible. Instead, the focus is on helping you live as independently as possible.

**When you use this track:** Your service-connected disabilities prevent you from working in the foreseeable future, you need assistance with daily living activities, and improving your independence and quality of life is the priority.

**Services provided:** Assistive technology and devices, home modifications, personal adjustment counseling, independent living skills training, connection to community resources.

**Most veterans use Track #4 (Employment Through Long-Term Services).** This is the comprehensive education and training track. The rest of this episode focuses primarily on Track #4, though the benefits structure is similar across tracks.

**What Benefits Does VR&E Provide?**

If you're approved for VR&E and developing a rehabilitation plan with your counselor, here's what VA will cover:

**Tuition and fees - 100% covered with no cap:**

Unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill which caps private school tuition at $28,937 per year, VR&E has NO CAP. If your rehabilitation plan includes attending a private university costing $60,000 per year in tuition, VA pays all $60,000. This is a massive advantage for certain programs or schools.

**Books and supplies:** VA pays for required textbooks, materials, and supplies for your program. You'll submit receipts and get reimbursed, or VA pays the school directly depending on the arrangement.

**Subsistence allowance:**

While you're in training, VA pays you a monthly subsistence allowance to help with living expenses. The amount depends on:
- Your training rate (full-time, three-quarter time, half-time)
- Number of dependents
- Type of training

**2024-2025 rates (effective October 1, 2024):**

For institutional training (college/university), full-time, maximum rates:
- No dependents: $718.54/month
- One dependent: $894.51/month
- Two dependents: $1,063.23/month
- Each additional dependent: add approximately $150/month
- Maximum: $3,355.39/month (with multiple dependents)

**These rates are LOWER than Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance** for most locations. But there's an option...

**The Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH election:**

If you're eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you can elect to receive the GI Bill's Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) instead of the standard VR&E subsistence allowance.

**MHA rates:** Based on E-5 with dependents BAH for your school's ZIP code. Typically $1,600-$2,400/month depending on location. This is usually HIGHER than the standard VR&E subsistence allowance.

**The catch:** To elect MHA, you must have remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement. But here's the critical 2021 policy change...

**VR&E doesn't use up your GI Bill entitlement (2021 change):**

Before 2021, if you used VR&E and elected the MHA option, it counted against your 48 months of total education benefits. You were using GI Bill months even though you were in VR&E.

**Since 2021:** VR&E participation does NOT count against your GI Bill entitlement. You can use VR&E for 4 years to complete a bachelor's degree, elect the Post-9/11 MHA for housing allowance, and STILL have your full 36 months of GI Bill remaining afterward.

**This makes VR&E incredibly valuable** if you qualify. Free education at no cap, housing allowance, and you keep your GI Bill for future use (graduate school, career change, or to transfer to family).

**Counseling and case management:**

Throughout your VR&E participation, you work with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). They help you:
- Develop your individualized rehabilitation plan
- Choose appropriate schools and programs
- Navigate challenges during training
- Access additional support services
- Transition to employment after training
- Address barriers that arise

**This personalized support distinguishes VR&E from the GI Bill.** With GI Bill, you're largely on your own. With VR&E, you have a dedicated counselor.

**Employment services:**

When you near completion of your training, VR&E provides:
- Resume and cover letter assistance
- Interview preparation and coaching
- Job search strategies
- Direct referrals to employers
- Post-employment follow-up to ensure job retention

**VR&E's goal isn't just education - it's employment.** They track success by employment outcomes, not just degrees earned.

**How to Apply for VR&E**

Let's walk through the actual application process.

**Step One - Ensure you meet basic eligibility:**

10% or higher service-connected rating. If you don't have a rating yet, file your disability claim and get a rating first. Within 12 years of separation or rating notification (or have serious employment handicap if beyond 12 years).

**Step Two - Gather information:**

Have ready:
- Your service-connected disability ratings and decision letters
- Your employment history
- Your education history
- Your career goals and why your service-connected condition affects your ability to work in your previous field

**Step Three - Complete VA Form 28-1900:**

"Disabled Veterans Application for Vocational Rehabilitation."

**You can apply three ways:**

**Online (preferred):** Go to VA.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900/ and complete the application online. Takes about 30 minutes.

**By mail:** Download the PDF form, complete it, and mail to:
Department of Veterans Affairs
Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Intake Center
P.O. Box 5210
Janesville, WI 53547-5210

**In person:** Visit your local VA regional office and request assistance with VR&E application.

**Step Four - Initial evaluation:**

After VA receives your application, they'll schedule an initial evaluation appointment with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). This can be in-person or by phone/video.

**The VRC will assess:**
- Whether you have an employment handicap (or serious employment handicap if needed)
- What rehabilitation services might help you
- Your employability and career goals
- What track makes sense for you

**Step Five - Entitlement determination:**

Based on the evaluation, VA makes an "entitlement determination" - whether you're entitled to receive VR&E services. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after your evaluation.

If entitled: Move to Step Six.

If not entitled: You'll receive a letter explaining why. You have appeal rights if you disagree.

**Step Six - Develop individualized rehabilitation plan:**

Once entitled, you work with your VRC to develop your rehabilitation plan. This document outlines:
- Your employment goal (specific occupation)
- What training or education you'll pursue
- What school or program you'll attend
- Timeline for completion
- Services VA will provide
- Your responsibilities

**Both you and your VRC must sign this plan.** It's a contract - VA agrees to provide the services listed, you agree to pursue the plan and make satisfactory progress.

**Step Seven - Begin your program:**

Once the plan is signed and approved, you can start your training. Your VRC coordinates with the school to set up payment for tuition and fees. Your subsistence allowance begins when you start classes.

**Total application to program start timeline:** Typically 2-4 months, sometimes longer depending on school start dates and plan complexity.

**VR&E vs. GI Bill - Which Should You Use?**

If you qualify for both VR&E and GI Bill, which should you choose?

**Use VR&E if:**
- You have a service-connected disability affecting your employment prospects
- You need comprehensive support beyond just tuition payment
- You're attending an expensive private school (no tuition cap with VR&E)
- You want to preserve your GI Bill for later or to transfer to family
- You benefit from having a dedicated counselor and case management
- Your training will take longer than 36 months

**Use GI Bill if:**
- You don't have a service-connected disability rating of 10% or higher
- You don't have an employment handicap
- The school/program you want isn't appropriate for a VR&E plan (maybe it's not directly employment-focused)
- You want more flexibility to change schools or programs without needing approval
- You're attending a school where GI Bill's housing allowance exceeds VR&E subsistence (and you can't elect MHA)

**Can you use both?** Sort of. You can use VR&E for one program, then later use GI Bill for a different program (since VR&E no longer uses GI Bill entitlement). But you can't use both simultaneously for the same program.

**Strategic approach:** If you qualify for VR&E, use it for your bachelor's degree. Keep your GI Bill for graduate school or future retraining. You get two complete education benefits instead of just one.

**Common VR&E Mistakes and Misconceptions**

**Mistake #1: Thinking you don't qualify because your rating is "only" 10-30%.**

If you have an employment handicap related to your service-connected condition, you likely qualify. Don't assume you need a high rating. Many veterans with 10-20% ratings successfully use VR&E.

**Mistake #2: Not applying because you're outside the 12-year window.**

If you have a serious employment handicap, you can still qualify beyond 12 years. Apply anyway and let VA determine eligibility. Many veterans assume they're ineligible when they're not.

**Mistake #3: Treating VR&E like it's automatic money for any degree.**

VR&E requires a rehabilitation plan tied to employability. You can't just decide you want to study philosophy for fun. The program and career goal must be reasonable given your disabilities, the job market, and employment prospects.

**Mistake #4: Not engaging with your VRC.**

Your VRC is your partner in this. If you ignore their guidance, miss meetings, or don't communicate, your plan can be suspended or terminated. Engage actively with your counselor.

**Mistake #5: Assuming VR&E and GI Bill are the same thing.**

They're completely different programs with different eligibility, different benefits, and different purposes. Using VR&E doesn't mean you "used your GI Bill." Understand the distinction.

**The Real Value of VR&E**

Let's put numbers on what VR&E can provide:

**4-year bachelor's degree at private university:**
- Tuition: $50,000/year × 4 = $200,000
- Books: $1,500/year × 4 = $6,000
- Subsistence/MHA: $2,000/month × 9 months × 4 years = $72,000
- Counseling and employment services: Invaluable
- Total package: $278,000+

**AND you still have your full GI Bill afterward.**

**For a veteran with a service-connected disability affecting employment, VR&E is one of the single most valuable VA benefits available.** It can completely transform your career trajectory at zero cost.

If you have a 10%+ service-connected rating and your disability affects your ability to work in your previous field, apply for VR&E. The worst they can say is no. The best they can say is yes, and you get a fully-funded education with support services.
