[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of disabled veterans paying property taxes they don't have to pay. In 2025, if you're a veteran with a VA disability rating of 10% or higher, you likely qualify for some level of property tax exemption—but here's the catch: it's not automatic. I've talked to 70% disabled veterans who paid $4,000 a year in property taxes for five years straight because they didn't know they qualified for an exemption. That's $20,000 gone forever. If you're 100% disabled in one of 20 states, you might qualify for COMPLETE exemption—zero property taxes for life. But you have to apply.

This is Jacob, your host on the Veteran Transition Blueprint podcast. I'm a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're doing a complete deep dive on state property tax exemptions for disabled veterans. We're covering which states offer what benefits, exactly how to apply, what documentation you need, the common mistakes that get applications denied, and how to calculate what your exemption is actually worth. By the end of this episode, you'll know if you're leaving money on the table and exactly what to do about it.

Let's get into it.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Segment 1: Understanding Property Tax Exemptions - The Basics**

Before we dive into specific states, you need to understand how property tax exemptions work because they're structured differently than any other veteran benefit.

**What Is a Property Tax Exemption?**

A property tax exemption reduces the assessed value of your home for tax purposes. Here's a simple example:

- Your home is worth $300,000
- Your county's property tax rate is 1.5%
- Normally, you'd pay $4,500 per year in property taxes
- If your state gives you a $100,000 assessed value exemption, you'd only pay taxes on $200,000
- New tax bill: $3,000 (saving you $1,500/year)

Some states offer DOLLAR AMOUNT exemptions (like "first $50,000 is exempt"), others offer PERCENTAGE exemptions (like "50% of assessed value exempt"), and still others offer FIXED DOLLAR REDUCTIONS (like "$1,500 off your tax bill").

**Key Things to Know:**

1. **These are STATE benefits, not federal**: Every state has different rules, different disability rating requirements, and different application processes

2. **NOT automatic**: Unlike your VA disability compensation which you filed for once, property tax exemptions require you to apply with your county or city tax assessor's office

3. **Primary residence only**: Almost all exemptions only apply to your primary residence, not rental properties or second homes

4. **May require annual renewal**: Some states grant permanent exemptions once approved; others require you to reapply annually

5. **Can be retroactive in some states**: Some states will give you a refund for past years if you should have qualified but didn't apply

**The Big Picture:**

All 50 states offer SOME form of property tax benefit for disabled veterans. But the range is massive:
- Best case: Full exemption (you pay $0 in property taxes)
- Worst case: Small fixed reduction (like $500 off your annual bill)

Your disability rating determines what you qualify for. Generally:
- 10-30%: Minimal exemptions ($500-2,000 assessed value reduction)
- 40-60%: Moderate exemptions ($5,000-10,000 reduction or partial percentage exemption)
- 70-90%: Strong exemptions (often $20,000-50,000+ or 50% of value)
- 100% Permanent and Total: Full or near-full exemption in many states

Let's break down the top-tier states first.

**Segment 2: The 20 States with FULL Property Tax Exemptions for 100% Disabled Veterans**

If you're rated 100% Permanent and Total (P&T) by the VA, these 20 states will exempt you from paying ANY property taxes on your primary residence:

**1. Alabama**: Full exemption on up to 160 acres for 100% P&T veterans, no income limit

**2. Arkansas**: Full exemption for 100% P&T veterans on primary residence

**3. Florida**: Full exemption for 100% P&T veterans (must be Florida resident on January 1 of tax year)

**4. Hawaii**: Full exemption except for $150 on three of four main islands for 100% disabled veterans

**5. Illinois**: Full exemption for veterans or surviving spouses with 70%+ VA rating (one of the best in the nation since it starts at 70%, not 100%)

**6. Iowa**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans

**7. Louisiana**: Full exemption for 100% service-connected disabled veterans on homestead property up to $75,000 (assessed value)

**8. Maryland**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans

**9. Michigan**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans or those receiving specially adapted housing grants (NEW as of 2025: no annual reapplication required)

**10. Mississippi**: Full exemption for 100% disabled veterans on homestead property

**11. Nebraska**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans on homestead

**12. New Hampshire**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans (New Hampshire also has no state income tax)

**13. New Jersey**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans

**14. New Mexico**: Full exemption for veterans rated 100% disabled by the VA

**15. Oklahoma**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans on homestead

**16. Pennsylvania**: Full exemption for 100% wartime disabled veterans IF household income is below $114,637 (2025 limit)—surviving spouses may qualify

**17. South Carolina**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans on primary residence

**18. Tennessee**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans on homestead

**19. Texas**: Full exemption for 100% P&T or TDIU veterans on primary residence (no income limit, no acreage limit)

**20. Virginia**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans on primary residence

**21. West Virginia**: Full exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans on homestead up to $20,000 assessed value

**What This Means in Dollars:**

Let's say you own a $350,000 home in Texas where the average property tax rate is about 1.35%:
- Normal annual property taxes: $4,725
- With 100% P&T exemption: $0
- Annual savings: $4,725
- Savings over 20 years: $94,500

That's nearly a hundred thousand dollars back in your pocket over a typical retirement, and all you had to do was submit an application.

**Segment 3: States with Strong Partial Exemptions (Not 100% P&T)**

If you're not at 100% P&T, or if you live in a state that doesn't offer full exemption, here are the states with the best partial benefits:

**Alaska**: Veterans with 50%+ disability rating receive a $150,000 property value exemption
- On a $300,000 home at 1.2% tax rate: Saves $1,800/year

**California**: Veterans with 100% disability or receiving compensation for unemployability can exempt up to $175,298 (basic exemption) or $262,950 (low-income exemption if prior-year household income doesn't exceed $78,718) from assessed value in 2025
- This can save $1,500-3,000+ annually depending on county

**Colorado**: Veterans with 100% P&T rating receive a 50% exemption on the first $200,000 of home value
- On a $300,000 home: Exempt $100,000 of value

**Connecticut**: NEW as of October 2024: Full property tax exemption for 100% P&T disabled veterans (applies to 2025 tax bill)

**Idaho**: Veterans with 100% disability or unemployability designation receive up to $1,500 reduction regardless of income

**Indiana**: Veterans with 100% P&T receive full exemption; 10-90% ratings receive deductions based on percentage (10% = $12,480 deduction; 70% = $37,440 deduction)

**Kansas**: Veterans with 50%+ disability rating are exempt from paying property taxes on up to $14,200 of appraised value

**Minnesota**: Veterans with 70%+ disability rating receive up to $300,000 market value exclusion (one of the most generous in the nation)

**Missouri**: Veterans with 100% P&T exempt from property taxes; 50-99% ratings receive partial exemptions

**Montana**: Veterans with 100% P&T receive full exemption; partial exemptions available for lower ratings

**Wisconsin**: Veterans with 100% P&T exempt from property taxes; surviving spouses also qualify

**Wyoming**: Veterans with 100% P&T receive full exemption on first $3,000 of assessed value (assessed value is typically much lower than market value in Wyoming)

**Segment 4: How to Apply - The Step-by-Step Process**

Here's the tactical process for claiming your property tax exemption:

**Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility**

Before you do anything, confirm:
1. Your current VA disability rating (check your VA.gov account or call 1-800-827-1000)
2. Whether your rating is "Permanent and Total" (look for "P&T" on your rating letter)
3. Whether your home is your primary residence (you live there most of the year)
4. Whether you meet any income requirements (some states have income caps)

**Step 2: Find Your Local Tax Assessor's Office**

Property tax exemptions are administered at the COUNTY or CITY level, not the state level. Google "[Your County Name] tax assessor" or "[Your County Name] property appraiser."

For example:
- Texas: County Appraisal District (CAD)
- Florida: County Property Appraiser
- California: County Assessor's Office

**Step 3: Gather Required Documentation**

You will need:

1. **VA Benefit Summary Letter**: This is the most important document. It shows your current disability rating and whether it's permanent. Get it from:
   - VA.gov (log in → My VA → Download VA Letters)
   - Call 1-800-827-1000 and request they mail it
   - Visit your local VA Regional Office

2. **DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)**: Proves your military service and discharge status. If you don't have yours:
   - Request from National Archives (eVetRecs): https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records
   - Usually takes 7-10 business days

3. **Proof of Primary Residence**: This can be:
   - Driver's license showing your current address
   - Voter registration card
   - Utility bills in your name

4. **Photo ID**: Government-issued ID (driver's license or passport)

5. **Property Deed** (in some states): Proves you own the home

**Pro Tip**: Call your assessor's office BEFORE gathering documents. Ask exactly what they require. Some offices accept digital uploads; others require original documents or certified copies.

**Step 4: Complete the Application Form**

Most states have specific forms:
- Texas: "Residence Homestead Exemption Application" plus "Disabled Veteran's or Survivor's Exemption Application"
- Florida: "Application for Homestead and Related Tax Exemptions" (DR-501)
- California: "Claim for Disabled Veterans' Property Tax Exemption" (BOE-261-G)

Download the form from your assessor's website or pick it up in person.

**Fill out the form completely**:
- Enter your VA file number or claim number
- Your disability rating percentage
- Whether your rating is Permanent and Total
- Property address and parcel number (find this on your property tax bill)
- Your social security number

**Step 5: Submit Your Application**

Submit your application by the deadline. Deadlines vary by state:
- Texas: By April 30 of the tax year
- Florida: By March 1 of the tax year
- California: By February 15 of the assessment year
- Some states: Within one year of purchasing your home

**Methods of submission**:
- In person (fastest—they can tell you immediately if anything is missing)
- By mail (get tracking confirmation)
- Online (increasingly common)

**Step 6: Follow Up**

After submitting:
1. Get a confirmation receipt or tracking number
2. Ask how long approval typically takes (usually 2-8 weeks)
3. If you don't hear back within that timeframe, call to follow up
4. Once approved, verify it appears on your next property tax bill

**Segment 5: Common Mistakes That Get Applications Denied (And How to Avoid Them)**

After talking to dozens of tax assessor offices and veterans who've been denied, here are the most common mistakes:

**Mistake #1: Submitting Outdated VA Letters**

Some states require your VA Benefit Summary Letter to be dated within the last 12 months. If your letter is from 2022 and you're applying in 2025, they'll reject it.

**Solution**: Download a fresh VA Benefit Summary Letter from VA.gov before you apply. It's free and takes 30 seconds.

**Mistake #2: Applying for the Wrong Property**

The exemption only applies to your PRIMARY residence—where you actually live most of the year. If you're applying for a rental property, vacation home, or second residence, you'll be denied.

**Solution**: Only apply for the home where you live full-time and can prove residency (driver's license, voter registration, etc.).

**Mistake #3: Missing the Deadline**

If your state requires application by April 30 and you submit on May 2, you're waiting until next year.

**Solution**: Mark the deadline on your calendar and submit at least 30 days early to allow time for any issues.

**Mistake #4: Not Including All Required Documents**

If the application requires a DD-214 and you don't include it, your application sits in limbo until you provide it—or gets denied.

**Solution**: Call ahead and create a checklist of EVERY required document. Submit everything at once.

**Mistake #5: Applying for the Wrong Exemption Level**

Some states have multiple exemption tiers. If you're 80% disabled but you accidentally apply for the 100% exemption form, you'll be denied—even though you qualify for a different exemption.

**Solution**: Confirm which exemption tier matches your rating before applying.

**Mistake #6: Not Reapplying After a Rating Increase**

Let's say you initially applied with a 40% rating and got a small exemption. Two years later, you're increased to 100% P&T. Your exemption doesn't automatically upgrade.

**Solution**: Anytime your VA rating increases, reapply for a higher exemption tier.

**Mistake #7: Forgetting to Reapply Annually (in States That Require It)**

Some states grant one-time permanent exemptions; others require annual renewal. If you don't reapply, your exemption expires and you get hit with a full tax bill.

**Solution**: When you're approved, ask: "Is this permanent or do I need to reapply each year?" Set a calendar reminder if annual renewal is required.

**Segment 6: Special Situations - Surviving Spouses, TDIU, and Retroactive Exemptions**

**Surviving Spouses:**

In most states, if a 100% P&T disabled veteran dies, the surviving spouse can CONTINUE receiving the property tax exemption as long as they:
- Don't remarry
- Continue to own and occupy the property
- File for the exemption as a surviving spouse

States with strong surviving spouse benefits: Texas, Florida, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania.

**TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability):**

If you're receiving TDIU (100% compensation due to unemployability even though your schedular rating is lower), many states treat you the same as 100% P&T for exemption purposes. Check with your assessor's office—you might qualify for full exemption even if your schedular rating is 70% or 80%.

**Retroactive Exemptions:**

Some states allow you to claim a refund for previous years if you qualified but didn't apply. For example:
- Texas: Can go back up to two years in some cases
- California: May be able to claim previous years if you file within the statute of limitations

If you just realized you've been overpaying for years, call your tax assessor and ask: "Can I get a refund for prior years if I should have qualified?"

---

**Segment 7: How to Calculate What Your Exemption Is Worth**

Let's do the math so you know what you're actually saving:

**Formula:**
```
Annual Tax Savings = (Exemption Amount × Property Tax Rate)
```

**Example 1: Texas 100% P&T Veteran**
- Home value: $400,000
- County tax rate: 1.25%
- Normal annual taxes: $5,000
- With full exemption: $0
- **Annual savings: $5,000**
- **20-year savings: $100,000**

**Example 2: California 100% Disabled Veteran (Low-Income)**
- Home assessed value: $500,000
- County tax rate: 1.0%
- Low-income exemption: $262,950
- Normal annual taxes: $5,000
- Exempted amount taxes: $2,629.50
- New annual taxes: $2,370.50
- **Annual savings: $2,629.50**
- **20-year savings: $52,590**

**Example 3: Alaska 50% Disabled Veteran**
- Home value: $350,000
- City tax rate: 1.2%
- Exemption: $150,000 of value
- Normal annual taxes: $4,200
- Exempted amount taxes: $1,800
- New annual taxes: $2,400
- **Annual savings: $1,800**
- **20-year savings: $36,000**

Use this calculator to find your numbers:
1. Find your current property tax bill (or estimate: home value × local tax rate)
2. Find your state's exemption amount for your disability rating
3. Multiply exemption amount × tax rate = your annual savings
4. Multiply annual savings × 20 years = potential lifetime savings

If the number is more than $500/year, it's worth the 2-3 hours to complete the application.

---

**Segment 8: Action Steps - File Your Exemption This Month**

Here's your tactical action plan:

**This Week:**

1. **Check your VA rating and P&T status**: Log into VA.gov → My VA → Download VA Letters → VA Benefit Summary Letter

2. **Google your county tax assessor**: Find their phone number and office hours

3. **Call and ask these questions**:
   - "What property tax exemptions are available for a veteran with [X%] VA disability rating?"
   - "What documentation do I need to apply?"
   - "What's the application deadline?"
   - "Is this exemption permanent or do I need to reapply annually?"

**Next Week:**

1. **Gather all required documents**: VA letter, DD-214, proof of residence, photo ID

2. **Download and complete the application form** (from assessor's website)

3. **Make copies of everything** before you submit

**By End of Month:**

1. **Submit your application** (in person if possible)

2. **Get confirmation receipt**

3. **Set calendar reminder** to follow up in 30 days if you haven't heard back

4. **If annual renewal required**: Set annual calendar reminder for 60 days before deadline

---

[CONCLUSION]

Let's wrap this up. Property tax exemptions for disabled veterans are real money—often $2,000-5,000 per year, sometimes more. Over a 20-30 year retirement, we're talking about $40,000-150,000 in total savings. But unlike your VA disability compensation, property tax exemptions are NOT automatic. You have to apply at the county or city level, you have to provide documentation, and you have to meet deadlines.

If you're a disabled veteran who owns a home, there is a very high chance you qualify for some level of property tax reduction. The question is: are you claiming it? Twenty states offer FULL exemptions for 100% P&T veterans—you could be paying zero property taxes for the rest of your life. Even if you're at 10%, many states offer $500-2,000 in annual savings.

The process takes 2-3 hours total: gathering documents, filling out a form, submitting it to your county assessor. That's it. Don't leave this money on the table. If you've been paying property taxes for years and didn't know you qualified, call your assessor this week and ask about retroactive refunds—you might be able to recover some of that money.

Resources for this episode, including a state-by-state exemption chart, downloadable checklist, and links to every state's application forms, are available at militarytransitiontoolkit.com. Next episode, we're covering state education benefits beyond the GI Bill—free tuition programs you might not know about.

Until next time—this is Jacob. Don't pay more taxes than you have to.
