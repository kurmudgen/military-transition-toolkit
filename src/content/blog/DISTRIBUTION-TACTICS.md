## LinkedIn Distribution

### Profile Optimization

**Headline**: "Helping 10K+ Veterans Transition to Civilian Careers | Founder, Military Transition Toolkit | [Branch] Veteran"

**Summary**:
```
I help service members transition from military to civilian careers.

After struggling with my own transition from [MOS] to [current role],
I built Military Transition Toolkit to help others avoid the mistakes
I made.

Today, we've helped 10,000+ veterans:
✓ Find careers that match their MOS
✓ Land jobs paying $10K-$20K more than expected
✓ Maximize their VA benefits
✓ Use the GI Bill strategically

If you're transitioning in the next 6-24 months, let's connect.

Resources: militarytransitiontoolkit.com
```

---

### Content Strategy

**Post 3x/week**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (9am ET)

**Monday: Educational Carousel**
- 5-7 slide carousel (LinkedIn loves carousels)
- Teach something valuable
- Last slide = CTA

**Example**:
```
Slide 1: "7 Mistakes Veterans Make on Resumes"
Slide 2: "1. Using military jargon civilians don't understand"
Slide 3: "2. Focusing on duties instead of accomplishments"
...
Slide 7: "Want help? Use our free Resume Translator → [link]"
```

**Wednesday: Data/Insight Post**
- Share interesting stat or insight
- Add your commentary
- Ask question to drive engagement

**Example**:
```
65% of veterans accept their first job offer without negotiating.

This is a $10K-$20K mistake.

Here's why: Employers expect you to negotiate. They budget for it.
If you don't negotiate, you're leaving money on the table AND signaling
you don't know your worth.

Always negotiate. Worst case: they say no and you take the original offer.

Have you negotiated your salary? Share your experience in comments.
```

**Friday: Success Story**
- Share veteran testimonial/success story
- Before/after narrative
- Inspire others

**Example**:
```
Meet John. 11B Infantry, 6 years.

His biggest fear: "I thought I could only be a cop or security guard."

18 months later: Project Manager at Amazon, $90K salary, remote.

What John did differently:
1. Started planning 18 months before separation (not 6)
2. Earned PMP certification ($800 investment, $20K salary boost)
3. Networked on LinkedIn (got job through connection)
4. Used our Resume Translator to convert military experience

Your transition doesn't have to be hard. It just needs to be planned.

[Video interview with John → link]

Transitioning soon? Let's connect.
```

---

### Engagement Strategy

**30 min/day**:
- Comment on 10-15 posts in veteran/HR/recruiting spaces
- Add value (not "nice post!")
- Include relevant insights
- End with question to continue conversation

**Example Comment**:
```
On post about veteran unemployment:

"Great point about skills translation. I've found the #1 issue is
veterans don't know how to articulate their value in civilian terms.

'Led a 12-man squad' doesn't mean anything to HR.

'Managed team of 12, coordinated logistics for $2M+ in equipment,
maintained 98% mission readiness' = project management experience.

Same job. Different language.

Have you seen other common translation mistakes?"
```

**Connection Requests**:
- Send 10-20/day to:
  - Veterans (offer help with transition)
  - HR professionals at military-friendly companies
  - Recruiters who specialize in veterans
  - VSO employees

**Message Template**:
```
Hi [Name],

I see you're [title] at [company]. I'm helping service members transition
to civilian careers through my platform, Military Transition Toolkit.

I'd love to connect and potentially collaborate on veteran hiring initiatives.

Are you open to connecting?

[Your Name]
```

## Reddit & Community Engagement

### Target Subreddits

**Daily Engagement** (15 min/day):
- r/Veterans (390K members) - MAIN FOCUS

**Weekly Engagement** (5 min/day):
- r/army (185K)
- r/USMC (74K)
- r/navy (70K)
- r/AirForce (216K)

---

### Engagement Strategy

**80/20 Rule**: 80% value, 20% promotion

**Daily Routine**:
1. Answer 3-5 questions in r/Veterans
2. Provide genuine advice (not sales pitch)
3. Link to free resources (blog posts, tools) when relevant
4. Build karma and reputation

**Example Response**:
```
User: "I'm a 68W separating in 6 months. How do I become a paramedic?"

Your Response:
"Congrats on your upcoming transition! 68W to paramedic is a great path.

Here's the roadmap:

1. Get your EMT-Basic certification (~3 months, $1,500)
   - Many states accept your military training for this
   - Check NREMT for requirements by state

2. Work as EMT for 6-12 months (gain civilian experience)
   - Entry pay: $30K-$40K
   - This is required for most paramedic programs

3. Complete paramedic program (12-18 months, $5K-$10K)
   - Use GI Bill for this (will cover tuition + BAH)
   - Community colleges often have programs

4. Get NREMT-P certification
   - National registry exam
   - Then state licensure

5. Work as paramedic
   - Starting pay: $45K-$55K
   - With experience: $55K-$75K

I wrote a complete guide on this (6,000 words, covers everything above
plus certifications, schools, hiring, salary negotiation).

[Link to guide]

Also have a free tool to see all healthcare careers for 68W:
