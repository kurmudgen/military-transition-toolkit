## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Here's what's different in the civilian world:

**FAA regulations vs. NAVAIR instructions:** Civilian parachute rigging follows FAA Part 65 Subpart F and manufacturer specifications. Aviation life support follows FAA and manufacturer requirements instead of NAVAIR instructions. The concepts are the same—follow technical data, maintain quality standards, document everything—but the specific regulations differ. You'll learn this quickly.

**Business operations mindset:** Military life support programs focus on readiness and safety. Civilian operations add cost efficiency and customer satisfaction. Dropzones need to turn parachutes quickly to generate revenue. Industrial safety companies bid on contracts. You'll balance safety (non-negotiable) with business realities (speed, cost, customer relations).

**Customer interaction:** In the Navy, your "customers" were aircrew you knew personally. In civilian work, you'll interact with customers who may not understand technical requirements or safety needs. You'll need patience explaining why certain procedures can't be rushed or why equipment must be replaced, not just repaired.

**Less structured environment:** Military life support programs have clear procedures for everything. Civilian operations vary widely. Small dropzones may have minimal procedures. Large aerospace companies have extensive quality systems. You'll need to adapt to different organizational cultures and levels of structure.

**Broader skillset expectations:** Civilian employers with small operations may expect you to do more than just PR work. A dropzone rigger might also pack tandem rigs, handle customers, and help with aircraft marshaling. Industrial safety techs might inspect multiple types of equipment. Versatility matters more in civilian jobs.
