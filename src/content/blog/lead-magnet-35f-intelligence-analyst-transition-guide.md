## 7. INTERVIEW PREPARATION

### **COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR 35F TRANSITIONS**

**Question 1: "Tell me about your military intelligence experience."**

**Bad Answer:** "I was a 35F Intelligence Analyst. I did intel stuff."

**Good Answer:**
"I was an All-Source Intelligence Analyst in the Army, which means I collected and analyzed information from multiple sources—signals intelligence, human intelligence, and open-source intelligence—to identify threats and support decision-making. I produced daily intelligence reports and briefed commanders on threat assessments affecting our operations. This experience taught me how to process large amounts of information, identify patterns, and communicate findings clearly to leadership—skills I'm excited to bring to this data analyst role."

**Key:** Translate 35F to civilian terms, emphasize transferable skills

---

**Question 2: "You don't have direct civilian experience in this field. Why should we hire you?"**

**Bad Answer:** "I'm a hard worker and I learn fast."

**Good Answer:**
"While I don't have direct civilian experience, I've spent the last 5 years doing essentially the same work in a higher-stakes environment. As an intelligence analyst, I analyzed multi-source data, identified patterns and anomalies, produced reports under tight deadlines, and briefed findings to senior leaders—the exact skills this cybersecurity analyst role requires. The only difference is the type of data: I analyzed threat data in the military; I'll analyze network security data here. Plus, I've earned my Security+ certification and built a home lab to learn tools like Splunk and Wireshark. I'm ready to contribute from day one."

**Key:** Show how military experience = civilian experience, prove you've prepared

---

**Question 3: "Describe a time you had to analyze complex information and make a recommendation."**

**STAR Method Answer:**

**Situation:** "In my unit, we were seeing increased IED activity in our area of operations, but the pattern wasn't clear."

**Task:** "My commander asked me to analyze the data and recommend where to focus our security efforts."

**Action:** "I collected data from the past 90 days—location, time, type of attack—and created a heat map showing where attacks were concentrated. I cross-referenced this with SIGINT reports and identified a pattern: attacks clustered near a specific route during evening hours. I briefed my findings to the battalion commander and recommended increased patrols on that route during high-risk times."

**Result:** "The commander implemented my recommendation. Over the next 30 days, we had zero IED incidents on that route. My analysis directly contributed to protecting our soldiers."

**Key:** Use military examples, translate to business terms, show impact

---

**Question 4: "What certifications do you have or are you pursuing?"**

**Bad Answer:** "I don't have any yet."

**Good Answer:**
"I have my CompTIA Security+ certification, which is the DoD 8570 baseline and shows I understand cybersecurity fundamentals. I'm also currently studying for my CISSP—I've completed 3 of the 8 domains—and plan to sit for the exam in the next 3 months. Additionally, I've completed the Google Data Analytics certificate on Coursera, which taught me SQL, Tableau, and statistical analysis. I believe in continuous learning and I'm committed to staying current in this field."

**Key:** Show you're proactive about learning, have baseline certs, pursuing advanced

---

### **QUESTIONS TO ASK THE INTERVIEWER**

1. "What does a typical day look like for someone in this role?"

## 8. SALARY NEGOTIATION SCRIPTS

### **SCENARIO 1: THEY ASK YOUR SALARY EXPECTATIONS**

**Recruiter:** "What are your salary expectations?"

**Your Response (Option 1 - Deflect):**
"I'm flexible on salary and more focused on finding the right fit. I'm confident we can agree on a fair number once we both feel this is a good match. Can you share the salary range for this position?"

**Your Response (Option 2 - Give Range Based on Research):**
"Based on my research and the requirements of this role, I'd expect a salary in the range of $85,000 to $100,000, but I'm open to discussion based on the total compensation package. What range do you have budgeted for this position?"

**Key:** Never give a single number. Always give a range with your target as the low end.

---

### **SCENARIO 2: THEY MAKE AN OFFER (It's Lower Than Expected)**

**Recruiter:** "We'd like to offer you the position at $75,000."

**Your Response:**
"Thank you so much for the offer—I'm really excited about this opportunity and the team. I was hoping we could discuss the salary. Based on my research and the value I'll bring with my intelligence analysis background and Security+ certification, I was expecting something closer to $85,000-$90,000. Is there flexibility in the budget?"

**Key:** Express enthusiasm, then counter. Always justify your ask.

---

### **SCENARIO 3: LEVERAGING YOUR CLEARANCE**

**Recruiter:** "Our budget for this role is $80,000."

**Your Response:**
"I appreciate that. One thing I wanted to highlight is my active TS/SCI clearance. For this role, that clearance is worth $20,000-$30,000 in value to the company since you don't have to sponsor one. Considering that, I think $95,000 is fair for someone with my clearance, analytical experience, and certifications. Can we work toward that number?"

**Key:** Clearance = premium. Use it.

---

### **SCENARIO 4: NEGOTIATING BEYOND SALARY**

**Recruiter:** "We can't go higher than $85,000. That's the max for the role."

**Your Response:**
"I understand the budget constraints. If $85,000 is the maximum base salary, I'd like to discuss other aspects of the compensation package:
• Is there flexibility on the sign-on bonus? Perhaps $5,000-$10,000 to help with relocation costs?
• Can we start me at 3 weeks of PTO instead of 2?
• Is there a professional development budget I could use for certifications like CISSP?
• Would the company consider a 6-month performance review with the opportunity for a raise to $90,000 if I meet goals?

Which of these might be possible?"

**Key:** If salary is fixed, negotiate PTO, sign-on, training budget, or earlier review.
