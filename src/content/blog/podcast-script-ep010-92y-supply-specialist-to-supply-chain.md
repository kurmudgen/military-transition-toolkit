[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

You're a 92 Yankee. You've managed millions of dollars in equipment and supplies, maintained accountability for thousands of items, and kept units operational through effective supply chain management. Civilian companies need exactly those skills - and they pay sixty to one hundred thousand dollars plus for them. [pause] Let's talk about how to make that transition.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're talking to Army Unit Supply Specialists - 92 Yankees. Whether you want to work in procurement, inventory management, warehouse operations, or supply chain analysis, your military experience translates directly to high-paying civilian careers.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering supply chain careers that pay sixty to one hundred thousand plus, the certifications that increase your value, which companies actively hire 92Ys, and your complete transition roadmap. If you're 92Y and getting out, this is your guide to six-figure supply chain careers. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 22-24 minutes]

**Segment 1: Your 92Y Experience Translated to Civilian Value (4 minutes)**

As a 92Y, you've been doing professional supply chain management work. Let me break down what you actually bring to civilian employers.

You've operated automated supply systems - GCSS-Army, that's Global Combat Support System-Army. You've managed property accountability, requisitioned supplies, processed receipts and turn-ins, maintained inventory records, coordinated with vendors and suppliers, and tracked equipment worth millions of dollars.

If you've been a senior 92Y or supply sergeant, you've supervised other specialists, managed budgets, forecasted needs, and ensured your unit had what it needed when it needed it.

That's supply chain management. That's procurement. That's inventory control. All of these are critical civilian business functions.

Here's why civilian companies value 92Ys:

**First** - you understand accountability and accuracy. In the Army, losing accountability of equipment can end careers. You've been trained to maintain meticulous records and account for every item. Civilian companies lose millions to inventory shrinkage and poor tracking. They need people who take accountability seriously.

**Second** - you can work with supply chain software. You've used GCSS-Army and other automated systems. Learning civilian ERP systems - like SAP, Oracle, or JD Edwards - will be easier because you already understand the concepts.

**Third** - you know procurement and purchasing. You've created requisitions, worked with vendors, negotiated with suppliers, and managed the procurement process. That's exactly what civilian purchasing agents do.

**Fourth** - you understand logistics and distribution. You've coordinated equipment movements, managed warehousing, and ensured supplies reached the right place at the right time.

Now let's talk earning potential. As a 92Y on active duty, if you're an E5 or E6, you're making around $50,000 to $60,000 total compensation.

Civilian supply chain careers pay: Purchasing agents $60K-$80K, inventory managers $55K-$75K, supply chain analysts $60K-$90K, procurement managers $75K-$95K, warehouse managers $60K-$85K, and supply chain managers $80K-$120K+.

Senior supply chain directors at large companies can make $140K-$180K+. So there's significant upward mobility.

**Segment 2: Civilian Career Paths for 92Ys (6 minutes)**

Let me break down the major career paths and what they pay.

**Purchasing Agent / Buyer**

You're responsible for purchasing goods and services for a company. You evaluate suppliers, negotiate contracts, place orders, manage vendor relationships, and ensure cost-effective purchasing.

Salary: $60,000 to $80,000 depending on industry and company size. Senior buyers and purchasing managers make $75,000 to $95,000+.

Your 92Y experience with requisitioning, vendor coordination, and procurement translates directly to this role.

**Inventory Manager / Inventory Control Specialist**

Managing inventory levels, tracking stock, conducting cycle counts, analyzing inventory data, preventing shortages and overstock, implementing inventory control procedures.

Salary: $55,000 to $75,000. Senior inventory managers at large companies make $70,000 to $90,000+.

This is a natural fit for 92Ys who've managed property books and maintained accountability for thousands of items.

**Supply Chain Analyst**

Analyzing supply chain data, identifying inefficiencies, recommending improvements, forecasting demand, optimizing inventory levels, working with software to generate reports and insights.

Salary: $60,000 to $90,000. This role typically requires strong analytical skills and proficiency with data analysis tools like Excel, Tableau, or supply chain software.

If you're comfortable with data and analysis, this path offers good pay and growth potential.

**Warehouse Manager / Distribution Center Manager**

Managing warehouse operations - receiving, storage, picking, packing, shipping. Supervising warehouse staff, implementing safety procedures, optimizing warehouse layout and processes, managing inventory accuracy.

Salary: Warehouse managers make $60,000 to $85,000. Distribution center managers at large facilities make $75,000 to $105,000+.

If you were a supply sergeant managing supply rooms or supply operations, you have management experience applicable here.

**Procurement Manager**

Overseeing the procurement department, developing procurement strategies, managing purchasing staff, negotiating major contracts, ensuring cost savings, managing supplier relationships.

Salary: $75,000 to $100,000+. Senior procurement managers at large corporations can make $95,000 to $125,000+.

This is a management-level role that requires experience, but it's achievable for senior 92Ys or those who gain a few years of civilian procurement experience.

**Logistics Coordinator**

Coordinating the movement of goods - working with carriers, scheduling shipments, tracking deliveries, resolving issues, optimizing transportation costs.

Salary: $50,000 to $70,000. Senior logistics coordinators make $65,000 to $80,000.

Your experience coordinating equipment movements and working with transportation assets applies here.

**Materials Manager**

Managing the flow of materials through production or operations - planning material requirements, scheduling deliveries to production lines, managing inventory of raw materials and components, coordinating with suppliers and production teams.

Salary: $70,000 to $95,000. This is common in manufacturing companies.

**Supply Chain Manager**

High-level role overseeing end-to-end supply chain operations - procurement, inventory, warehousing, distribution, vendor management, supply chain strategy.

Salary: $80,000 to $120,000+. Senior supply chain managers at Fortune 500 companies can make $120,000 to $160,000+.

This is typically a 5-10 year career goal. You start in a junior role, gain experience, possibly get certifications, and move up to management.

**Companies actively hiring 92Ys:**

**Retail**: Walmart, Target, Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe's (massive supply chain operations)
**Manufacturing**: General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, any major manufacturer
**Logistics**: DHL, FedEx, UPS, XPO Logistics, C.H. Robinson
**Technology**: Apple, Dell, HP, Cisco (all need supply chain professionals)
**Healthcare**: Hospital systems, medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies
**Government Contractors**: Maintain military supply chains as civilians
**Food & Beverage**: Sysco, US Foods, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo

All of these companies need supply chain professionals and many actively recruit veterans.

**Segment 3: Certifications That Increase Your Value (5 minutes)**

While your 92Y experience is valuable, certifications can significantly increase your earning potential and make you more competitive.

**APICS CSCP - Certified Supply Chain Professional**

This is the gold standard certification in supply chain. It covers all aspects of supply chain management - procurement, production, inventory, distribution.

Cost: Around $1,200 for APICS membership, study materials, and exam.

Study time: 3-6 months depending on your background.

Value: CSCP holders typically earn $10,000 to $20,000 more than non-certified professionals. Many companies specifically look for CSCP certification in job postings.

**APICS CPIM - Certified in Production and Inventory Management**

Focuses on production planning, inventory management, and supply chain fundamentals.

Cost: Similar to CSCP, around $1,000 to $1,500 total.

Value: Highly regarded, especially in manufacturing companies.

**ISM CPSM - Certified Professional in Supply Management**

Offered by the Institute for Supply Management, focuses on procurement and supplier management.

Cost: Around $2,000 to $2,500 for all three exams.

Value: This is specifically valuable if you're going the procurement/purchasing route.

**Certified Purchasing Professional (CPP)**

Entry-level purchasing certification, easier to obtain than CPSM.

Cost: Around $500 for exam.

Value: Good starting certification if you're going into purchasing roles.

**Six Sigma certifications (Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt)**

Process improvement methodology widely used in supply chain and operations.

Cost: Varies by provider, $300 to $3,000 depending on level.

Value: Shows you can improve processes and eliminate waste. Very valuable in manufacturing and logistics companies.

**My certification recommendation:**

**While still in service (12-18 months before separation)**: Start studying for APICS CSCP or CPIM. You can use your GI Bill or tuition assistance to pay for study materials and training courses.

**First year civilian**: Complete CSCP or CPIM certification. This positions you for higher-paying roles and promotions.

**Years 2-3**: Consider Six Sigma Green Belt or additional specialized certifications based on your career path.

You don't need certifications to get hired - your 92Y experience is valuable on its own - but certifications can accelerate your career and increase your earning potential significantly.

**Segment 4: Education Options - Do You Need a Degree? (3-4 minutes)**

This is a common question: do you need a bachelor's degree for supply chain careers?

The answer: it depends on the role and company.

**For entry and mid-level positions** - purchasing agent, inventory manager, logistics coordinator, warehouse manager - many companies will hire based on experience alone, especially if you have military supply chain experience and relevant certifications.

**For management and analyst positions** - supply chain manager, supply chain analyst, procurement manager - many companies prefer or require a bachelor's degree. However, they're often flexible on the field of study. A degree in supply chain management is ideal, but degrees in business, logistics, or even unrelated fields can work if you have the experience.

**If you don't have a degree**, I recommend one of these paths:

**Option 1**: Get hired based on your 92Y experience and certifications, work for 2-3 years, then pursue a degree part-time using employer tuition assistance (many companies offer this). By the time you finish your degree, you'll have civilian experience plus education.

**Option 2**: Use your GI Bill to get a bachelor's degree in supply chain management, logistics, or business administration. This takes 3-4 years if you're full-time. When you graduate, you'll have both military experience and a degree, making you very competitive.

**Option 3**: Get an associate's degree (2 years) in logistics or supply chain, work while in school, then decide if you want to complete your bachelor's later.

**My recommendation:** If you can get hired based on experience and certifications, do that. Get your foot in the door, start earning money, and pursue education part-time if needed. Many supply chain professionals have built successful careers without degrees, especially if they have strong experience and certifications.

But if you're struggling to get interviews, or if you're targeting roles at Fortune 500 companies that require degrees, then using your GI Bill for education is a solid investment.

**Segment 5: Your Transition Timeline and Action Plan (3-4 minutes)**

Here's your step-by-step plan:

**12 months before separation:**

Research supply chain certifications. Decide if you want to pursue APICS CSCP, CPIM, or other certs.

Start studying for your chosen certification. Use free resources online, or purchase study materials. Many certification bodies offer veteran discounts.

Build your LinkedIn profile. Connect with supply chain professionals, join supply chain groups, start networking.

**6-9 months before separation:**

Take your certification exam. Having CSCP or CPIM on your resume before you separate gives you a significant advantage.

Update your resume. Translate your 92Y experience to civilian supply chain language. Instead of "managed unit property book," say "maintained inventory accountability for 2,000+ items valued at $5M with 100% accuracy."

**3-6 months before separation:**

Apply for SkillBridge positions with companies that have supply chain operations - Amazon, Walmart, major manufacturers, logistics companies.

Start applying to jobs even if you haven't separated yet. Put your expected separation date on your resume.

Research companies. Identify 20-30 target companies with strong supply chain operations and veteran hiring programs.

**1-2 months before separation:**

Interview actively. Practice translating your military experience to civilian terms.

Negotiate offers. Don't accept the first offer without negotiation. Research market rates and ask for competitive compensation.

**Post-separation:**

Start your civilian role. Be prepared for different culture - civilian supply chain moves faster in some ways, slower in others.

Continue learning. Supply chain is constantly evolving. Stay current with industry trends, new technologies, and best practices.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap.

92Y Unit Supply Specialists have direct pathways to supply chain, procurement, and logistics careers paying $60K to $120K+. Your experience with inventory management, procurement, and supply chain software translates directly to civilian roles.

Career paths include purchasing agent ($60K-$80K), inventory manager ($55K-$75K), supply chain analyst ($60K-$90K), warehouse manager ($60K-$85K), procurement manager ($75K-$100K), and supply chain manager ($80K-$120K+).

APICS CSCP certification is the gold standard - adds $10K-$20K to your earning potential. Get it while you're still in or in your first civilian year.

Companies actively hiring include Walmart, Amazon, Target, major manufacturers, logistics companies, and government contractors. Use SkillBridge to get experience before you separate.

Degrees help but aren't always required - experience plus certifications can get you hired. Use GI Bill strategically based on your career goals.
