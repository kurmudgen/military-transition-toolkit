[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** SkillBridge lets you work civilian job final one hundred eighty days active duty while receiving full military pay and benefits. Four thousand seven hundred companies participating. New DOD goal: Seventy-five percent of participants should get job offers. Only ten percent eligible service members use this. Free test drive of civilian career before you separate. Here's how to use it.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**What Is SkillBridge?**

Official name: DoD SkillBridge Program. Allows service members to gain civilian work experience through specific industry training, apprenticeships, or internships during final 180 days of service (up to 6 months). You remain active duty - receiving full pay, benefits, housing allowance, healthcare - while working full-time for civilian employer.

Think of it as paid internship where military pays you, not employer. Employer gets free talent for up to 6 months. You get real-world experience, professional network, and often job offer. Win-win.

Started 2011, expanded significantly. Now 4,700+ registered employers including Microsoft, General Motors, McKinsey, CrowdStrike, Georgia Power, Department of Interior, VA, and thousands of small businesses. 200,000 troops separate annually - only 10-11% use SkillBridge. Massive opportunity most miss.

**August 2024 Updates:**

DoD modernized SkillBridge with new policies. Key changes:

**75% Job Offer Goal:** Pentagon now expects at least 75% of service members who successfully complete SkillBridge to receive job offer from host company. This is new standard - holds companies accountable.

**Better Data Tracking:** Previously, DoD couldn't verify how many participated or got hired (poor data collection). New system launching fiscal year 2026 will track outcomes. Transparency improves program quality.

**Structured Enrollment Periods:** Starting October 1, 2024, SkillBridge applications follow structured enrollment periods. Less ad-hoc, more organized process. Check with your service's Career Skills Program (CSP) office for timeline.

**3-Year Company Requirement:** New participating companies must be established 3+ years. Prevents fly-by-night operations exploiting free labor without hiring intent.

These changes improve program quality and accountability. Better for service members.

**Eligibility - Can You Do SkillBridge?**

**Basic Requirements:**
- 180 days or fewer remaining until separation/retirement
- Completed at least 180 continuous days of active duty service
- Commander approval from your chain of command
- Completed (or scheduled) Transition Assistance Program (TAP)

**Who Can Apply:**
- Any rank - enlisted or officer
- Active duty all branches (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Space Force, Coast Guard)
- Guard/Reserve on active orders meeting criteria
- Medical retirees (if commander approves and meets timeline)

**Who Approves:**
First field-grade commander in your chain of command authorized to impose non-judicial punishment under Article 15 UCMJ. Typically Battalion Commander level or equivalent. Approval based on unit mission requirements.

**Key Point:** Approval not automatic. If your unit short-staffed or critical mission window during your final 180 days, commander can deny. Apply early, make strong case for why this benefits your transition.

**How to Apply - Step by Step:**

**Step 1 - Start Early (12+ Months Out):**

Don't wait until 6 months before separation. Research opportunities 12+ months out. Competitive SkillBridge programs (Microsoft, McKinsey, major companies) fill quickly. Early bird gets the job.

**Step 2 - Attend SkillBridge Briefing:**

Each installation has SkillBridge POC (Point of Contact) - usually in Transition Assistance Office, Education Office, or Career Skills Program Office. Attend information briefing. Learn branch-specific requirements and application process.

**Step 3 - Search Opportunities:**

Visit skillbridge.osd.mil - official DoD SkillBridge website. Search by:
- Location (where do you want to work?)
- Industry (tech, healthcare, finance, trades, government, etc.)
- Company name (if targeting specific employer)

Filter results by what matters to you. Review program descriptions, application requirements, and whether program has history of hiring interns.

**Additional Resources:**
- Hiring Our Heroes Corporate Fellowship Program (hiringourheroes.org)
- Military.com SkillBridge listings
- LinkedIn search: "SkillBridge opportunities [industry]"
- Network with veterans who did SkillBridge - ask about their experience

**Step 4 - Apply to Programs:**

Each program has own application process. Generally includes:
- Resume (civilian format - translate military experience)
- Cover letter explaining why you're interested
- Sometimes interview with company
- Reference letters (optional but helpful)

**Pro Tip:** Apply to 3-5 programs. Don't put all eggs in one basket. Some programs competitive (McKinsey, Microsoft, major tech). Diversify applications increases acceptance odds.

**Step 5 - Get Command Approval:**

Once accepted by SkillBridge program, you need command approval. Submit paperwork through your chain of command. Required documents vary by service but typically include:

- SkillBridge application/request form
- Program acceptance letter from employer
- Transition timeline showing you meet 180-day window
- TAP completion certificate (or scheduled date)
- Justification explaining how this supports your transition

**Timing:** Allow 30-60 days for approval process. Commands can deny based on mission needs. If denied, you can apply to different program with different dates or appeal through IG if denial unreasonable.

**Step 6 - Complete Pre-Departure Requirements:**

Before starting SkillBridge:
- Out-process paperwork with unit (partial out-processing)
- Coordinate housing if relocating for opportunity
- Ensure you maintain contact with unit for admin requirements
- Set up direct deposit, verify pay continues
- Confirm healthcare coverage extends to new location

**You're still active duty.** Subject to UCMJ. Must maintain standards. If you mess up at SkillBridge job, consequences include removal from program and potential UCMJ action.

**Types of SkillBridge Opportunities:**

**Corporate Internships:**
Work at major companies in specific role. Examples:
- Microsoft: Software development, cloud computing, cybersecurity roles
- McKinsey: 10-week consulting fellowship learning business strategy
- General Motors: Manufacturing, engineering, supply chain
- CrowdStrike: Cybersecurity, threat intelligence

These typically 3-6 months, structured programs with mentorship. High conversion to full-time offers if you perform well.

**Small Business Apprenticeships:**
Work with local businesses learning trade or profession. Examples:
- HVAC companies training technicians
- IT firms teaching network administration
- Real estate agencies training agents
- Construction companies teaching project management

More hands-on, less structured. Conversion rates vary - some hire immediately, others provide experience but no offer. Research company's hiring track record.

**Federal/State Government:**
Internships with government agencies:
- VA hospitals (healthcare, claims processing, IT)
- Department of Interior (park rangers, environmental science)
- Customs and Border Protection
- State veteran services departments
- Intelligence agencies (if you have clearance)

Federal SkillBridge often leads to direct hire. Veterans preference applies. If you want federal career, government SkillBridge smart path.

**Veteran Service Organizations:**
Organizations like Hiring Our Heroes, Vets2PM, and veteran-focused nonprofits offer structured programs combining training, certification prep, and industry connections. Not traditional internships - more like career accelerator programs.

**Education/Certification Programs:**
Some SkillBridge programs focus on certification training:
- Project Management Professional (PMP) boot camp
- Cybersecurity certifications (Security+, CISSP)
- Trade certifications (HVAC, electrician)
- Healthcare certifications (EMT, phlebotomy)

These provide credential + some internship hours. Job offer not guaranteed but certification increases marketability.

**What You Can and Cannot Do During SkillBridge:**

**You CAN:**
- Work full-time for civilian employer (typically 40 hours/week)
- Receive full military pay and benefits (BAH, BAS, healthcare)
- Live off-installation if job requires relocation
- Take leave if needed (coordinate with both unit and employer)
- Use tuition assistance if program includes education component

**You CANNOT:**
- Receive wages from employer (DoD pays you, not company - this is free labor for employer)
- Accept salary, hourly pay, or cash benefits from employer
- Work for family member's business (conflict of interest)
- Do SkillBridge if it delays your separation date (program must fit within existing terminal leave/separation timeline)
- Ignore military obligations - still subject to UCMJ, must maintain contact with unit

**What Happens if Recalled:** Extremely rare, but if military recalls you during SkillBridge due to emergency (war, natural disaster, unit crisis), you return to active duty. SkillBridge pauses or ends. Nature of remaining active duty service member.

**Maximizing Your SkillBridge Success:**

**Choose Program Aligned with Career Goals:**

Don't do SkillBridge just to do it. Choose opportunity matching your post-military career path.

- Targeting tech? Apply to Microsoft, CrowdStrike, local IT companies.
- Want consulting? Apply to McKinsey, Booz Allen, Deloitte.
- Interested in trades? Apply to HVAC, electrician, plumbing apprenticeships.
- Federal career? Apply to VA, DoI, CBP programs.

SkillBridge isn't vacation. It's strategic career move. Treat it like 6-month job interview because that's what it is.

**Treat It Like Real Job (Because It Is):**

Show up on time. Dress appropriately. Take initiative. Ask questions. Network with coworkers. Deliver quality work. Your performance directly impacts whether you get offer.

New DoD goal: 75% of SkillBridge participants should get offers. But this means 25% might not. What differentiates the 75% from the 25%? Work ethic, attitude, skills, cultural fit.

Military taught you discipline, reliability, attention to detail. Use these advantages. Show civilian employer what "military standards" means.

**Network Aggressively:**

SkillBridge isn't just about learning job - it's about building professional network. Connect with:
- Your direct supervisor (reference for future jobs)
- Coworkers in your department (industry connections)
- Other departments (expand understanding of company)
- Company leadership (informational interviews if possible)
- Local veteran employees (mentorship and guidance)

Add everyone on LinkedIn. Get coffee with people. Ask about their career paths. Build relationships. Even if THIS company doesn't hire you, your network refers you elsewhere.

**Ask About Full-Time Opportunity Early:**

Month 2-3 of SkillBridge, have conversation with supervisor:

"I'm really enjoying my time here and learning a lot. I'm interested in continuing with [Company] after I separate. What's the process for transitioning from SkillBridge to full-time employee? What do I need to demonstrate to be considered?"

This signals interest, shows initiative, and gives you clarity on what they're evaluating. Some companies hire automatically if intern performs well. Others have formal interview process. Knowing expectations helps you prepare.

**Document Your Accomplishments:**

Keep running list of projects completed, problems solved, metrics improved, skills learned. Use this for:
- Your resume (update it during SkillBridge with civilian experience)
- Full-time interview (if required)
- Future job applications (if this company doesn't hire you)

Civilian experience + military experience = strong candidate for any employer.

**Have Backup Plan:**

75% job offer rate means 25% don't get offers. Don't assume SkillBridge guarantees job. Continue applying to other jobs during your SkillBridge. Network externally. If company offers job - great! If not, you have other options lined up.

**The Job Offer Conversation:**

**If They Offer Position:**

"Thank you! I'm excited about the opportunity. Can we discuss compensation, benefits, and start date?"

Negotiate like any job offer:
- Salary based on market research
- Benefits package evaluation
- Start date (can you start immediately after separation or need gap?)
- Relocation assistance if applicable

Don't accept on the spot. Take 24-48 hours to review written offer. SkillBridge gave you inside view - you know company culture, job reality, team dynamics. Informed decision possible.

**If They Don't Offer Position:**

"I understand. Can you provide feedback on my performance and areas where I could improve? Also, would you be willing to serve as a reference for my job search?"

Professional response. Most will provide honest feedback. Many will serve as references - valuable for your job search. Don't burn bridges. They might have opening later or know someone who's hiring.

**If Offer Below Market Rate:**

"I appreciate the offer. Based on my research, market rate for this role with my experience is [range]. Given my SkillBridge performance, I'm hoping we can align closer to [higher figure]. What's possible?"

Don't accept lowball offer just because they hosted your SkillBridge. Negotiate like any civilian candidate. Your SkillBridge proved your value - they had 3-6 months to evaluate you. If they want you, they'll pay market rate.

**Research Before Applying:** Check program reviews on ratemyskb.com (SkillBridge review site), ask veterans who completed program, verify hiring track record.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

**Mistake 1:** Waiting too long to apply. Competitive programs fill 6-12 months in advance. Start researching year before separation.

**Mistake 2:** Choosing program based on location only. "I want to live in Austin" ≠ career strategy. Choose based on career goals, then consider location.

**Mistake 3:** Treating it like vacation. SkillBridge is full-time work. Employer evaluating you for permanent hire. Slacking off = no job offer.

**Mistake 4:** Not networking. SkillBridge isn't just about doing job - it's about building relationships that lead to opportunities.

**Mistake 5:** Assuming job offer guaranteed. 25% don't get offers. Have backup plan. Keep applying to other jobs during SkillBridge.

**Mistake 6:** Accepting bad fit because they offered. If company culture toxic, pay terrible, or job not what you want - it's okay to decline and find better fit.

**Mistake 7:** Burning bridges if no offer. Stay professional. Request feedback. Ask for reference. You never know who they know or when opportunity might circle back.

**Timeline - When to Do What:**

**12-18 Months Before Separation:**
- Attend SkillBridge briefing at installation TAP office
- Research programs on skillbridge.osd.mil
- Network with veterans who completed programs in your field

- Coordinate housing/logistics if relocating

**4-6 Months Before Separation:**
