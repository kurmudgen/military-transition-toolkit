# C&P Exam for Back Pain: Range of Motion Testing Explained (2025)

The back pain C&P exam is one of the most important appointments in your VA disability claim. Your rating depends primarily on range of motion measurements taken during this exam—and understanding how these measurements work can mean the difference between a 10% and 40% rating.

This guide covers everything you need to know about the spine C&P exam.

## What Is the Back Pain C&P Exam?

The Compensation & Pension exam for back conditions evaluates:
1. Current diagnosis of your spine condition
2. **Range of motion** (the primary rating factor)
3. Functional impairment
4. Neurological symptoms (radiculopathy)
5. Service connection (nexus opinion)

The examiner uses a goniometer (angle-measuring device) to measure how far you can move your spine in each direction.

## How Range of Motion Determines Your Rating

The VA rates most spine conditions under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine. **Your forward flexion measurement is the most important number.**

### Thoracolumbar Spine (Lower Back) Ratings

| Forward Flexion | Rating |
|-----------------|--------|
| Greater than 60° | 10% |
| Greater than 30° but not greater than 60° | 20% |
| 30° or less | 40% |
| Favorable ankylosis | 30% |
| Unfavorable ankylosis | 50% |
| Unfavorable ankylosis of entire spine | 100% |

**Or based on combined range of motion:**

| Combined ROM | Rating |
|--------------|--------|
| Greater than 120° | 10% |
| 120° or less | 20% |

**Normal values:**
- Forward flexion: 90°
- Extension: 30°
- Left lateral flexion: 30°
- Right lateral flexion: 30°
- Left rotation: 30°
- Right rotation: 30°
- **Total combined ROM: 240°**

### Cervical Spine (Neck) Ratings

| Forward Flexion | Rating |
|-----------------|--------|
| Greater than 30° but not greater than 40° | 10% |
| Greater than 15° but not greater than 30° | 20% |
| 15° or less | 30% |
| Favorable ankylosis | 30% |
| Unfavorable ankylosis | 40% |

**Normal cervical values:**
- Forward flexion: 45°
- Extension: 45°
- Combined ROM: 340°

## What Happens During the Exam

### Check-In and History

The examiner reviews your claims file and asks about:
- When your back pain started
- What caused it
- Current symptoms
- Treatment history
- Impact on daily activities

### Range of Motion Testing

The examiner will ask you to:

**Standing:**
1. **Bend forward** (touch your toes) - measuring flexion
2. **Lean back** - measuring extension
3. **Bend sideways** (each direction) - measuring lateral flexion
4. **Twist** (each direction) - measuring rotation

They'll measure:
- **Active range of motion**: How far YOU can move
- **Passive range of motion**: How far the examiner can move you
- **After repetitive use**: Three repetitions, then remeasure

### Neurological Examination

If you have radiculopathy (nerve symptoms), they'll test:
- Strength in your legs/arms
- Sensation (light touch, pin prick)
- Reflexes
- Straight leg raise test (sciatic nerve)

### Additional Tests

- Palpation (feeling for tenderness)
- Muscle spasm assessment
- Posture evaluation
- Gait observation

## The DeLuca Factors: Why They Matter

The landmark case **DeLuca v. Brown** established that the VA must consider functional loss beyond just range of motion. These "DeLuca factors" include:

1. **Pain on movement**
2. **Weakened movement**
3. **Excess fatigability**
4. **Incoordination**
5. **Flare-ups**

### How DeLuca Affects Your Rating

The examiner should note where **pain begins** during motion—not just where motion ends.

**Example:**
- Your physical range of motion is 70° flexion
- But pain starts at 45°
- Your functional limitation is 45°, potentially warranting 20% instead of 10%

### How to Ensure DeLuca Is Considered

**Tell the examiner when pain begins:**
"I can bend further but the pain starts right about here [at 45°]."

**Don't push through severe pain:**
Stop where the pain becomes significant. Don't try to impress the examiner.

**Mention functional limitations:**
"After bending a few times, my back locks up and I can barely stand straight."

## Flare-Ups: Critical Information

Flare-ups are periods when your condition is significantly worse than baseline. The examiner **must** document flare-ups.

### What to Tell the Examiner

1. **How often** do flare-ups occur? (Weekly? Monthly?)
2. **How long** do they last? (Hours? Days?)
3. **What triggers** them? (Activity, weather, stress?)
4. **How severe** are they compared to baseline?
5. **What can't you do** during a flare-up?

### Getting Flare-Ups Documented

**Example statement:**
"I have flare-ups about twice a week that last 1-2 days. During a flare-up, I can barely bend forward at all—maybe 10 degrees before the pain is too severe. I have to stay in bed. Today is actually a moderate day for me."

The examiner should estimate your ROM during flare-ups, even if not observed.

## How to Prepare

### Before the Exam

**1. Know your normal pain levels**
- What's your baseline?
- How bad are your worst days?
- What triggers make it worse?

**2. Document flare-ups**
Keep a log for several weeks before the exam noting:
- Pain levels (1-10)
- Activities that cause pain
- Flare-up dates and duration

**3. List all symptoms**
- Back pain location
- Stiffness
- Muscle spasms
- Radiating pain (legs? buttocks?)
- Numbness/tingling
- Weakness
- Bladder/bowel issues

**4. Prepare specific examples**
- "I can't put on my socks without sitting down"
- "I can't stand for more than 15 minutes"
- "I can't lift my grandchildren"

### What to Bring

- Photo ID
- List of current medications
- List of symptoms and limitations
- Notes on flare-up frequency
- Any assistive devices you use (back brace, cane)

### Day of the Exam

**Don't take extra pain medication:**
You want to be assessed as you normally are, not artificially better or worse.

**Wear comfortable clothing:**
You'll need to bend and move. Loose clothes help.

**If it's a bad pain day:**
Go anyway. Bad pain days show the examiner your actual condition. If it's a rare good day, tell them.

## During the Exam: Tips

### Be Honest

Don't exaggerate—examiners are trained to detect inconsistencies. But also don't minimize. Show your actual limitations.

### Stop When Pain Starts

Don't push through severe pain to demonstrate range of motion. Stop where the functional limitation is:

**Examiner**: "Bend forward as far as you can."
**You**: [Bending] "This is where the pain really kicks in." [Stop]

### Describe the Pain

"Sharp pain across my lower back that shoots into my left leg when I bend."

### Mention Repetitive Use Effects

"If I bend down repeatedly, like doing laundry, my back seizes up and I have to lay down."

### Talk About Your Worst Days

"Today is about a 5 out of 10 for me. On my worst days, I can barely get out of bed."

### Don't Forget Neurological Symptoms

If you have radiculopathy:
- "I have constant numbness in my left foot"
- "My right leg feels weak when I walk"
- "I get shooting pain down my legs when I bend"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Pushing Through Pain

Don't bend until you physically can't move. Stop where significant pain begins.

### 2. Taking Pain Medication Before the Exam

You want the examiner to see your normal condition, not medicated condition.

### 3. Not Mentioning Flare-Ups

If you don't bring up flare-ups, the examiner may not document them.

### 4. Minimizing Symptoms

"I manage" doesn't help your claim. "I had to quit my job because I couldn't stand for 8 hours" does.

### 5. Forgetting Neurological Symptoms

If you have radiculopathy, it's rated separately. Don't forget to mention nerve symptoms.

### 6. Showing Up on a Good Day Without Context

If today is unusually good, tell the examiner. "I feel better than usual today. Most days the pain is worse."

## IVDS (Incapacitating Episodes)

If you have disc disease with incapacitating episodes, you may qualify for rating under the IVDS formula:

| Incapacitating Episodes Per Year | Rating |
|----------------------------------|--------|
| At least 1 week but less than 2 weeks | 10% |
| At least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks | 20% |
| At least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks | 40% |
| At least 6 weeks | 60% |

**Incapacitating episode** = bed rest prescribed by a physician

Tell the examiner about any bed rest your doctor has prescribed.

## Radiculopathy: The Secondary Claim

If your back condition causes nerve symptoms (pain, numbness, weakness in legs), you should be evaluated for radiculopathy. This is rated separately.

### During the Exam

**Describe radiating symptoms:**
- "The pain shoots from my lower back down my left leg to my ankle"
- "I have constant numbness in my right foot"
- "My left leg feels weak, especially when going up stairs"

**The straight leg raise test:**
The examiner lifts your leg while you're lying down. If this causes radiating pain, it indicates nerve involvement.

### Radiculopathy Ratings (Per Extremity)

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | 10% |
| Moderate | 20% |
| Severe | 40% |

Each leg is rated separately.

## After the Exam

### What Happens Next

The examiner completes a DBQ and sends it to the VA. You'll receive a rating decision, typically 2-8 weeks later.

### Requesting the DBQ

You can request a copy of the completed DBQ through your VA records. Review it for accuracy.

### If You Disagree

Options include:
- **Supplemental Claim** with new evidence
- **Higher Level Review** for errors
- **Board Appeal**

If your ROM was measured on a good day and doesn't reflect your typical condition, appeal with documentation of normal functioning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if my pain varies day to day?

Describe your typical day and your worst days. The examiner should consider flare-ups.

### Can I wear my back brace?

Bring it to show the examiner, but you'll likely remove it for the physical exam.

### What if I can't complete the range of motion tests?

That's important information. Your inability to move indicates significant limitation.

### Should I stretch before the exam?

No. You want to be assessed as you normally are.

### What if the examiner seems rushed?

Speak up. "I also want to mention that I have flare-ups twice a week where the pain is much worse."

### How do I prove flare-ups if the examiner doesn't see one?

Document flare-ups before the exam. Buddy statements from family members help.

## Bottom Line

The back pain C&P exam is primarily about range of motion, but pain, functional limitation, flare-ups, and neurological symptoms all affect your rating.

Key takeaways:
- Stop movement where significant pain begins
- Describe and document flare-ups
- Mention neurological symptoms (radiculopathy)
- Don't push through pain to show "toughness"
- Be specific about functional limitations
- Don't take extra pain meds before the exam

Your rating depends on this exam. Prepare accordingly.
