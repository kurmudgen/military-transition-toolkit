## Bottom Line Up Front

Navy Machinery Repairmen manufacture precision parts using lathes, mills, drill presses, CNC machines, and welding equipment to repair shipboard machinery. That's **precision machining, metal fabrication, welding, and machine shop operations**—skills that translate directly to civilian manufacturing, machining, fabrication shops, and industrial maintenance. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$58,000**, with experienced machinists and welders hitting **$65,000-$80,000+**. Tool and die makers, CNC programmers, and welding inspectors can reach **$85,000-$95,000+**. You'll need certifications (AWS welding, NIMS machining), but your hands-on Navy machine shop experience puts you ahead of civilian entry-level candidates.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every MR looking at civilian careers sees the same discouraging narrative: "Machine shops are dying." "Manufacturing is dead in America." "You'll be competing with robots."

Here's the reality: **advanced manufacturing is booming, and companies can't find skilled machinists and welders fast enough.**

You didn't just "fix stuff." You:
- Manufactured replacement parts to tight tolerances using manual and CNC machinery
- Operated lathes, mills, boring machines, grinders, and computer-controlled equipment
- Read and interpreted engineering drawings, blueprints, and technical specifications
- Used precision measuring instruments (micrometers, calipers, gauge blocks, verniers)
- Performed welding, brazing, and metal fabrication for repairs
- Maintained quality control standards for critical components
- Worked independently and solved complex machining problems
- Operated safely in high-risk environments with rotating machinery and cutting tools

That's **precision manufacturing, CNC machining, quality control, welding, and problem-solving**. Those skills are in high demand across aerospace, defense, automotive, energy, and medical device manufacturing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects favorable job opportunities for machinists and tool makers through 2033. You're not competing with robots—you're programming and maintaining them.

## Best civilian career paths for MRs

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where MRs land jobs with real 2024-2025 salary data.

### CNC machinist / CNC operator (most common entry path)

**Civilian job titles:**

Manual machining is less common than CNC, but it's not dead. Job shops, maintenance shops, tool rooms, and prototype/R&D facilities all need manual machinists who can make one-off parts or repair components.

This work requires more skill and experience than running CNC. You're figuring out setups, calculating speeds and feeds, and solving problems without a programmed cycle.

Pay is good, especially in specialized industries (aerospace tool rooms, nuclear maintenance, shipyards). Your Navy MR experience operating manual equipment is exactly what these employers need.

Job shops (small manufacturing companies that make custom parts) hire manual machinists year-round. The work is varied—every job is different—and you're using all your skills.

**Best for:** MRs who prefer hands-on manual machining over CNC operation and like variety in their work.

### Welder / welding technician

**Civilian job titles:**
- Welder
- Structural welder

- **Industrial maintenance certifications** (through employers or technical schools)

**Reality check:**
Many manufacturers have in-house machine shops for making replacement parts and modifying equipment. They need maintenance machinists who can operate lathes, mills, and welders to keep production running.

This is hybrid work—part machinist, part maintenance mechanic. You're not running production jobs; you're making the part that's needed RIGHT NOW to fix a broken machine.

Your Navy MR background is perfect for this. You made parts under pressure to keep ship systems operational. That's exactly what plant machinists do.

Pay is solid, work is steady, and you're valued because downtime costs companies thousands per hour. Manufacturing plants, power plants, mines, and large facilities all need maintenance machinists.

**Best for:** MRs who want variety, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of keeping operations running.

### Quality control inspector / quality technician

**Civilian job titles:**
