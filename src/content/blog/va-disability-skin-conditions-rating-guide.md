# VA Disability Rating for Skin Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Skin conditions are rated under **Diagnostic Codes 7800-7833** with ratings from **0% to 60%** (or higher for disfigurement). Common conditions include **eczema**, **psoriasis**, **dermatitis**, and **acne**. Ratings are based on **percentage of body affected**, **percentage of exposed areas affected**, and **type of treatment required** (topical vs. systemic). Some skin conditions are **presumptive for Agent Orange** and **PACT Act (burn pit) exposure**. The key evidence is dermatology evaluation documenting body surface area involved and treatment. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## Common Skin Conditions

### Eczema/Dermatitis (DC 7806)
- Atopic dermatitis
- Contact dermatitis
- Seborrheic dermatitis
- Nummular eczema

### Psoriasis (DC 7816)
- Plaque psoriasis
- Guttate psoriasis
- Inverse psoriasis
- Pustular psoriasis

### Other Conditions
- **Acne** (DC 7828)
- **Scars** (DC 7800-7805) - separate rating guide available
- **Urticaria/Hives** (DC 7825)
- **Chloracne** (DC 7829) - Agent Orange presumptive
- **Skin cancer** (various codes)

**Military connections:**

### Direct Service Connection
- Onset during service
- Environmental exposures (chemicals, sun, climate)
- Stress-induced flares
- Contact with irritants

### Presumptive Conditions
- **Chloracne**: Agent Orange presumptive (must manifest within 1 year)
- **Skin cancer**: Agent Orange and PACT Act presumptive (certain types)

### Secondary Service Connection
- Secondary to medications
- Secondary to diabetes (skin complications)
- Secondary to immune conditions

## VA Rating Criteria

### DC 7806 - Dermatitis/Eczema (Also used for many other skin conditions)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Less than 5% of entire body OR exposed areas affected, AND no more than topical therapy required during past 12 months |
| **10%** | At least 5%, but less than 20%, of entire body OR exposed areas affected; OR intermittent systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months |
| **30%** | 20 to 40% of entire body OR exposed areas affected; OR systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, during the past 12 months |
| **60%** | More than 40% of entire body OR exposed areas affected; OR constant or near-constant systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs required during the past 12 months |

### DC 7816 - Psoriasis

Uses the same rating criteria as dermatitis (DC 7806).

### DC 7828 - Acne

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Superficial acne (comedones, papules, pustules, superficial cysts) of any extent |
| **10%** | Deep acne (deep inflamed nodules and pus-filled cysts) affecting less than 40% of face and neck, or deep acne other than on face and neck |
| **30%** | Deep acne (deep inflamed nodules and pus-filled cysts) affecting 40% or more of face and neck |

**Note:** Acne with scarring can be rated under scar codes for disfigurement.

### DC 7829 - Chloracne

Uses dermatitis rating criteria (DC 7806). Agent Orange presumptive.

### DC 7825 - Urticaria (Hives)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Requiring continuous or near-continuous treatment with antihistamines or sympathomimetics |
| **30%** | Recurrent episodes occurring at least 4 times during past 12 months requiring immunosuppressive drugs for control, OR more than 50% of body surface area affected, OR no response to antihistamines |
| **60%** | Recurrent debilitating episodes occurring at least 4 times during past 12 months despite continuous immunosuppressive therapy |

### Understanding Key Terms

**Exposed Areas**: Face, neck, hands—areas visible in normal dress.

**Systemic Therapy**: Oral or injected medications (prednisone, methotrexate, biologics), NOT topical creams.

**Body Surface Area (BSA)**: Percentage of skin affected. The "Rule of Nines" is often used:
- Head/neck: 9%
- Each arm: 9%
- Anterior trunk: 18%
- Posterior trunk: 18%
- Each leg: 18%
- Genitals: 1%

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing skin complaints
- Documentation of environmental exposures
- Buddy statements about in-service symptoms
- Photos from service showing skin conditions

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Dermatology evaluation
- Specific diagnosis
- Body surface area affected (documented with percentages)
- Photos of affected areas

### Severity Evidence
- Treatment records showing medications used
- Documentation of systemic therapy (and duration)
- Flare frequency
- Impact on daily life

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Examine all affected skin areas
2. Calculate body surface area involved
3. Document exposed areas affected
4. Review treatment history
5. Identify specific diagnosis
6. May take photos

**Important Tips:**

**Schedule exam during flare:** If possible, request your exam when your condition is active, not during remission. Call to reschedule if needed.

**What to tell them:**
- All affected areas (don't forget scalp, groin, feet)
- Treatment history (especially systemic medications)
- How long you've taken oral steroids or other systemic drugs
- Frequency of flares
- Impact on work and daily life

**Bring to exam:**
- List of all medications (topical AND systemic)
- Duration of systemic treatment in past 12 months
- Photos of condition during flares

## Secondary Conditions

**Skin conditions can be secondary to:**
- Diabetes (skin manifestations)
- Medications for other conditions
- Stress from PTSD/mental health conditions
- Immune disorders

**Skin conditions can cause:**
- Depression/anxiety (appearance, chronic condition)
- Sleep disturbance (itching)
- Social isolation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What counts as "systemic therapy"?
Oral medications (like prednisone, methotrexate) or injected medications (like biologics). Topical creams do NOT count as systemic therapy.

### Does it matter where the skin condition is located?
Yes. The criteria consider both total body surface area AND exposed areas (face, neck, hands). Higher percentages in either category can lead to higher ratings.

### What if my condition comes and goes?
Track flare frequency and duration. If possible, schedule your C&P exam during an active flare. Document with photos and treatment records.

### Is chloracne presumptive?
Yes, chloracne is presumptive for Agent Orange exposure, BUT it must have manifested within one year of last exposure.

### Can I claim skin cancer?
Yes. Some skin cancers are presumptive for Agent Orange and PACT Act (burn pit) exposure. Other skin cancers can be claimed with a nexus opinion.

### What if I have scarring from my skin condition?
Scarring can be rated separately under scar codes (DC 7800-7805) if it causes disfigurement or functional impairment.

## Presumptive Skin Conditions

### Agent Orange
- Chloracne (within 1 year of exposure)
- Certain skin cancers

### PACT Act (Burn Pit)
- Certain skin cancers for qualifying veterans
