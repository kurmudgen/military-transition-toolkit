# Colorado Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Colorado offers moderate tax benefits for veterans, with property tax exemptions for 100% disabled veterans and age-based income tax exemptions on military retirement. While not as generous as states like Arizona or Texas, Colorado's benefits—combined with mountain lifestyle and strong military community—make it worth considering if you can handle high housing costs and altitude.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Colorado offers veterans:

- **Military retirement pay**: Partial exemption based on age (under 55: $15K max; ages 55-64: $20K max; ages 65+: $24K max)
- **Property tax exemption**: 50% exemption on first $200,000 of assessed value for 100% disabled veterans
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Vehicle registration**: No special exemption for disabled veterans
- **Hunting/fishing**: Discounted licenses for 100% disabled veterans

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $3,000-$5,000 depending on age, property value, and retirement income.

**Reality check**: Colorado's high cost of living (especially housing in Denver metro) can offset tax savings. You're choosing Colorado for lifestyle and mountains, not tax advantages.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Partial Exemption (Age-Based)

Colorado offers age-based exemptions on military retirement, not the full exemption you'll find in Arizona, Texas, or Florida.

**Under Age 55**:
- Maximum exemption: **$15,000** (tax years 2022-2028)
- On income above $15K, you pay Colorado's 4.40% flat tax

**Ages 55-64**:
- Maximum exemption: **$20,000**
- Applies to pension and annuity income (including military retirement)

**Ages 65 and Older**:
- Maximum exemption: **$24,000**
- Best tier for retirees

**What this means in real dollars**:

**Example 1: E-7 with 20 years, $40,000/year retirement, age 45**
- Exempt: $15,000
- Taxable in Colorado: $25,000
- **State tax owed: $1,100/year** (vs. $0 in Arizona or Texas)

**Example 2: E-7 with 20 years, $40,000/year retirement, age 60**
- Exempt: $20,000
- Taxable in Colorado: $20,000
- **State tax owed: $880/year**

**Example 3: E-7 with 20 years, $40,000/year retirement, age 68**
- Exempt: $24,000
- Taxable in Colorado: $16,000
- **State tax owed: $704/year**

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $171/month for a 10% rating or $4,000+/month for 100% with dependents, you won't pay a dime in taxes on it.

### Active Duty Pay

Active-duty military pay is subject to Colorado income tax. Colorado does not exempt active-duty pay like some states do.

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Colorado operates on a flat income tax system:

- **Flat rate**: 4.40% on all taxable income (as of 2024-2025)

This is higher than Arizona (2.5%) but lower than California (top rate 13.3%).

**Standard deduction**: Follows federal amounts - $13,850 (single), $27,700 (married) for 2025

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Colorado** | Partial (age-based, max $24K) | 4.40% flat | 50% of first $200K |
| Wyoming | N/A | No income tax | No veteran exemption |
| New Mexico | Partial ($10K exempt) | 4.9-5.9% | Up to $4K assessed value |
| Utah | Partial exemption | 4.65% flat | Varies by county |
| Kansas | Varies | 3.1-5.7% | Varies by county |
| Nebraska | Partial ($5K-$15K) | 2.46-5.84% | Up to $50K assessed value |

Colorado sits in the middle - better than New Mexico, worse than Wyoming (no income tax) or Arizona (full military retirement exemption).

## Property Tax Exemptions for Veterans

### Disabled Veterans - 50% Exemption (100% Rating Required)

Colorado offers a property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans, structured as a 50% reduction on the first $200,000 of home value.

**Eligibility requirements** (as of 2025):
- **100% service-connected disability** rated by the VA, OR
- **Individual Unemployability (TDIU)** status (expanded in 2025 via Amendment G)

**Important**: Unlike some states, a 50%, 70%, or 90% disability rating does **NOT** qualify. You must be rated 100% P&T or have TDIU.

#### Real-World Examples

**100% Disabled Veteran in Colorado Springs**
- Home value: $450,000
- Assessed value (7.15% of actual value): $32,175
- Property tax rate: ~0.46% (El Paso County average)
- Property tax without exemption: ~$148/year on assessed value
- **With 50% exemption on first $200K**: Reduces assessed value to $16,088
- **Annual savings: ~$74** (limited because assessed value caps benefit)

**100% Disabled Veteran in Denver**
- Home value: $600,000
- Assessed value: $42,900 (7.15% rate)
- Property tax rate: ~0.55% (Denver average)
- Property tax without exemption: ~$236/year
- **With 50% exemption**: Reduces to ~$118
- **Annual savings: ~$118**

**100% Disabled Veteran in Aurora**
- Home value: $500,000
- Assessed value: $35,750
- Property tax rate: ~0.52%
- Property tax without exemption: ~$186/year
- **With exemption**: ~$93
- **Annual savings: ~$93**

**Reality check**: Colorado's property tax exemption is significantly less valuable than states like Alabama (full exemption) or Arizona (direct dollar reduction). Colorado's residential assessment rate is very low (7.15%), which reduces both the tax burden AND the exemption value.

### How Colorado's Exemption Works

Colorado uses a **50% reduction on the first $200,000 of actual home value**:
1. Take 50% of first $200,000 = $100,000 reduction
2. Apply to actual value before assessment
3. Then apply the 7.15% assessment rate
4. Finally apply local mill levy (property tax rate)

This structure means the benefit is modest compared to other states.

### Income Limits

**2025 income limits**:
- Maximum household income: **$86,700** (adjusted annually)
- Includes wages, interest, dividends, business income
- **Does NOT include**: Social Security, VA disability compensation, certain pensions

This is more generous than Arizona's $38,843 limit.

### Application Process and Deadlines

**Application period**: Varies by county, typically **January through mid-February**

**Required documents**:
- VA disability rating letter showing 100% P&T or TDIU
- DD-214 showing honorable discharge
- Colorado driver's license or state ID
- Property deed
- Income verification (W-2s, 1099s, tax return)

**Where to apply**: Your county assessor's office

**County assessor offices** (major counties):

- **Denver County**: (720) 913-4159
- **El Paso County (Colorado Springs)**: (719) 520-6600
- **Arapahoe County**: (303) 795-4600
- **Jefferson County**: (303) 271-8600
- **Adams County**: (720) 523-6038
- **Boulder County**: (303) 441-3530
- **Larimer County (Fort Collins)**: (970) 498-7050

**Processing time**: Applications must be filed annually. You'll receive confirmation for the current tax year.

**Important**: You must reapply every year. Unlike some states, this is NOT a one-time application.

### 2024 Amendment G Expansion

Colorado voters approved **Amendment G in November 2024**, expanding eligibility to veterans with Individual Unemployability (TDIU) status starting with the 2025 tax year (taxes paid in 2026).

This means veterans rated 60% or higher who receive 100% compensation due to unemployability now qualify.

## Vehicle Registration Benefits

### No Special Exemption for 100% Disabled Veterans

Unlike Arizona, Texas, or Alabama, **Colorado does not offer vehicle registration fee exemptions** for 100% disabled veterans.

**What you'll pay** (Colorado standard rates):
- Registration fees: $7-$75+ depending on vehicle age and weight
- Specific ownership tax: Based on vehicle value, decreases over time
- **No discounts for disabled veterans**

**Annual cost**: $100-$400+ depending on vehicle value

This is a notable disadvantage compared to states with veteran vehicle exemptions.

### Disabled Veteran License Plates

Colorado offers specialized license plates for disabled veterans:
- Disabled Veteran (DV) plates
- Purple Heart plates
- Medal of Honor plates
- Former POW plates

**Fee**: Standard registration fees apply (no discount)

**Parking benefit**: DV plates allow parking in disabled parking spaces (must also have disability placard or documentation)

## Other Financial Benefits

### Hunting and Fishing Licenses

Colorado offers reduced-cost hunting and fishing licenses for disabled veterans:

**100% Permanently and Totally Disabled Veterans**:
- **Annual Fishing License**: $10 (vs. $36 resident)
- **Small Game License**: $21 (vs. $36 resident)
- **Combination license packages**: Various discounts

**Important**: Not free like Arizona, but significant savings

**Application**: Purchase through Colorado Parks and Wildlife with proof of 100% P&T rating

**Contact**: Colorado Parks and Wildlife
**Phone**: (303) 297-1192
**Website**: cpw.state.co.us

### State Parks

**Colorado Aspen Annual Parks Pass** - Free for 100% disabled veterans
- **Cost**: Free (normally $120/year)
- **Benefits**: Unlimited admission to 42+ Colorado State Parks
- **Eligibility**: 100% service-connected disabled veterans

This is one of Colorado's best veteran benefits - free access to world-class outdoor recreation.

**Application**: Apply online or at any Colorado State Park with VA rating letter

### Sales Tax

Colorado does not offer general sales tax exemptions for veterans. Combined state and average local sales tax is approximately **7.8%** (varies by locality).

Some counties (like Denver at 8.81%) have higher rates.

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran retiring in Colorado vs. other states.

### Scenario: E-7 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled, Age 65

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $40,000
- VA disability: $45,000 (100% with dependents)
- Total: $85,000

**Home**: $500,000 (median for Denver metro area)
**Vehicle**: $35,000

### Colorado Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax exemption (50%) | ~$100 | $2,000 |
| Military retirement tax (vs 5% state) | $640 ($24K exempt × 4.40% saved vs full taxation) | $12,800 |
| State parks pass | $120 | $2,400 |
| Hunting/fishing license | $40 | $800 |
| **TOTAL** | **~$900** | **$18,000** |

**Additional costs to consider**:
- Still paying $704/year on military retirement ($16K taxable at 4.40%)
- No vehicle registration exemption ($200-400/year ongoing cost)

### Comparison: Colorado vs. Arizona (Same Scenario)

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Vehicle Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Colorado** | $2,000 | $12,800 | $0 | $18,000 |
| **Arizona** | $94,960 | $40,000 (full exemption) | $9,000 | $147,160 |

**Arizona advantage: $129,160 over 20 years**

Colorado's tax benefits are significantly less generous than Arizona, Texas, or Florida. You're choosing Colorado for lifestyle, not tax savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?

**Yes.** Colorado requires annual applications. You must file between January and mid-February each year (exact dates vary by county).

### What if I'm rated 90% or 70%?

You **do not qualify** for the property tax exemption unless you're 100% P&T or have TDIU (Individual Unemployability) status. This is a major limitation compared to states like Arizona that offer prorated exemptions.

You still benefit from:
- Partial income tax exemption on military retirement (age-based)
- Tax-free VA disability compensation
- Discounted hunting/fishing licenses (50% disabled qualifies for some discounts)

### Can I get the property tax exemption if I exceed the income limits?

No. The income limit is $86,700 for 2025. However, Social Security, VA disability compensation, and certain pension income do NOT count toward this limit, making it easier to qualify than the dollar amount suggests.

### Does TDIU count as 100% for the property tax exemption?

**Yes**, as of 2025 thanks to Amendment G. Veterans with Individual Unemployability status now qualify for the same 50% property tax exemption as veterans rated 100% P&T.

### Are military retirement benefits taxed if I move to Colorado from another state?

Yes, subject to the age-based partial exemption:
- Under 55: $15K exempt, rest taxed at 4.40%
- Ages 55-64: $20K exempt
- Ages 65+: $24K exempt

This applies regardless of where you served or previously lived.

### Do I need to be retired from the military to get these benefits?

- **Property tax exemption**: No, only need 100% VA rating or TDIU
- **Income tax exemption on military retirement**: Yes, must be receiving military retirement pay
- **State parks pass**: No, only need 100% disability rating
- **Hunting/fishing discount**: No, only need VA disability rating

### What if my county denies my exemption application?

Contact:
- **Colorado Division of Veterans Affairs**: (303) 284-6077
- County assessor's office (request appeals process)
- Veteran Service Officers: Available through Colorado DVA

### Does Colorado tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, at Colorado's 4.40% flat rate. Qualified retirement account withdrawals (other than military retirement pension) are taxed as regular income.

However, Colorado offers a pension/annuity subtraction for ages 55-64 ($20K max) and 65+ ($24K max) that may apply to some retirement account distributions.

### Will these benefits affect my federal taxes?

No. Property tax exemptions and state income tax exemptions don't impact your federal tax liability. Military retirement and VA disability compensation remain tax-free at the federal level.

### What happens if I sell my home and buy another in Colorado?

You'll need to reapply for the exemption at your new property. Since you must apply annually anyway, ensure you file by your county's deadline (typically mid-February) after purchasing.

### Can I claim the exemption on a second home or rental property?

No. The exemption applies only to your **primary residence** where you live.

### How does Colorado's cost of living affect the value of these benefits?

**Reality check**: Colorado's high cost of living—especially housing in Denver metro ($585K+ median)—can easily erase tax savings.

**Example**: Moving from Texas (no income tax, affordable housing) to Denver:
- You'll pay $700-1,100/year in state income tax on military retirement
- Housing costs $200K-300K more
- Property tax exemption saves only ~$100/year

**Bottom line**: Choose Colorado for lifestyle (mountains, outdoor recreation, four seasons), not tax benefits. The tax savings are modest at best.

### What's the best age to retire to Colorado for tax purposes?

**Age 65+** offers the maximum benefit:
- $24K military retirement exemption (vs. $15K under 55)
- Medicare eligibility reduces healthcare costs
- Senior property tax programs (beyond veteran exemption)

However, altitude concerns increase with age - discuss with your doctor before moving to 5,000+ feet elevation.

## Key Takeaways

Colorado delivers **moderate** financial value for veterans:

1. **100% disabled veterans** save $900-1,500 annually through combined benefits (modest compared to other states)
2. **Military retirees age 65+** get the best deal with $24K exemption on retirement income
3. **Younger veterans** (under 55) pay more state taxes than in Arizona, Texas, or Florida
4. **Property tax exemption is weak** compared to other states - only ~$100/year savings due to low assessment rate
5. **No vehicle registration exemption** - a notable disadvantage

**Colorado's real benefits**:
- Outstanding outdoor recreation (free state parks pass for 100% disabled)
- Strong military community (Colorado Springs, Denver)
- Quality of life and four-season climate
- Growing defense contractor job market

**Choose Colorado for**: Mountains, outdoor lifestyle, military community, defense jobs
**Don't choose Colorado for**: Tax savings (Arizona, Texas, Florida are far better)

If you're 100% P&T and haven't applied for property tax exemption, do it in January 2025 - but don't expect huge savings. The real value of living in Colorado is lifestyle, not tax breaks.
