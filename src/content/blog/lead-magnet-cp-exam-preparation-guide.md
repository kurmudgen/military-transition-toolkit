## 1. WHAT IS A C&P EXAM AND WHY IT MATTERS

**C&P = Compensation & Pension Exam**

A C&P exam is a medical examination conducted by the VA (or a VA contractor) to evaluate the severity of your service-connected disability. The examiner's report directly influences your VA disability rating.

**Why It Matters:**
- The C&P examiner's findings go directly into your VA claim file
- The rating decision is largely based on the C&P exam results
- **A bad C&P exam can result in a denial or low-ball rating**
- **A good C&P exam can mean the difference between 0% and 100%**

**The Stakes:**
- 10% vs. 30% PTSD = difference of $3,600/year ($300K+ over lifetime)
- 50% vs. 70% back pain = difference of $5,500/year ($165K over 30 years)
- 70% vs. 100% overall = difference of $15,000/year ($450K over 30 years)

**Bottom Line: The C&P exam is the MOST IMPORTANT part of your VA claim. Prepare properly.**

## 2. WHO CONDUCTS C&P EXAMS

### **VA EXAMINERS**

**VA Medical Centers:**
- VA doctors, nurse practitioners, psychologists
- Employed directly by VA
- Conduct exams at VA facilities

**Pros:**
- VA employees understand VA rating criteria
- Familiar with military service-connected conditions

**Cons:**
- Often rushed (15-30 minute exams)
- May be skeptical or dismissive
- Some have reputation for "lowballing" ratings

---

### **CONTRACT EXAMINERS (VES, QTC, LHI)**

The VA contracts with private companies to conduct C&P exams:
- **VES (Veterans Evaluation Services)**
- **QTC (QTC Medical Services)**
- **LHI (Logistics Health Incorporated)**

**These companies:**
- Employ doctors, PAs, NPs, psychologists
- Conduct exams at their own facilities or telehealth
- Account for 50%+ of C&P exams

**Pros:**
- Often faster appointments
- May be more convenient locations
- Some veterans report better experiences

**Cons:**
- Examiners may not be familiar with military or VA rating criteria
- Contracted doctors paid per exam (incentive to rush)
- Quality varies significantly by individual examiner

**Important:** You cannot choose who conducts your exam. The VA assigns you.

---

### **TELEHEALTH C&P EXAMS**

Since COVID, many C&P exams are conducted via video:
- Mental health exams (PTSD, depression, anxiety)
- Some physical exams (if no hands-on assessment needed)

**Pros:**
- More convenient (no travel)
- Can do from home

**Cons:**
- Harder to build rapport with examiner
- Technical issues can cause problems
- Some conditions require in-person exam

---

## 3. WHAT TO EXPECT DURING THE EXAM

### **TYPICAL C&P EXAM STRUCTURE**

**Duration:** 15-45 minutes (varies by condition and examiner)

**Format:**
1. **Review of Medical History** (5-10 minutes)
   - Examiner reviews your medical records
   - Asks about your service history
   - Reviews your claim and symptoms

2. **Interview/Questionnaire** (10-20 minutes)
   - Asks about your symptoms
   - How condition affects daily life
   - Frequency and severity of symptoms
   - Treatment history

3. **Physical Examination** (5-15 minutes) - if applicable
   - Range of motion tests (for joint/back conditions)
   - Neurological tests
   - Observation of gait, posture, etc.

4. **Mental Status Exam** (10-20 minutes) - for mental health
   - Mood, affect, thought process
   - Memory and concentration tests
   - Suicidal ideation screening

5. **DBQ Completion** (examiner fills out after exam)
   - Disability Benefits Questionnaire
   - Standardized form for your condition
   - This is what the VA rater uses to assign your percentage

---

### **WHAT THE EXAMINER IS EVALUATING**

**For Physical Conditions:**
- Range of motion (degrees of movement)
- Pain level (0-10 scale)
- Flare-ups (frequency and duration)
- Functional loss (what you can't do because of condition)
- Need for assistive devices (cane, brace, etc.)

**For Mental Health:**
- Frequency and severity of symptoms
- Impact on occupational functioning
- Impact on social functioning
- Suicidal ideation
- Ability to manage self-care

**Key:** The examiner is looking for **functional impairment**. It's not just about having pain—it's about how that pain affects your life and ability to work.

---

## 4. HOW TO PREPARE: THE 7-DAY ACTION PLAN

### **7 DAYS BEFORE EXAM**

□ **Gather all medical records**
   - Service medical records showing in-service treatment
   - VA medical records
   - Private doctor records
   - Emergency room visits related to condition

□ **Get buddy statements** (if you don't have them yet)
   - Spouse, family, friends describing how your condition affects you
   - Fellow service members who witnessed in-service injury/onset

□ **Review your claim**
   - Re-read what you wrote in your original claim
   - Make sure you remember what symptoms you reported

□ **Write a symptom log**
   - Document your symptoms for the past 30 days
   - Include frequency, severity, flare-ups
   - Note how symptoms affect daily activities

---

### **3 DAYS BEFORE EXAM**

□ **Create a "Worst Day" symptom list**
   - List all symptoms you experience on your WORST days
   - Don't minimize or exaggerate—just be honest about bad days
   - The VA rates you based on your WORST symptoms, not your average

□ **Review VA rating criteria for your condition**
   - Look up the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) for your condition
   - Example: 38 CFR 4.71a for musculoskeletal conditions
   - Understand what symptoms qualify for each rating percentage
   - ecfr.gov (search your condition + "VA rating")

□ **Prepare answers to common questions** (see Section 11 below)

□ **Get a good night's sleep**
   - Avoid alcohol (especially for mental health exams)
   - Eat well, stay hydrated

---

### **DAY OF EXAM**

□ **Bring required documents** (see Section 9)

□ **Arrive 15 minutes early**
   - Shows you're taking it seriously
   - Gives you time to relax and review notes

□ **Dress appropriately**
   - Clean, presentable
   - Not necessary to "dress up" in suit/tie
   - Wear clothes that allow examiner to see/access injured areas if needed

□ **Be honest and detailed**
   - Don't minimize symptoms
   - Don't exaggerate symptoms
   - Describe your WORST days, not your best

□ **Ask for clarification**
   - If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner to rephrase

---

## 5. MENTAL HEALTH C&P EXAMS

### **CONDITIONS EVALUATED**

- PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)
- Major Depressive Disorder
- Anxiety Disorders
- Bipolar Disorder
- Adjustment Disorder
- Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) - mental health component

---

### **WHAT TO EXPECT**

**Mental Status Examination:**
The examiner will assess:
- **Appearance**: Grooming, hygiene, eye contact
- **Mood**: Current emotional state
- **Affect**: Outward emotional expression
- **Thought Process**: Logical, coherent, racing thoughts?
- **Memory**: Short-term and long-term
- **Concentration**: Ability to focus
- **Insight and Judgment**: Awareness of condition, decision-making

**PTSD-Specific Questions:**
- Stressor event (what happened during service)
- Re-experiencing (nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts)
- Avoidance (avoiding people, places, activities)
- Negative mood and cognition (guilt, shame, detachment)
- Hyperarousal (hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, irritability, sleep disturbance)
- Duration and severity

---

### **HOW TO PREPARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH C&P**

**1. Be Honest About Your Worst Days**
- Mental health conditions fluctuate
- Describe your symptoms on **bad weeks**, not just today
- Example: "Most days I have nightmares 3-4 times a week. This week has been better, but last week I had nightmares every night."

**2. Describe Functional Impairment**
Don't just say "I have PTSD." Explain how it affects your life:

**Bad Answer:** "I have PTSD. I get stressed sometimes."

**Good Answer:** "My PTSD causes nightmares 4-5 nights a week, which means I only sleep 3-4 hours a night. I'm exhausted during the day, which makes it hard to focus at work. I avoid crowds because they trigger my hypervigilance—I can't go to movies, concerts, or busy restaurants. I've lost touch with most of my friends because I cancel plans at the last minute when my anxiety is bad. My wife says I'm emotionally distant and irritable."

**3. Bring Examples**
- Lost job due to symptoms
- Ruined relationships
- Can't do activities you used to enjoy
- Medications you've tried and side effects

**4. Don't Minimize**
Many veterans downplay mental health symptoms because of military culture ("suck it up"). The C&P exam is not the time to be tough. Be honest.

**5. Don't Exaggerate**
Examiners are trained to detect malingering (faking symptoms). If you exaggerate, they'll note it and you could get denied.

---

### **MENTAL HEALTH RATING CRITERIA (PTSD)**

VA rates mental health on a General Rating Formula:
- **0%** - Diagnosed condition, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with work/life
- **10%** - Mild symptoms, occasional decrease in work efficiency during periods of stress
- **30%** - Occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks
- **50%** - Reduced reliability and productivity, difficulty with relationships
- **70%** - Deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood) with suicidal ideation, obsessive rituals, near-continuous panic, impaired impulse control, spatial disorientation, neglect of personal hygiene
- **100%** - Total occupational and social impairment

**Key Factors:**
- Occupational impairment (can you work?)
- Social impairment (can you maintain relationships?)
- Suicidal ideation (thoughts of suicide increase rating)
- Hospitalizations (psychiatric hospitalizations heavily weigh toward higher ratings)

---

## 6. PHYSICAL CONDITION C&P EXAMS

### **COMMON PHYSICAL CONDITIONS**

- Back pain (lumbar strain, degenerative disc disease)
- Knee pain (meniscus tear, arthritis)
- Shoulder pain (rotator cuff, labral tear)
- Neck pain
- Hip pain
- Ankle pain
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears)
- Hearing loss
- Sleep apnea
- Migraines

---

### **RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) TESTING**

For joint and back conditions, the examiner will measure your range of motion:

**Example: Lumbar Spine (Lower Back)**
- Forward flexion (bending forward)
- Extension (bending backward)
- Left/right lateral flexion (bending sideways)
- Left/right rotation

**How It's Measured:**
- Goniometer (protractor-like tool)
- Measured in degrees
- Normal ROM varies by joint

**VA Ratings Based on ROM:**
Example: Lumbar Spine
- **Normal ROM**: Forward flexion to 90 degrees
- **10%**: Forward flexion 60-90 degrees OR combined ROM 120-235 degrees
- **20%**: Forward flexion 30-60 degrees OR combined ROM 90-120 degrees
- **30%**: Forward flexion 0-30 degrees OR combined ROM 45-90 degrees
- **40%**: Ankylosis (no movement)

**CRITICAL: The examiner measures ROM on your WORST day, with repeated use**
- They should test ROM multiple times
- ROM should decrease with repeated movements (showing pain/limitation)
- If you're having a good day, tell the examiner: "Today is actually a better day. On my bad days, I can barely bend forward 30 degrees."

---

### **HOW TO PREPARE FOR PHYSICAL C&P EXAM**

**1. Don't Overdo It the Day Before**
- Avoid strenuous activity that might make you feel better than usual
- Don't take extra pain medication before the exam (take your normal dose)
- You want the examiner to see your condition as it normally is

**2. Describe Pain Accurately**
Use the 0-10 pain scale:
- 0 = No pain
- 1-3 = Mild pain (annoying but doesn't interfere with activities)
- 4-6 = Moderate pain (interferes with daily activities)
- 7-9 = Severe pain (unable to function)
- 10 = Worst pain imaginable (ER visit)

**Be specific:**
- "My back pain is usually a 5 out of 10 baseline, but with flare-ups it goes to 8-9."
- "On good days it's a 3, but I'd say 70% of the time it's a 6 or higher."

**3. Explain Flare-Ups**
Most conditions have flare-ups:
- How often? (daily, weekly, monthly)
- How long do they last? (hours, days, weeks)
- What triggers them? (lifting, walking, bending, weather)
- What do you do during flare-ups? (bed rest, ice, medication)

**Example:**
"I have flare-ups about 2-3 times per month where my back pain goes from a 5 to an 8-9. They last 3-5 days. During flare-ups, I can barely walk and I have to lie down most of the day. I take ibuprofen and use a heating pad."

**4. Describe Functional Loss**
What can't you do because of your condition?
- Can't lift more than 20 lbs
- Can't stand for more than 30 minutes
- Can't walk more than 1 mile
- Can't sit for long periods
- Can't play with kids/grandkids
- Can't do hobbies (golf, gardening, etc.)
- Need to take breaks frequently at work

**5. Mention Assistive Devices**
Do you use:
- Cane
- Brace (knee brace, back brace)
- Orthotics (shoe inserts)
- TENS unit
- Ice/heat packs

Using assistive devices shows severity.

---

### **PAIN MEDICATION & TREATMENT**

**Tell the examiner:**
□ All medications you take (name, dose, frequency)
□ Side effects you experience
□ Whether medications help or not
□ Physical therapy (did it help?)
□ Injections (cortisone, epidural, etc.)
□ Surgery (dates, outcome)

**Why this matters:**
- Frequent use of strong pain meds = higher severity
- Treatments that don't work = condition is severe/difficult to treat
- Multiple treatment attempts = condition is persistent

---

## 7. DBQ (DISABILITY BENEFITS QUESTIONNAIRE) EXPLAINED

**What is a DBQ?**
A standardized form the VA created for each medical condition. The C&P examiner fills it out during or after your exam.

**Why it matters:**
The DBQ is the document the VA rater uses to assign your percentage. It's THE most important document in your claim file after your service records.

**What's on a DBQ:**
- Diagnosis (yes/no, what condition)
- Symptoms (checklist)
- Severity (frequency, duration)
- Functional impairment
- Range of motion (for joint/back conditions)
- Nexus (is it related to service? - sometimes)

**Example: DBQ for Knee Condition**

Questions include:
1. Does the veteran have a knee condition? (Yes/No)
2. What is the diagnosis? (Osteoarthritis, meniscus tear, etc.)
3. Range of motion:
   - Flexion (normal: 140 degrees, veteran's: ___ degrees)
   - Extension (normal: 0 degrees, veteran's: ___ degrees)
4. Is there pain on motion? (Yes/No)
5. Is there swelling or effusion? (Yes/No)
6. Does the veteran use a brace or assistive device? (Yes/No)
7. Flare-ups: Frequency and duration?
8. Is the condition related to military service? (At least as likely as not / Less likely than not / Unable to determine)

---

**Can You See Your DBQ?**
- The examiner usually does not share the DBQ with you at the exam
- You can request your C&P exam results after the exam through VA.gov or by calling 1-800-827-1000
- It takes 7-30 days for the DBQ to be uploaded to your file
- **You should ALWAYS request and review your DBQ**
- If there are errors, you can submit a statement correcting them

---

## 8. COMMON MISTAKES THAT LOWER YOUR RATING

### **MISTAKE #1: Saying "I'm doing okay" or "I'm fine"**

**Why it's bad:**
Examiners often ask "How are you doing?" as a greeting. If you say "I'm doing well, thanks!" they may note that you reported feeling fine.

**What to say instead:**
"I'm here for my C&P exam. I've been struggling with [condition]."

---

### **MISTAKE #2: Minimizing Symptoms**

**Example:**
Examiner: "How often do you have pain?"
Veteran: "Oh, not too bad. Maybe a couple times a week."

**Reality:** Veteran has pain daily, but military culture taught them to minimize.

**What you should say:**
"I have pain every day. It's usually a 5-6 out of 10, but flares up to an 8-9 a few times a month."

---

### **MISTAKE #3: Only Describing Your Best Days**

If the examiner catches you on a good day and you say "Today's not too bad," they may rate you based on today rather than your average or worst days.

**What to say:**
"Today is actually a better day. On my worst days, which happen 2-3 times a month, I can barely get out of bed."

---

### **MISTAKE #4: Not Mentioning All Symptoms**

The examiner only knows what you tell them. If you don't mention a symptom, it won't be in the DBQ.

**Example for PTSD:**
Don't just say "I have nightmares." List ALL your symptoms:
- Nightmares 4-5 nights/week
- Flashbacks triggered by loud noises
- Hypervigilance in public
- Avoid crowds
- Irritability and anger outbursts
- Sleep disturbance (insomnia)
- Difficulty concentrating
- Emotional numbness
- Feelings of detachment from family

---

### **MISTAKE #5: Not Bringing Evidence to the Exam**

Bring:
- Copies of medical records (in case examiner doesn't have them)
- Buddy statements
- List of medications
- Symptom log/journal

Hand them to the examiner and say: "I brought some records that document my symptoms. Can I give these to you?"

---

### **MISTAKE #6: Being Hostile or Defensive**

Some examiners are dismissive or rude. Stay calm and professional.

**Bad Response:** "You're not listening to me! The VA always screws veterans!"

**Good Response:** "I feel like my symptoms aren't being fully understood. Can I clarify? On my worst days, my pain is 8-9 out of 10 and I can't work."

---

### **MISTAKE #7: Performing Better Than You Normally Can**

**Example:** Examiner asks you to do a squat to test knee ROM. You push through the pain and do a full squat.

**Result:** Examiner notes "Full ROM, no difficulty with squat."

**What you should do:**
Perform movements as you normally would on an average or bad day. If it hurts, stop. Say: "I can't go further because of the pain."

---

### **MISTAKE #8: Forgetting to Mention Flare-Ups**

VA ratings are based on the frequency and severity of flare-ups, not just your baseline.

Always mention:
- How often flare-ups occur
- How long they last
- What you can't do during flare-ups

---

### **MISTAKE #9: Not Reviewing the Examiner's Notes/DBQ After**

**After your exam:**
1. Request a copy of your C&P exam report (call VA or use VA.gov)
2. Review it for errors
3. If there are mistakes, submit a statement correcting them

**Example Error:**
DBQ says: "Veteran reports pain 1-2 times per week."
Reality: You said "Pain daily, with flare-ups 1-2 times per week."

Submit a statement: "I am correcting the C&P exam report dated [date]. The examiner noted I have pain 1-2 times per week. This is incorrect. I stated I have pain daily at a 5-6 level, with severe flare-ups 1-2 times per week reaching 8-9 pain levels."

---

## 9. WHAT TO BRING TO YOUR C&P EXAM

**Required:**
□ Photo ID (driver's license, military ID)
□ Appointment confirmation letter

**Highly Recommended:**
□ **List of current medications** (name, dose, frequency)
□ **Symptom log** (30-day log of symptoms, pain levels, flare-ups)
□ **Medical records** (bring copies of any records the examiner might not have)
□ **Buddy statements** (if you have them)
□ **List of symptoms** (written list of ALL symptoms so you don't forget during exam)
□ **Notes on functional impairment** (what you can't do because of condition)
□ **Pen and paper** (to take notes during exam if needed)

**Optional But Helpful:**
□ Photos or videos showing limitations (e.g., video of you struggling to bend or walk)
□ Work restrictions from employer
□ Letter from spouse/family describing impact on daily life

---

## 10. AFTER THE EXAM: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

**Timeline:**
1. **Exam completed** (Day 0)
2. **Examiner completes DBQ** (1-7 days after exam)
3. **DBQ sent to VA Regional Office** (7-14 days)
4. **VA Rater reviews claim** (30-90 days)
5. **Decision letter sent** (60-120 days total from exam)

**Note:** Timelines vary. Some claims are decided in 30 days, others take 6-12 months.

---

**What You Should Do:**

**1. Request Copy of C&P Exam Report**
- Call 1-800-827-1000 and ask for your C&P exam results
- OR log into VA.gov and check your claim status (sometimes uploaded there)
- Review for errors

**2. Submit Corrections If Needed**
If the DBQ has errors, submit a statement on VA.gov or via mail correcting the mistakes.

**3. Wait for Decision**
The VA will mail you a decision letter. It will state:
- Whether you're service-connected (yes/no)
- Your rating percentage (0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%)
- Effective date (when back pay starts)
- Monthly compensation amount

**4. If Denied or Low-Balled:**
You have 1 year to file:
- **Supplemental Claim** (submit new evidence)
- **Higher-Level Review** (senior rater reviews, no new evidence)
- **Board Appeal** (appeals to Board of Veterans' Appeals)

---

## 11. SAMPLE C&P EXAM QUESTIONS BY CONDITION

### **PTSD C&P EXAM QUESTIONS**

1. **"Tell me about the traumatic event you experienced during service."**
   - Be specific: Date, location, what happened
   - Keep it brief but clear

2. **"How often do you have nightmares?"**
   - "4-5 nights per week. They're usually about [combat/trauma]. I wake up sweating and can't fall back asleep."

3. **"Do you have flashbacks?"**
   - "Yes, 2-3 times per week. Loud noises like fireworks or cars backfiring trigger them. I'm back in [location] and I freeze up."

4. **"Do you avoid certain places or activities?"**
   - "Yes. I avoid crowds, loud places like concerts or sporting events, and I don't go to fireworks shows. Crowds make me hypervigilant and anxious."

5. **"How does this affect your relationships?"**
   - "My wife says I'm emotionally distant. I don't open up. I canceled plans with friends so often that they stopped inviting me. I've lost most of my friendships."

6. **"Have you had thoughts of suicide?"**
   - **Be honest.** If yes, say yes. If no, say no.
   - "Yes, I've had passive thoughts of suicide—thinking I'd be better off dead—about once a month. I haven't made a plan, but the thoughts are there."

7. **"How does PTSD affect your work?"**
   - "I've been written up twice for irritability with coworkers. I have trouble concentrating, so tasks take longer. I've used all my sick leave because I have days I can't function."

---

### **BACK PAIN C&P EXAM QUESTIONS**

1. **"Describe your back pain."**
   - "I have constant lower back pain, usually a 5-6 out of 10. It shoots down my left leg (sciatica). With flare-ups, it's 8-9 pain and I can barely walk."

2. **"How often do you have flare-ups?"**
   - "2-3 times per month, lasting 3-5 days each. They're triggered by lifting, bending, or sometimes just sleeping wrong."

3. **"What can't you do because of your back?"**
   - "I can't lift more than 20 lbs. I can't stand for more than 30 minutes. I can't sit for long car rides. I can't play with my kids or do yardwork."

4. **"What treatments have you tried?"**
   - "I take ibuprofen daily. I've done physical therapy twice—it helped temporarily but pain came back. I had an epidural steroid injection last year, which helped for 3 months. I use a TENS unit and heating pad daily."

5. **"Do you use any assistive devices?"**
   - "Yes, I wear a back brace when I'm going to be on my feet. I also sleep with a special pillow."

---

### **KNEE PAIN C&P EXAM QUESTIONS**

1. **"When did your knee pain start?"**
   - "It started during basic training after a ruck march. I reported it to sick call [check your service records]. It's gotten worse since then."

2. **"Describe the pain."**
   - "Sharp, stabbing pain on the inside of my right knee. It hurts when I walk, climb stairs, or squat. It's usually a 6 out of 10, but flares to 8 when I overuse it."

3. **"Does your knee give out or lock up?"**
   - "Yes, my knee gives out (buckles) 1-2 times a week when I'm walking. It locks up occasionally where I can't fully straighten it."

4. **"Do you use a brace or cane?"**
   - "Yes, I wear a knee brace whenever I'm walking more than a few blocks. I use a cane on bad days."

---

### **TINNITUS (RINGING IN EARS) C&P EXAM**

**Note:** Tinnitus is rated at 10% if present. There's no higher rating. The exam is simple.

1. **"Do you have ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears?"**
   - "Yes, constant high-pitched ringing in both ears, 24/7."

2. **"When did it start?"**
   - "Started during service due to [weapons fire / aircraft noise / explosions]."

3. **"How does it affect your life?"**
   - "It makes it hard to hear conversations, especially in noisy environments. It keeps me awake at night. I have to use a white noise machine to sleep."

**That's it. If you have tinnitus, you get 10%.**

---

## 12. WHEN TO GET A NEXUS LETTER OR IMO

**Nexus Letter = Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)**

A letter from a private doctor stating your condition is "at least as likely as not" related to your military service.

**When You Need One:**

1. **VA examiner says "Not service-connected"**
   - If the C&P examiner's DBQ states your condition is "less likely than not" related to service, get a nexus letter to counter it.

2. **You have a gap in treatment**
   - If you didn't seek treatment for years after service, a nexus letter can explain the connection.

3. **Your condition is not clearly documented in service**
   - If you didn't report it during service, a nexus letter from a doctor can explain how it started in service even without documentation.

4. **Secondary conditions**
   - Example: Your service-connected knee pain caused you to walk differently, which caused hip and back pain. A nexus letter can link the secondary conditions.

**Cost:**
- $500-$2,000+ depending on complexity and doctor

**Where to Get:**
- Private doctors (civilian specialists)
- DBQ-specific companies: Nexus Letter Doctor, Veterans Disability Help, Elite Medical Opinions

**What It Should Say:**
"It is at least as likely as not (50% or more probability) that the veteran's [condition] is related to their military service because [reasons]."
