# VA DBQ Forms Explained: What Examiners Are Filling Out (2025)

When you attend a C&P exam, the examiner fills out a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). This standardized form captures the medical findings that determine your rating.

Understanding DBQs helps you prepare for exams and review results for accuracy. Here's what you need to know.

## What Is a DBQ?

A Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) is a standardized medical form used to evaluate VA disability claims. Each condition has its own DBQ with specific questions designed to capture the information needed for rating.

### Purpose of DBQs

1. **Standardize evaluations** - Same questions regardless of examiner
2. **Capture rating criteria** - Directly addresses what the rating schedule requires
3. **Ensure completeness** - Checklist format reduces missed information
4. **Facilitate rating decisions** - VA raters can quickly find needed information

### Who Completes DBQs

- **VA examiners** at C&P exams
- **Contract examiners** (QTC, VES, LHI)
- **Private physicians** (you can submit private DBQs for some conditions)

## Types of DBQs

There are over 70 different DBQ forms covering various conditions:

### Common DBQs

| Condition | DBQ Form Number |
|-----------|-----------------|
| PTSD | 21-0960P-3 |
| Mental Disorders (other) | 21-0960P-2 |
| Back (thoracolumbar spine) | 21-0960M-14 |
| Neck (cervical spine) | 21-0960M-13 |
| Knee | 21-0960M-9 |
| Shoulder | 21-0960M-12 |
| Sleep Apnea | 21-0960N-1 |
| GERD/Hiatal Hernia | 21-0960G-2 |
| Hearing Loss | 21-0960A-1 |
| Tinnitus | 21-0960A-2 |
| Hypertension | 21-0960A-4 |
| Diabetes | 21-0960E-1 |

## What's on a DBQ: Breaking Down Key Sections

### 1. Veteran Information
- Name, Social Security Number
- Examiner information
- Date of examination

### 2. Diagnosis Section
The examiner documents:
- Current diagnosis (ICD code)
- Date of diagnosis
- How diagnosis was established

**Why it matters:** Without a confirmed diagnosis, you can't be service-connected.

### 3. Medical History
- How/when condition began
- Treatment history
- Current symptoms

**Why it matters:** Establishes chronology and supports service connection.

### 4. Current Symptoms
Specific questions vary by condition but typically include:
- Description of symptoms
- Frequency and severity
- Impact on daily activities

**Why it matters:** Directly affects your rating level.

### 5. Physical Examination Findings
For musculoskeletal DBQs:
- Range of motion measurements (in degrees)
- Pain on movement
- Tenderness, swelling
- After repetitive use testing
- Flare-up assessment

For mental health DBQs:
- Occupational and social impairment level (checkboxes)
- Specific symptoms present (checkboxes)
- Behavioral observations

**Why it matters:** These findings determine your percentage rating.

### 6. Functional Impact
Questions about how the condition affects:
- Work/employment
- Daily activities
- Physical and sedentary work

**Why it matters:** Supports TDIU claims and overall impairment assessment.

### 7. Nexus Opinion (for service connection)
The examiner provides an opinion:
- Is condition at least as likely as not related to service?
- Rationale for opinion

**Why it matters:** Determines whether you get service-connected at all.

## Example: What's on the PTSD DBQ

### Section I: Diagnosis
- [ ] PTSD
- [ ] Other anxiety disorder
- [ ] Depressive disorder
- [ ] Other (specify)

### Section II: Stressor Information
Description of traumatic event(s)
- Fear of hostile military activity
- Combat
- MST
- Other

### Section III: Symptoms
Checklist of PTSD symptoms:
- Intrusive memories
- Nightmares
- Flashbacks
- Avoidance
- Negative alterations in cognition
- Hyperarousal symptoms
- Etc.

### Section IV: Occupational and Social Impairment
**This is the key section for rating:**

- [ ] No mental disorder diagnosis
- [ ] Mental disorder diagnosed but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with functioning
- [ ] Occupational and social impairment due to mild symptoms (10%)
- [ ] Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency (30%)
- [ ] Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity (50%)
- [ ] Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (70%)
- [ ] Total occupational and social impairment (100%)

**Which box is checked largely determines your rating.**

### Section V: Nexus Opinion
Is it at least as likely as not that the veteran's mental condition is caused by military service?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- Rationale:

## Example: What's on the Back DBQ

### Range of Motion Testing
The examiner must document:

**Initial:**
- Forward flexion: ___° (normal: 90°)
- Extension: ___° (normal: 30°)
- Right lateral flexion: ___° (normal: 30°)
- Left lateral flexion: ___° (normal: 30°)
- Right rotation: ___° (normal: 30°)
- Left rotation: ___° (normal: 30°)

**Pain noted on exam?**
- [ ] Yes (at what degree?)
- [ ] No

**After 3 repetitions:**
- Any additional loss of motion?
- Any additional functional loss?

**Flare-ups:**
- Does veteran report flare-ups?
- If yes, examiner must estimate functional loss during flare-ups

### IVDS Section
- [ ] Veteran has IVDS
- [ ] Has incapacitating episodes requiring bed rest prescribed by physician

### Neurological Findings
- [ ] Signs of radiculopathy?
- Which nerve affected?
- Severity (mild/moderate/severe)

## How DBQ Findings Translate to Ratings

### For Spine Conditions:

| DBQ Finding | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| Forward flexion > 60° | 10% |
| Forward flexion 30°-60° | 20% |
| Forward flexion ≤ 30° | 40% |

**But remember:** Pain can limit functional flexion below physical capability.

### For Mental Health Conditions:

| DBQ Finding | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| "Occasional decrease in work efficiency" | 30% |
| "Reduced reliability and productivity" | 50% |
| "Deficiencies in most areas" | 70% |
| "Total occupational and social impairment" | 100% |

The checkbox the examiner selects essentially determines your rating.

## How to Use This Knowledge

### Before Your Exam

**Understand what the examiner needs to document:**
- For musculoskeletal: Range of motion, pain on movement, flare-ups
- For mental health: Specific symptoms, occupational/social impairment level
- For all: Service connection nexus

**Prepare to provide information that helps fill out the DBQ accurately:**
- Know your symptoms in DBQ terms
- Be ready to describe flare-ups
- Explain functional impact on work and daily life

### During Your Exam

**Help the examiner complete the DBQ accurately:**
- Mention symptoms that correspond to DBQ categories
- Describe your worst days (affects flare-up assessment)
- Explain functional limitations (affects severity determination)
- For ROM testing, stop where pain begins (affects documented limitation)

### After Your Exam

**Request a copy of your DBQ:**
You can get this through:
- VA medical records request
- Asking your VSO
- VA.gov records access

**Review for accuracy:**
- Are ROM measurements correct?
- Are all symptoms documented?
- Is the impairment level checkbox accurate?
- Is the nexus opinion reasonable?

**If you find errors:**
- File a Supplemental Claim with evidence contradicting the DBQ
- Get a private DBQ from your own doctor
- Request Higher Level Review for clear errors

## Private DBQs

### Can You Submit Your Own DBQ?

For some conditions, yes. You can have your private physician complete a DBQ and submit it with your claim.

**Benefits:**
- Avoids VA exam scheduling delays
- Your doctor knows your condition well
- May be more thorough

**Limitations:**
- VA may still order their own exam
- Private DBQs may not be accepted for all conditions
- VA examiner opinion may differ

### How to Get a Private DBQ

1. Download the appropriate DBQ form from VA.gov
2. Ask your doctor to complete it thoroughly
3. Ensure all sections are filled out
4. Submit with your claim or supplemental evidence

### Which Conditions Allow Private DBQs?

VA policy has changed over time. Currently, private DBQs are accepted for many conditions. Check VA.gov or ask your VSO for current guidance.

## Common DBQ Issues to Watch For

### 1. Incomplete Flare-Up Assessment
The examiner must estimate functional loss during flare-ups, even if they don't observe one.

### 2. ROM Without Pain Notation
Pain on movement should be documented. Physical ROM without pain consideration doesn't capture functional limitation.

### 3. Wrong Severity Level for Mental Health
The impairment checkbox should reflect your overall picture, not just how you presented on exam day.

### 4. Cursory Nexus Opinion
A simple "No" without rationale is insufficient. The examiner must explain their reasoning.

### 5. Missing Secondary Condition Assessment
If you have radiculopathy with back problems, it should be noted in the neurological section.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I see the DBQ before the rating decision?
Yes. Request your exam records through VA.

### Can I dispute a DBQ?
Yes, through appeals. Submit evidence contradicting inaccurate findings.

### Are DBQs public?
The blank forms are available online. Your completed DBQ is part of your confidential medical records.

### Do I need to know DBQ forms to file a claim?
No, but understanding them helps you prepare for exams.

### Can a DBQ be amended?
The examiner can file an addendum if there was an error. You can request this through your claims process.

## Bottom Line

DBQs are the standardized forms that capture C&P exam findings. Understanding what's on them helps you:
- Prepare for exams effectively
- Communicate relevant information
- Review results for accuracy
- Appeal unfavorable findings

When you know what the examiner needs to document, you can help ensure the DBQ accurately reflects your condition.
