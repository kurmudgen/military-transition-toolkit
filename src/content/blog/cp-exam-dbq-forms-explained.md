# VA DBQ Forms Explained: What Examiners Are Filling Out

## Bottom Line Up Front

During your C&P exam, the examiner completes a **Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)**—a standardized form that directly determines your VA rating. Understanding what's on the DBQ for your condition helps you ensure the examiner captures all relevant information. The DBQ is essentially a checklist that translates your symptoms into rating criteria. If something isn't on the DBQ, it might not factor into your rating. This guide explains how DBQs work and what you need to know.

## What Is a DBQ?

A Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) is a standardized medical form the VA uses to evaluate specific conditions. There are over 70 different DBQs covering everything from PTSD to knee conditions to sleep apnea.

**Key facts about DBQs:**
- Each condition has its own specific DBQ
- The DBQ contains questions that map directly to rating criteria
- C&P examiners fill out DBQs during or after your exam
- The completed DBQ becomes part of your claims file
- VA raters use the DBQ to determine your percentage

**Why DBQs matter:** If the examiner doesn't check a box or fill in a field on the DBQ, that information won't be considered for your rating—even if you told them about it.

## How DBQs Determine Ratings

Here's the connection between DBQs and ratings:

1. **Rating criteria** are in the Code of Federal Regulations (38 CFR Part 4)
2. **DBQ questions** are designed to capture information needed to apply those criteria
3. **Examiner answers** on the DBQ determine which criteria you meet
4. **VA rater** uses the completed DBQ to assign your percentage

**Example - Knee Conditions:**

The knee DBQ asks about range of motion. The rating criteria say:
- Flexion limited to 45 degrees = 10%
- Flexion limited to 30 degrees = 20%
- Flexion limited to 15 degrees = 30%

If the examiner measures your flexion at 40 degrees and writes that on the DBQ, you get 10%.

If they measure 25 degrees, you get 20%.

The DBQ answer directly determines the rating.

## Common DBQ Sections

Most DBQs contain these standard sections:

### 1. Diagnosis
- Current diagnosis
- Date of diagnosis
- How condition was diagnosed

**What you should ensure:** Your condition is correctly named and diagnosed. An incorrect diagnosis can affect your claim.

### 2. Medical History
- When condition began
- In-service events
- Treatment history
- Current treatment

**What you should ensure:** The examiner has the full picture of your condition's history, especially anything connecting it to service.

### 3. Current Symptoms
- List of symptoms
- Frequency
- Severity

**What you should ensure:** All your symptoms are captured, not just the main ones.

### 4. Physical Examination Findings
- Range of motion (musculoskeletal)
- Test results
- Observed limitations

**What you should ensure:** The examiner performs all required tests and accurately records results.

### 5. Functional Impact
- Effect on work
- Effect on daily activities

**What you should ensure:** The examiner documents how your condition affects your ability to function—this is critical for higher ratings.

### 6. Additional Factors (for musculoskeletal)
- Pain with motion
- Flare-ups
- Fatigability
- Incoordination

**What you should ensure:** Flare-ups and DeLuca factors are addressed. If not asked, bring them up.

### 7. Medical Opinion (for service connection)
- Is condition related to service?
- Rationale

**What you should ensure:** For initial claims, this is where the examiner states whether your condition is connected to service.

## DBQs for Common Conditions

### Knee and Lower Leg DBQ

**What it captures:**
- Diagnosis (degenerative arthritis, meniscus condition, instability, etc.)
- Range of motion (flexion and extension, in degrees)
- Pain with motion
- Results after repetitive use
- Flare-up severity and additional limitation

### Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ

**What it captures:**
- Audiometric test results (puretone thresholds)
- Speech discrimination scores
- Tinnitus presence
- Functional impact of hearing loss/tinnitus

**Critical sections for rating:**
| DBQ Question | Rating Impact |
|--------------|---------------|

| Tinnitus confirmed | Automatic 10% for tinnitus |

**What to ensure:**
- Testing is performed correctly
- If you have tinnitus, it's documented

## How to Use DBQ Knowledge in Your Exam

### Before the Exam
1. **Find the DBQ for your condition** at [VA Forms](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/) (search "DBQ")
2. **Review the questions** to understand what will be evaluated
3. **Prepare to address each section** with relevant information

### During the Exam
1. **Ensure the examiner addresses all DBQ sections**
2. **Volunteer information** for sections they might skip (especially flare-ups)
3. **Ask questions** if something seems missed: "Are you going to document my flare-ups?" or "Will you note my use of assistive devices?"

### After the Exam
1. **Request a copy of the completed DBQ** through your VA.gov account or by contacting VA
2. **Review for accuracy and completeness**
3. **If something's wrong or missing,** this is grounds for appeal or request for new exam

## Private DBQs

Veterans can have private doctors complete DBQs, though the VA's acceptance of private DBQs has varied over time.

**Current status (as of 2024-2025):**
- VA may accept private DBQs as supporting evidence
- Private DBQs are not a substitute for a VA-ordered C&P exam for initial claims
- Private DBQs can be valuable for appeals and supplemental claims
- Private DBQs should be completed by doctors qualified in the relevant specialty

**When to use a private DBQ:**
- To counter an unfavorable VA exam
- To document condition severity between exams
- To support an increase claim
- As part of a supplemental claim with new evidence

## Common DBQ Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Examiner Didn't Assess Flare-Ups

**Impact:** Rating based only on current range of motion, not worst-case limitation

**Solution:**
- Proactively describe flare-ups during exam
- State: "I want to make sure you document my flare-ups. They occur [frequency] and cause approximately [X] additional degrees of limitation."
- If omitted, get private DBQ or medical opinion documenting flare-ups

### Problem: Examiner Marked Wrong Impairment Level (Mental Health)

**Impact:** Major—this is the primary rating factor for PTSD/mental health

**Solution:**
- Review the DBQ after receiving your rating decision
- If impairment level is wrong, file Higher-Level Review or Supplemental Claim
- Get private mental health evaluation supporting correct impairment level

### Problem: Examiner Didn't Assess Instability (Knee)

**Impact:** Missing separate rating for instability (10-30%)

**Solution:**
- During exam: "Are you going to test my knee stability? My knee gives way regularly."
- If missed: Request new exam or get private DBQ with stability testing

### Problem: Examiner Gave Negative Nexus Opinion

**Impact:** Service connection denied

**Solution:**
- Review the rationale
- Get a private medical opinion (nexus letter) contradicting the examiner
- File Supplemental Claim with the new opinion

## DBQ Red Flags to Watch For

When reviewing your completed DBQ, watch for:

1. **Incomplete sections** - Any blank areas that should have been addressed
2. **Boilerplate language** - Generic responses that don't reflect your specific exam
3. **Inconsistencies** - Findings that don't match what happened during the exam
4. **Missing flare-up assessment** - Musculoskeletal DBQs should address this
5. **No functional impact noted** - Should describe how condition affects work/life
6. **Negative nexus with poor rationale** - Opinion without adequate explanation

## Key Takeaways

1. **DBQs directly determine ratings** - The form matters as much as the exam
2. **Know your DBQ** - Review the form for your condition before your exam
3. **Ensure completeness** - Make sure all relevant sections are addressed
4. **Volunteer information** - Don't wait to be asked about flare-ups or functional impact
5. **Review afterward** - Request and check the completed DBQ for accuracy
6. **Use private DBQs strategically** - They can support appeals and supplemental claims

The DBQ is the blueprint for your rating. Understanding it gives you power to ensure your exam captures your true condition.
