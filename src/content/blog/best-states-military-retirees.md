# Best States for Military Retirees 2025: Tax-Free Living and VA Healthcare Access

Where you retire matters. Not just for the weather or being near family, but for how much of your retirement pay you actually keep.

Some states will let you keep every dollar of your military retirement pay. Others will tax it like regular income and take a 5-7% cut every month for the rest of your life.

Over a 30-year retirement, that difference could be $50,000-$100,000+.

Then there's cost of living, VA healthcare access, property taxes, military retiree communities, and whether your spouse can find decent work.

This guide ranks the best states for military retirees based on real financial impact - not just "nice weather and beaches." I'll show you exactly what you'll pay in taxes, what cost of living really looks like, and where VA facilities are actually accessible.

## What Makes a State Good for Military Retirees?

Let's be clear about what matters:

### 1. Tax Treatment of Military Retirement Pay
Some states don't tax it at all. Some tax it fully. This is the biggest financial factor.

### 2. Cost of Living
A state with no income tax doesn't help if your rent is $3,000/month. We need to look at the full picture.

### 3. VA Healthcare Access
If you're relying on VA healthcare, you need to be near a VA facility. Rural states with no VA hospitals aren't great, even if taxes are low.

### 4. Property Tax and Other Taxes
Some states make up for no income tax with brutal property taxes (looking at you, Texas). Others have high sales taxes.

### 5. Military Retiree Community
Are there jobs for military retirees? Are there other vets around? Do employers understand military experience?

### 6. Quality of Life Factors
Employment opportunities for spouses, schools, crime rates, climate, and overall livability.
