**Evidence Needed:**
- Documentation of traumatic brain injury event during service
- Medical diagnosis of TBI (acute and residual effects)
- Neurological examination and cognitive testing
- Documentation of residual symptoms and their severity
- Nexus linking current symptoms to service-connected TBI
- Treatment records showing ongoing symptoms
- Personal and lay statements describing functional impact

**Average Monthly Compensation (2025 rates, veteran without dependents):**

## Understanding TBI VA Ratings

TBI is unique in VA rating. The initial TBI is rated temporarily after injury, but long-term ratings are based on residual conditions. Under 38 CFR § 4.124a, TBI residuals are evaluated across ten categories of impairment.

### How TBI Ratings Work

**Immediate Post-Injury Rating:**
- 100% for 3 months following hospital discharge
- Then re-evaluation based on ongoing symptoms

**Long-Term Rating - Based on Residual Symptoms:**
TBI residuals are rated from 0% to 100% based on severity across 10 categories:
1. Memory, attention, concentration, executive functions
2. Judgment
3. Social interaction
4. Orientation
5. Motor activity (control of movement)
6. Visual spatial orientation
7. Subjective symptoms (headaches, dizziness, fatigue, etc.)
8. Neurobehavioral effects
9. Communication
10. Consciousness

- Filed for TBI residuals and secondary conditions

**Result:** TBI residuals rated 70% ($1,759.19/month), plus separate ratings for depression (50%) and headaches (30%). Combined rating 91%, rounds to 100% for pay.

**Key Factors:** Objective evidence (imaging, neuropsych testing), employment impact, comprehensive secondary claims.

### Case Study 3: Initially Denied, Won on Appeal - 40% Rating
**Background:** Marine Corps veteran, "got his bell rung" in blast, no documented loss of consciousness, ongoing symptoms denied initially.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability for TBI if I don't remember the injury?
Yes. Memory loss around the time of injury (post-traumatic amnesia) is actually a symptom of TBI. Service medical records, buddy statements, and circumstantial evidence can establish the injury occurred.

### Do I need to have lost consciousness to have a TBI?
No. While loss of consciousness is common, TBI can be diagnosed with alteration of mental state (confusion, disorientation, "seeing stars") without full loss of consciousness.

### What if my TBI wasn't diagnosed until years after service?
You can still file. If you can establish that a head injury occurred during service (even if not diagnosed as TBI at the time) and a medical professional now diagnoses TBI with residuals, you may be service-connected.

### Can I get separate ratings for TBI and its residual symptoms?
Yes. TBI residuals are rated as one evaluation, but specific conditions (headaches, depression, tinnitus, etc.) can be rated separately as secondary to TBI.

### How important is neuropsychological testing?
Very important, especially for cognitive residuals. Neuropsych testing provides objective evidence of impairment that supports your subjective complaints.

### What if my TBI is from a blast but I wasn't diagnosed at the time?
Many blast TBI cases were not diagnosed during service, especially in earlier conflicts. Current diagnosis by a qualified professional, combined with evidence of blast exposure, can establish service connection.

### Will my TBI rating be reduced if I improve?
Ratings can be reduced if your condition improves. However, many TBI residuals are permanent. Continue treatment and document ongoing symptoms.

### Can I get 100% for TBI alone?
Yes, if residual symptoms are severe enough across multiple functional categories. However, most 100% TBI cases involve the TBI rating combined with secondary conditions.

### What if VA says my symptoms are from PTSD, not TBI?
This is common. PTSD and TBI have overlapping symptoms. You may have both. Get evaluations from both mental health and neurology specialists. Both conditions can be service-connected.

### How do I prove a TBI event if there's no documentation?
Buddy statements, circumstantial evidence (combat records showing you were in blast area), indirect evidence (service medical records showing headaches, dizziness after suspected injury), and your own statement. Lack of documentation doesn't mean it didn't happen.

### Can I work and still get TBI disability?
Yes, unless claiming TDIU. However, your work capacity affects your rating. Document any accommodations you need or work limitations.

### What if I have multiple head injuries from service?
All can contribute to your current TBI condition. Document all incidents. Cumulative effects may be considered.

### Should I claim TBI or post-concussion syndrome?
VA generally rates persistent symptoms from head injury as TBI residuals, regardless of whether it's called TBI, post-concussion syndrome, or another term. Focus on documenting symptoms and functional impact.

### Can TBI cause personality changes?
Yes, and this is ratable. Personality changes from TBI can be rated under neurobehavioral effects or as a separate mental health condition secondary to TBI.

## Final Thoughts

Traumatic Brain Injury can have profound, lifelong effects on veterans. If you experienced a head injury during service and have ongoing symptoms, you deserve evaluation and compensation.

**Keys to a Successful TBI Claim:**

1. **Document the injury event** - Even without perfect records
2. **Get comprehensive evaluation** - Neuropsychological testing is critical
3. **Document all residual symptoms** - Across all 10 functional categories
4. **Claim all secondary conditions** - Headaches, depression, anxiety, etc.
5. **Show functional impact** - Specific examples of work and life limitations
6. **Don't give up** - TBI claims are complex but winnable
7. **Get expert help** - VSO, attorney, private medical opinions

**Remember:** Many TBI cases were not properly diagnosed during service, especially blast TBI. Current symptoms and proper evaluation can establish service connection even without perfect service documentation.

TBI is not always visible, but its effects are real. You earned these benefits through your service and sacrifice.
