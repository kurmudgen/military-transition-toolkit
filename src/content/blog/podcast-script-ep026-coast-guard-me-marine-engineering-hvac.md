[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** Machinery Technician. Diesel engines, HVAC systems, hydraulics, shipboard machinery. Your expertise translates - HVAC at sixty thousand, marine engineering at eighty thousand, industrial maintenance at ninety thousand plus.

[MAIN CONTENT]

**Your ME Skills:** Diesel engine maintenance, HVAC/refrigeration systems, hydraulics, propulsion systems, auxiliary machinery, troubleshooting, preventive maintenance. Shipboard experience civilians don't have.

**Career Paths:**

**HVAC Technician:** Commercial/residential systems. $59,810 median 2024. Your CG refrigeration/HVAC experience transfers directly. EPA 608 certification required (easy for MEs).

**Marine HVAC Technician:** Shipboard HVAC systems - commercial vessels, cruise ships, maritime facilities. $55K-$79K. Your exact CG experience. Maritime industry understands your value.

**Marine Engineer (Vessels):** Commercial vessels, merchant marine, cruise ships, offshore platforms. $80K-$120K+. Requires Merchant Mariner Credential but CG sea time counts toward requirements. Natural transition.

**Industrial Maintenance Technician:** Manufacturing facilities, power plants, industrial operations. $62K-$99K. Your machinery troubleshooting and hydraulics experience valued.

**Refrigeration Technician:** Commercial refrigeration systems - supermarkets, warehouses, food processing. $55K-$75K. EPA 608 Universal required. Your CG refrigeration training applies directly.

**Facilities Engineer:** Building systems management - HVAC, mechanical, electrical. $65K-$90K. Combines your technical skills with facility operations.

**Diesel Mechanic:** Heavy equipment, marine engines, power generation. $50K-$70K. Your diesel experience from CG cutters/boats transfers.

**Power Plant Operator:** Utility/industrial power generation. $75K-$95K. Your propulsion and auxiliary systems experience relevant.

**Required Certifications:**

**EPA 608 Universal:** Required for all HVAC/refrigeration work with refrigerants. Four types - Type I (small appliances), Type II (high-pressure), Type III (low-pressure), Universal (all types). Get Universal. $150-$300, self-study online, never expires. Your CG training covers most material.

**Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC):** Required for commercial vessel work. Your CG sea time and ME experience count toward requirements. Significantly reduces time/cost to obtain.

**NATE Certification:** North American Technician Excellence - HVAC industry standard. Not required but increases pay. $65 per specialty test.

**ME Advantage:** Your shipboard machinery experience unique. Civilian HVAC techs don't understand marine systems or work in challenging environments. You troubleshoot under pressure, work independently, understand complex integrated systems. Employers recognize CG technical training quality.

**Timeline:** 12mo out research target industry (marine vs commercial HVAC vs industrial), obtain EPA 608 (2-4 weeks study), 6-9mo apply positions emphasizing CG machinery experience, 3-6mo interview and potentially start before separation.

**Industry Considerations:**

Marine engineering - requires Merchant Mariner Credential, jobs concentrated coastal ports, higher pay, your CG experience most valued here.

Commercial HVAC - EPA 608 required, jobs everywhere, consistent demand, good work-life balance, union options available.

Industrial maintenance - manufacturing/power generation, higher pay, shift work common, values your troubleshooting skills.

**Geographic Flexibility:** HVAC jobs everywhere - every city needs HVAC techs. Marine engineering coastal only. Industrial depends on manufacturing locations. Your skills portable.

**Starting Strategy:** Get EPA 608 Universal immediately (cheap, easy, required). Then decide marine vs commercial HVAC vs industrial. Marine pays more but location-limited. Commercial HVAC most flexible, strong demand everywhere. Nine percent job growth 2023-2033, 42,500 openings yearly.
