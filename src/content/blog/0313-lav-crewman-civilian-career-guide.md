## Bottom Line Up Front

0313 LAV Crewman brings a unique combination of **vehicle operations, mechanical maintenance, weapons systems, and tactical operations experience**—skills that translate directly to heavy equipment operation, diesel mechanics, CDL trucking, law enforcement, and security. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$65,000** for entry-level positions, with experienced professionals hitting **$75,000-$95,000+** in specialized mechanical roles, CDL operations, or law enforcement. Your LAV experience gives you dual pathways: the mechanical/vehicle operations side or the tactical/law enforcement side. Pick your lane and run with it.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 0313 who starts researching civilian careers hears the same thing: "LAV Crewman? What's that?" Most civilians have no clue what you did. HR departments see "light armored vehicle" and their eyes glaze over.

Here's what they're missing: **you operated and maintained an eight-wheeled, 25mm cannon-equipped reconnaissance vehicle in combat conditions.**

You didn't just drive around. You:
- Operated complex armored reconnaissance vehicles in high-threat environments
- Performed first echelon maintenance on diesel-powered vehicles worth millions
- Maintained weapons systems including 25mm chain gun and machine guns
- Executed reconnaissance and security missions requiring tactical judgment
- Worked as part of a crew under extreme pressure
- Troubleshot mechanical and weapons system failures in the field
- Maintained accountability for vehicles, weapons, and equipment
- Obtained and maintained government vehicle operator licenses

That's heavy equipment operation, diesel mechanics, gunnery, tactical operations, and leadership. Those skills are valuable. You just need to translate them into terms civilians understand and target industries that need what you bring.

- **CDL** (for some vehicle operations roles)

**Reality check:**
Federal jobs offer job security, excellent benefits, pension eligibility, and clear pay progression through the GS scale. Veteran preference (5-10 points) significantly improves your hiring chances.

The hiring process is slow—6-12 months is common. Federal background checks are thorough. Be patient.

Your government motor vehicle licensing from LAV operations gives you a leg up for federal vehicle operations and logistics positions. Your security experience applies to law enforcement roles.

**Best for:** 0313s who want federal benefits, job security, and a clear career progression path.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "LAV Crewman" on your resume. Civilians have no idea what that means. Here's how to translate:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| LAV driver/operator | Operated complex armored vehicles requiring precision control and navigation |
| LAV crew member | Coordinated with 3-person crew to execute reconnaissance missions |
| First echelon maintenance | Performed preventive maintenance and troubleshooting on diesel vehicles |
