## Success Stories

**Lisa, Navy Spouse - IT Project Manager**
"I spent years feeling like coordinating our family's moves and running FRG events wasn't 'real' work. Then I documented all that experience for my PMP application—PMI accepted 4,500 hours. I passed the PMP, applied to 50 remote positions, and got hired by a healthcare tech company at $95K. When we PCS'd to Japan, I kept the same job. I just shifted my meetings to early morning."

**Michael, Air Force Spouse - Program Manager**
"I had a business degree but couldn't use it at three consecutive duty stations. After our fourth move, I got my PMP. That certification opened doors immediately. I started as a project coordinator at $55K, moved to project manager at $78K, and now I'm a program manager at $115K—all remote. My career no longer restarts when we move."

**Aisha, Army Spouse - Scrum Master**
"Traditional project management felt too rigid for my personality. I got my CSM (Scrum Master) certification and focused on tech companies. Now I lead an agile team at a software company, fully remote. The daily standups happen at 9am regardless of where I'm stationed. I've worked through two PCS moves and a deployment without missing a beat."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "I don't have enough project management experience"
**Solution:** You likely have more than you think. Document your military spouse experiences using PM terminology. FRG events, volunteer work, and even running a household during deployment count. Alternatively, start with CAPM (no experience required) and upgrade to PMP later.

### "The PMP exam seems really hard"
**Reality:** It is challenging—pass rates hover around 60-70%. But with 8-12 weeks of dedicated study and quality practice exams, you can pass. Many military spouses pass on their first attempt by following structured study plans.

### "I can't afford the training and exam fees"
**Solution:** PMI membership ($139) gives you PMBOK free and exam discount. MyCAA covers many training programs. Google PM Certificate is ~$300 and increasingly accepted. Total investment of $500-1,500 is recoverable within months of higher salary.

### "What if I pass but can't find a remote job?"
**Solution:** Remote PM positions are abundant post-pandemic. The PMP certification is the most requested PM qualification. Apply broadly—most spouses report multiple offers within 2-3 months of certification.

### "I don't have a technical background for tech PM roles"
**Solution:** Many PM roles require PM skills, not technical expertise. Focus on industries you understand (healthcare, finance, operations). Technical PMs exist, but so do business PMs, marketing PMs, and operations PMs.

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Foundation
