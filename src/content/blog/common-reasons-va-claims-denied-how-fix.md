## Bottom Line Up Front

**Most VA claim denials are fixable.** 60-70% of denied claims are appealed successfully with proper evidence. Common denial reasons: insufficient evidence, lack of nexus, missing medical documentation, rating schedule misunderstanding. Each denial reason has specific fix. Understanding why claim denied determines best appeal strategy. This guide explains top 10 denial reasons and specific fixes for each. Most denials overcome with additional evidence (Supplemental Claim strategy).

---

### Denial Reason 4: Rating Criteria Not Met

**Why Claim Denied:**
- Evidence insufficient for claimed rating percentage
- Condition present but doesn't meet rating criteria
- Rating schedule requirements not satisfied
- Functional impairment not sufficient for claimed rating

**How to Fix:**
1. **Review VA rating schedule** for your condition
2. **Document specific functional limitations** required for rating claimed

3. **Obtain evidence** from any providers during gap periods
4. **Get statement from medical provider** explaining why gaps not unusual for condition
5. **Provide current treatment documentation** showing ongoing condition

**Evidence to Add:**
- Any historical medical records from gap period
- Medical provider statement explaining gap is typical for condition
- Current medical documentation showing condition persistence
- Timeline explaining why gaps occurred (poverty, lack of insurance, etc.)

**Appeal Strategy:** Supplemental Claim explaining gaps and providing current evidence

---

### Denial Reason 6: Insufficient Functional Impairment

**Why Claim Denied:**
- Medical condition present but minimal functional impact
- Rating criteria require specific functional limitation not demonstrated
- VA concluded condition doesn't affect daily functioning

**How to Fix:**
1. **Document specific daily functional limitations** in detail
2. **Provide concrete examples** of how condition impairs activities
3. **Gather employment impact documentation** (performance issues, accommodations needed)
4. **Get medical provider statement** specifically addressing functional impairment
5. **File Supplemental Claim** with detailed functional documentation

**Evidence to Add:**
- Personal statement with specific functional limitation examples
- Work-related documentation (medical leave, accommodations, performance decline)
- Family corroboration of functional impact
- Medical provider statement addressing functional limitations

**Appeal Strategy:** Supplemental Claim focusing entirely on functional impairment documentation

---

### Denial Reason 7: Failure to Appear for C&P Exam

**Why Claim Denied:**
- You didn't attend scheduled VA exam
- Claim denied for failing to cooperate
- VA assumes lack of evidence if you don't participate in exam

**How to Fix:**
1. **File new claim** (claim can't be salvaged; must refile)
2. **Attend C&P exam** if new exam scheduled (attendance mandatory)
3. **Request exam reschedule** if you missed due to emergency
4. **Bring all medical records** to exam
5. **Prepare detailed explanation** of conditions for examiner

**Appeal Strategy:** Refile claim; don't miss scheduled exam

---

### Denial Reason 8: Disqualifying Medical Evidence

**Why Claim Denied:**
- Medical records show condition improved/resolved
- Exam showed no current symptoms
- VA concluded condition not service-connected based on evidence

**How to Fix:**
1. **Request new evaluation** if condition has worsened since exam
2. **Provide current evidence** showing condition still present/worsened
3. **Explain why improvement temporary** or temporary remission
4. **Get medical provider statement** addressing why exam results don't represent current status
5. **File Supplemental Claim** with current evidence if condition still present

**Evidence to Add:**
- Current medical evaluation showing condition still present
- Evidence condition worsened since exam
- Medical explanation for why exam results outdated
- Timeline of condition fluctuations

**Appeal Strategy:** Supplemental Claim with current evidence if condition still active

---

### Denial Reason 9: Non-Presumptive Condition (Without Nexus)

**Why Claim Denied:**
- Condition claimed not on VA presumptive list
- Denied because no medical nexus proving service connection
- VA requires proof that non-presumptive condition service-connected

**How to Fix:**
1. **Obtain strong nexus letter** from medical provider
2. **Document service trauma/event** causing condition
3. **Provide detailed timeline** showing condition began with service trauma
4. **Gather medical evidence** supporting nexus
5. **File Supplemental Claim** with nexus letter

**Evidence to Add:**
- Strong nexus letter from medical provider
- Service documentation of trauma/stressor
- Medical records showing symptom onset with trauma
- Detailed personal statement explaining service connection

**Appeal Strategy:** Supplemental Claim with comprehensive nexus letter and supporting evidence

---

### Denial Reason 10: Disagreement on Rating Percentage

**Why Claim Denied (Partially):**
- Condition approved but rated lower than claimed
- Evidence supports some rating but not claimed percentage
- VA disagrees on severity assessment

**How to Fix:**
1. **File claim for rating increase** (condition established; argue for higher percentage)
2. **Document worsening symptoms** since initial rating
3. **Gather evidence** for higher rating percentage
4. **Request new evaluation** showing greater functional impairment
5. **File Supplemental Claim** with evidence supporting higher rating

**Evidence to Add:**
- Updated medical records showing worsening
- Functional impairment documentation supporting higher rating
- Medical provider statement supporting higher rating
- Work-related impact documentation

**Appeal Strategy:** Supplemental Claim or HLR requesting rating increase

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Denied for Insufficient Nexus
**Original Denial:** PTSD claim denied; "No evidence linking claimed PTSD to service trauma"

**What Was Missing:** No nexus letter; only personal statement

**Appeal Fix:** Supplemental Claim with psychiatrist statement: "Service trauma caused PTSD; relationship clear and well-established in medical records"

**Result:** Approved; 40% rating

**Key:** Nexus letter made the difference

### Example 2: Denied for Insufficient Functional Impairment
**Original Denial:** Knee arthritis approved at 10%; "Minimal functional impairment documented"

**What Was Missing:** Minimal functional documentation; only diagnosis

**Appeal Fix:** Supplemental with detailed functional limitations: "Cannot walk more than 30 minutes," "Work accommodations needed," "Medical leave for exacerbations"

**Result:** Increased to 20% rating

**Key:** Specific functional examples changed outcome
