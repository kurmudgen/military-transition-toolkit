# Oklahoma Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Oklahoma operates two VA medical centers—Oklahoma City VAMC serving central and western Oklahoma, and Jack C. Montgomery VAMC in Muskogee serving eastern Oklahoma—plus 17+ outpatient clinics statewide. The Oklahoma City system received a 4-star patient survey rating and 3-star overall rating in 2024 (significant improvement), while Muskogee provides comprehensive care across 25 eastern Oklahoma counties. About 90% of Oklahoma veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care.

For education, the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University both participate in Yellow Ribbon programs (unlimited students), offer strong veteran support services, and have veteran enrollment of 900+ and 1,000+ respectively. Oklahoma's standout benefit is free community college tuition for children of 100% disabled veterans—saving families $13,920-$14,400 over two years.

Employment is strong, with Oklahoma having one of the lowest veteran unemployment rates at **1.0% in 2023** (compared to 3.0% nationally). Tinker Air Force Base is Oklahoma's largest single-site employer with 25,000+ personnel, actively recruiting veterans for civilian positions. Fort Sill provides 5,000+ civilian jobs. Governor Kevin Stitt expanded veteran hiring preference for all state jobs in 2023.

Overall rating: **8/10** for healthcare (two medical centers with good coverage), **9/10** for education (excellent state benefits and strong university programs), **9/10** for employment (veteran unemployment 1.0%, major military installations hiring).

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- 90% of Oklahoma veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care
- Urban access (Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman): Excellent—direct access to medical centers or clinics
- Rural access: Good—17+ clinics cover most areas, though remote counties (Panhandle, far western OK) drive 60-90+ minutes

**Quality Ratings:**
- Oklahoma City VAMC: 4 stars patient satisfaction, 3 stars overall (significant improvement in 2024)
- Muskogee VAMC: 3-4 stars (VA average)
- Both facilities have improved dramatically since 2020 with facility upgrades and staffing increases

**Wait Times:**
- Primary care: 10-20 days (meets VA's 20-day standard)
- Mental health: 15-30 days (good, improving with telehealth expansion)
- Specialty care: 25-45 days (cardiology and orthopedics run longer; typical for VA)

**Areas for improvement:** Remote areas of Oklahoma Panhandle, far northwest, and far southeast have limited clinic access. Veterans in these areas drive 60-90 minutes for care. Community Care referrals help, but rural access remains a challenge.

### Community Care (Non-VA Options)

Oklahoma has strong Community Care networks:

- **Eligibility:** If you live 40+ miles from VA, wait times exceed 28 days, or service isn't available at VA
- **Networks:** OU Health, Saint Francis Health System, Mercy Health (Oklahoma City, Tulsa), Integris Health, Norman Regional Hospital
- **Coverage:** VA authorizes and pays for care at civilian facilities

**TRICARE:** Military retirees have excellent TRICARE network access in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Lawton, and other metro areas. Rural coverage is limited but improving.
