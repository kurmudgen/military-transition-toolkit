# Migraines Secondary to Neck Injury: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Well-established cervical-headache connection
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 30-50%
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected neck condition, migraine diagnosis, headache log, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** High (70-80%) with proper documentation

Cervicogenic headaches and migraines commonly develop secondary to neck injuries. If you have a service-connected cervical spine condition and experience chronic headaches, this is a strong secondary claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For migraines secondary to neck injury:
- Your cervical spine condition must be service-connected
- Headaches must be diagnosed
- Medical evidence links headaches to neck condition

## How Neck Injuries Cause Headaches

### Cervicogenic Headaches

**Definition:** Headaches originating from cervical spine structures.

**Mechanism:**
- Cervical spine pathology irritates nerves
- Upper cervical nerves (C1-C3) share pathways with trigeminal nerve
- "Trigeminocervical convergence" causes head pain
- Muscle tension from neck problems radiates to head

### Types of Headaches from Neck Conditions

**Cervicogenic Headaches:**
- Originate from cervical structures
- Usually one-sided
- Often with neck stiffness
- Precipitated by neck movement

**Migraines Triggered by Neck:**
- Neck pain triggers migraine cascade
- True migraines with cervical trigger
- Throbbing, often with aura/nausea

**Tension-Type Headaches:**
- From cervical muscle tension
- Band-like pressure
- Often bilateral

### Common Neck Conditions Leading to Headaches

- Cervical degenerative disc disease
- Cervical strain/sprain
- Herniated cervical disc
- Cervical radiculopathy
- Whiplash injury
- Cervical arthritis
- Cervical stenosis

## VA Rating Criteria for Headaches

Headaches are rated under DC 8100 (Migraine):

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 0% | Less frequent attacks |
| 10% | Characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months |
| 30% | Characteristic prostrating attacks averaging once monthly |
| 50% | Very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability |

### Key Terms

**Prostrating:** Attack that forces you to stop what you're doing and lie down.

**Severe Economic Inadaptability:** Headaches significantly interfere with ability to work.

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Neck Condition:**
- Service connection documentation
- Current rating
- Imaging (MRI, X-ray)
- Treatment records

**For Headaches:**
- Formal headache diagnosis
- Neurology evaluation preferred
- Headache diary/log
- Treatment records
- Medication history

### The Headache Log (Critical)

**Track Every Headache:**
- Date and time
- Duration
- Severity (1-10 scale)
- Whether prostrating
- Associated symptoms (nausea, sensitivity)
- Trigger if known (often neck movement)
- Impact on activities
- Medications taken

**This is one of the most important pieces of evidence.**

### The Nexus Letter

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Neurologist preferred
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Headache diagnosis**
4. **Connection to cervical condition**
5. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including cervical spine imaging and headache evaluations. [Veteran] is service-connected for cervical degenerative disc disease at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] meets diagnostic criteria for chronic migraines, experiencing [frequency] prostrating attacks per month.*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] migraines are at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected cervical spine condition.*

*Medical Rationale: The pathophysiologic connection between cervical spine pathology and headaches is well-established. The upper cervical spine nerves (C1-C3) converge with the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the brainstem, a phenomenon known as trigeminocervical convergence. This allows cervical nociceptive input to be perceived as head pain.*

*[Veteran's] cervical imaging shows [specific findings] that can generate nociceptive signals. The temporal relationship between neck injury and headache onset, the pattern of headaches precipitated by neck movement, and the clinical features support cervicogenic mechanism. [Veteran's] headaches meet ICHD-3 criteria for cervicogenic headache with associated migraine features."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Start Headache Log

Begin documenting immediately:
- Every headache for at least 3-6 months
- Detail each episode thoroughly
- Note prostrating attacks especially

### Step 2: Get Headaches Evaluated

See neurologist if possible:
- Formal diagnosis
- Classification of headache type
- Treatment recommendations

### Step 3: Establish Cervical Connection

Document:
- Headaches often triggered by neck movement
- Headaches accompanied by neck pain
- Timeline correlating with neck condition

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get specialist opinion:
- Neurologist or headache specialist preferred
- Must explain cervical-headache mechanism
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Include headache log
- Upload all evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Headache examination expected
- Bring headache log
- Describe typical attacks
- Explain prostrating nature and frequency

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No headache log** - Essential evidence; start now

2. **Not specifying "prostrating"** - Use this term in documentation

3. **Missing frequency** - Document EVERY headache, not just severe ones

4. **No neurology evaluation** - Strengthens claim significantly

5. **Not linking to neck** - Must explain cervical trigger

6. **Forgetting aura symptoms** - Document sensitivity, nausea, visual changes

7. **Underreporting** - Document all attacks, not just worst ones

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Cervicogenic Migraines

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, 20% cervical DDD
- Daily headaches, 8-10 severe per month
- Often prostrating
- Neck stiffness precedes headaches

**Evidence:**
- 6-month headache log showing 8-10 prostrating/month
- Neurology diagnosis
- Nexus explaining convergence mechanism

**Outcome:** 30% for migraines
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 44% (rounds to 40%)

### Case Study 2: Chronic Daily Headaches

**Background:** 52-year-old veteran, 30% cervical strain
- 15-20 headache days per month
- Multiple prostrating attacks weekly
- Unable to work during severe attacks

**Evidence:**
- Detailed headache log
- Neurologist evaluation
- Employment records showing missed work
- Strong nexus

**Outcome:** 50% for migraines (severe economic inadaptability)
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 65% (rounds to 70%)

### Case Study 3: Initially Denied

**Background:** 45-year-old veteran, 10% cervical strain
- Chronic headaches
- No headache log
- Denied for lack of evidence

**On Supplemental Claim:**
- Added 6-month headache log
- Neurology evaluation
- Detailed nexus letter

**Outcome:** 30% approved on supplemental claim

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Migraines at 30%:**
- Before: 20% neck = $327.99
- Add 30% migraines = 44% → rounds to 40%
- After: $673.28
- Increase: $345.29/month

**Migraines at 50%:**
- Before: 30% = $508.05
- Add 50% migraines = 65% → rounds to 70%
- After: $1,716.28
- Increase: $1,208.23/month

## Types of Headache Diagnoses

### Cervicogenic Headache

**Criteria:**
- Pain originates from cervical structures
- Usually unilateral
- Precipitated by neck movement
- Reduced cervical ROM

### Migraine with Cervical Trigger

**Criteria:**
- Meets migraine criteria (ICHD-3)
- Cervical component identified
- May have aura

### Chronic Daily Headache

**Definition:** 15+ headache days per month
**Types:** Transformed migraine, chronic tension-type

## TDIU Considerations

### When Headaches Support TDIU

If migraines rated 50% with "severe economic inadaptability":
- This language supports TDIU claim
- Document inability to maintain employment
- Combine with other service-connected conditions

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No nexus to neck condition"** - Need stronger cervical connection
2. **"Attacks not prostrating"** - Use proper terminology
3. **"Insufficient frequency"** - Headache log critical

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add headache log if missing
- Neurology evaluation
- Stronger nexus from specialist
- Buddy statements about attacks
