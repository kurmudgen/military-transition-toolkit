## Bottom Line Up Front

Coast Guard Maritime Enforcement Specialists are **highly trained law enforcement professionals** with boarding operations, maritime security, force protection, and tactical skills that translate directly to federal law enforcement, police, border patrol, and security careers. Your Law Enforcement Training Center (LETC) certification, weapons proficiency, maritime law enforcement experience, and tactical operations background make you a top-tier candidate. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$75,000** for police and corrections, with federal agents (CBP, Border Patrol, USMS, DEA) earning **$60,000-$85,000+** and experienced federal agents hitting **$95,000-$135,000+**. Every federal law enforcement agency actively recruits military veterans. You're walking into veteran preference and high demand.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every Coast Guard ME wonders: "How does my maritime law enforcement experience translate to civilian police work?"

Here's the truth: **You're already a certified law enforcement officer with specialized training most cops don't have.**

What you did in the Coast Guard:
- Completed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Training Center (LETC) certification
- Conducted maritime law enforcement boarding operations
- Enforced federal laws (drug interdiction, fisheries, immigration, safety)
- Used force continuum and defensive tactics
- Qualified with firearms (pistol, rifle, shotgun)
- Performed vessel searches and seizures
- Detained and processed suspects
- Testified in federal court
- Worked with FBI, DEA, CBP, ICE on multi-agency operations

That's **more law enforcement training and operational experience** than most entry-level police recruits have.

The difference? You need state-specific **Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)** certification for state/local police, but your Coast Guard law enforcement credentials give you massive advantage in federal law enforcement where veteran preference applies.
