## Bottom Line Up Front

Wisconsin offers some of the most generous tax benefits for veterans in the nation. If you're 100% service-connected disabled, you can eliminate your entire property tax bill through a refundable credit. All military retirement pay is fully exempt from state income tax with no age restrictions or dollar limits. Disabled veterans get free vehicle registration, and combat pay is fully exempt. Over 20 years, these benefits can save a 100% disabled veteran with a $300,000 home more than $120,000 in property taxes alone, plus an additional $100,000+ in income tax savings on military retirement pay.

## Property Tax Credit for Disabled Veterans

The Veterans and Surviving Spouses Property Tax Credit is Wisconsin's most valuable tax benefit. Unlike many states that offer small fixed credits, Wisconsin refunds 100% of your property taxes paid on your primary residence.

### Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the full property tax credit, you must meet these specific criteria:

- **Disability Rating**: 100% service-connected disability from the VA, OR rated individually unemployable due to service-connected disabilities
- **Residency**: Entered active duty as a Wisconsin resident OR lived in Wisconsin for at least five consecutive years after entering active duty
- **Discharge Status**: Honorable discharge from U.S. armed forces
- **Property**: Own and occupy your primary dwelling in Wisconsin

### What the Credit Covers

The credit equals 100% of property taxes paid on your primary residence, including up to one acre of land. There is no dollar cap on the credit amount.

**Real-World Examples**:

- **Milwaukee Home ($235,000 value)**: Average property tax of $4,260 annually = $4,260 annual credit
- **Madison Home ($400,000 value)**: Average property tax of $9,200 annually = $9,200 annual credit
- **Green Bay Home ($280,000 value)**: Average property tax of $6,730 annually = $6,730 annual credit
- **Rural Wisconsin Home ($200,000 value)**: Average property tax of $3,520 annually = $3,520 annual credit

### 20-Year Savings Projections

Assuming 3% annual property tax increases:

- **$200,000 home**: $94,638 total savings over 20 years
- **$235,000 home** (Milwaukee average): $114,543 total savings over 20 years
- **$280,000 home** (Green Bay average): $180,896 total savings over 20 years
- **$400,000 home** (Madison average): $247,311 total savings over 20 years

### How to Claim the Credit

1. **Initial Application**: Contact Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) first to obtain eligibility verification
   - Phone: 1-800-WIS-VETS (1-800-947-8387)
   - Online: https://dva.wi.gov
   - Email: WDVABenefits@dva.wisconsin.gov

2. **Documentation Required**:

   - VA disability rating letter showing 100% service-connected or individual unemployability
   - Proof of Wisconsin residency (driver's license, utility bills)

3. **Annual Filing**: Claim the credit on your Wisconsin state income tax return (Form 1) using Schedule H. The credit is refundable, meaning you'll receive the full amount even if you owe no income tax.

4. **Timeline**: File with your regular tax return by April 15. If you don't owe income tax, you can file Schedule H alone by the same deadline.

### County-Specific Variations

While the state credit covers 100% of property taxes, some counties and municipalities offer additional benefits:

**Milwaukee County**:

- The veteran died as a result of service-connected disabilities
- The veteran was receiving or entitled to receive the credit at the time of death
- The surviving spouse occupies the same primary residence

## Military Retirement Income Tax Exemption

Wisconsin is one of only 14 states that completely exempts military retirement pay from state income tax. This benefit has no age requirements, no dollar limits, and no phase-outs.

### What's Included

- Regular military retirement pay
- Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments
- Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan

### How to Claim the Exemption

1. **On Your Tax Return**: Subtract qualified military retirement payments on Schedule SB, line 12 of your Wisconsin Form 1
2. **Documentation**: Keep your 1099-R showing military retirement income
3. **No Special Application**: Unlike the property tax credit, you don't need pre-approval from WDVA

### Comparison to Neighboring States

Wisconsin's full exemption is significantly better than neighboring states:

- **Illinois**: Partial exemption only for income under certain thresholds
- **Minnesota**: Partial deduction based on age and income
- **Iowa**: Partial exemption with maximum limits
- **Michigan**: Full exemption (similar to Wisconsin)

## Combat Pay and Active Duty Tax Benefits

Wisconsin follows federal tax treatment for military pay, meaning federally exempt military income is also exempt from Wisconsin state tax.

### Combat Zone Pay Exclusion

If your military pay qualifies for the federal combat zone tax exclusion under IRS rules, it's automatically exempt from Wisconsin state income tax as well.

**Enlisted Personnel**: All combat zone pay is federally and state tax-exempt, with no dollar limit.

**Officers**: Combat zone pay is exempt up to the highest enlisted pay rate plus imminent danger/hostile fire pay.

**2025 Examples**:
- E-4 serving in combat zone: $36,000 annual pay = $0 Wisconsin tax
- E-6 serving in combat zone: $48,000 annual pay = $0 Wisconsin tax
- O-3 serving in combat zone: Approximately $60,000-$75,000 exempt (varies by time in grade)

### Reserve and National Guard Active Duty Benefits

Wisconsin offers special exemptions for Reserve and National Guard members called to active federal service:

**Eligible Service**:
- Called to active federal service under 10 USC 12302(a) (partial mobilization)
- Called to active federal service under 10 USC 12304 (presidential reserve call-up)
- Called to active federal service under 10 USC 12304b (preplanned missions)
- Called to special state service authorized by Department of Defense under 32 USC 502(f)

**What's Exempt**: All military pay received during these qualifying call-ups is exempt from Wisconsin income tax.

**How to Claim**: Use Schedule SB of Form 1 to subtract the exempt pay.

### Active Duty Stationed Outside Wisconsin

If you're on active duty and stationed outside Wisconsin under military orders:
- Your military pay is subject to Wisconsin income tax if you're a Wisconsin resident
- However, you can defer filing and payment until you return to Wisconsin or separate from service
- No penalties or interest accrue during the deferral period

## Vehicle Registration Fee Waivers for Disabled Veterans

Wisconsin offers vehicle registration benefits, though they're more limited than some other states.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Do I qualify for the property tax credit if I'm rated individually unemployable but not 100% P&T?

Yes. Individual unemployability (IU) ratings qualify for the full property tax credit, even if your combined rating is less than 100%. You need a VA letter stating you're unemployable due to service-connected disabilities.

### 2. Can I claim the property tax credit if I have a mortgage?

Yes. The credit applies whether you have a mortgage or own your home outright. The credit is based on property taxes paid, not homeownership status.

### 3. What happens if I move to a different home in Wisconsin?

You can continue claiming the credit on your new primary residence. Update your information with WDVA when you move.

### 4. Does the property tax credit apply to condos and townhomes?

Yes. Any primary residence where you pay property taxes qualifies, including condos, townhomes, and mobile homes on owned land.

### 5. Can I claim both the property tax credit and the homestead credit?

No. You must choose one or the other. For 100% disabled veterans, the property tax credit is almost always more valuable.

### 6. Is military retirement pay from other countries exempt?

No. Only retirement from U.S. military services is exempt. Foreign military pensions are taxable.

### 7. Do I have to be retired from the military to get the income tax exemption?

Yes. The exemption applies to military retirement pay, not disability compensation. VA disability payments are federally tax-exempt and therefore also exempt from Wisconsin tax.

### 8. Can I claim the income tax exemption if I worked a civilian job after military retirement?

Yes. The exemption applies to your military retirement pay regardless of other income sources. Report your civilian income normally and subtract military retirement on Schedule SB.

### 9. What if I move to Wisconsin after already retiring from the military?

You can claim the military retirement income exemption as soon as you become a Wisconsin resident. The exemption applies to all military retirement income, regardless of where you lived when you retired.

### 10. Do Reserve and Guard retirement payments qualify for the income tax exemption?

Yes, if you receive retirement pay from the Reserve or Guard retirement system (typically at age 60), it's fully exempt from Wisconsin income tax.

### 11. Are VA disability payments taxable in Wisconsin?

No. VA disability compensation is federally tax-exempt and therefore not subject to Wisconsin income tax. This includes both service-connected compensation and pension payments.

### 12. Can I claim the property tax credit if I'm 70% disabled instead of 100%?

No. The property tax credit requires a 100% service-connected disability rating OR individual unemployability status. Lower ratings don't qualify.

### 13. What if I'm 90% disabled and working toward 100%?

File for the credit as soon as your rating reaches 100% or you receive individual unemployability status. The credit applies starting the year you qualify. You cannot claim it retroactively for previous years when you were rated lower.

### 14. How do I prove my combat pay is exempt?

Your military W-2 (or 1099-MISC for contractors) will show combat pay separately. If it's federally exempt, it's automatically Wisconsin exempt. Report it the same way on your state return as your federal return.

### 15. Do disabled veteran license plates cost anything?

The plates themselves are free, but you still pay standard vehicle registration fees. The value comes from parking privileges, not registration savings.

### 16. Can my spouse use disabled veteran parking privileges when I'm not in the car?

No. Parking privileges are limited to use by the disabled veteran or qualified operators acting under the veteran's express direction. Your spouse can only use the privileges when transporting you.

### 17. What documentation do I need to claim the property tax credit?

Initially: DD-214, VA rating letter, proof of residency, and property tax statement. After the first year, you'll only need to verify that your circumstances haven't changed.

### 18. When should I apply for the property tax credit?

As soon as you receive your 100% rating or IU status. Contact WDVA immediately at 1-800-947-8387 to start the verification process. You can claim the credit for the year you qualify.

### 19. Are federal income tax refunds taxable in Wisconsin?

No. Federal tax refunds aren't taxable income in Wisconsin. This is standard tax treatment, not a veteran-specific benefit.

### 20. Can I claim the military retirement exemption and still contribute to a Wisconsin 529 plan and get the state deduction?

Yes. The military retirement exemption and 529 contribution deduction are separate. You can claim both. Wisconsin allows up to $3,560 per beneficiary in 529 deductions annually (2025 limit).

## Final Thoughts

Wisconsin's veteran tax benefits are among the most generous in the nation. The combination of 100% property tax credit for disabled veterans and full military retirement income exemption can save tens of thousands of dollars annually and hundreds of thousands over a lifetime.

The key is knowing what you're entitled to and actually claiming it. Too many veterans leave money on the table because they don't know these benefits exist or think they're too complicated to claim. They're not. Contact WDVA at 1-800-947-8387, and they'll walk you through every step.

These benefits are your earned compensation for service and sacrifice. Don't leave them unclaimed. File that paperwork, claim every credit and exemption, and put those savings to work for your family's future.

Welcome home, and welcome to Wisconsin.
