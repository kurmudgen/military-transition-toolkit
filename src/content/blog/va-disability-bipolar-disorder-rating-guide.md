# VA Disability Rating for Bipolar Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Bipolar Disorder is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9432** with ratings from **0% to 100%** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. Due to the cyclical nature of bipolar (alternating manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes), many veterans receive **50-70%** or higher ratings. The key challenge is proving **service connection**—either showing onset during service, or establishing secondary connection to TBI, military stressors, or medications. Bipolar often causes significant occupational impairment due to its episodic, unpredictable nature. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Bipolar Disorder and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Bipolar Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. It involves episodes of mania (or hypomania) and depression.

**Types:**
- **Bipolar I**: Manic episodes lasting at least 7 days, often with depressive episodes
- **Bipolar II**: Hypomanic episodes (less severe) with depressive episodes
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms for at least 2 years

**Manic symptoms:**
- Abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
- Increased energy and activity
- Decreased need for sleep
- Racing thoughts, rapid speech
- Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
- Distractibility
- Increased risky behavior (spending, sexual, business)
- Psychotic features in severe cases

**Depressive symptoms:**
- Persistent sadness or emptiness
- Loss of interest in activities
- Sleep disturbances
- Fatigue and low energy
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feelings of worthlessness
- Suicidal thoughts

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Onset of symptoms during service
- First manic or depressive episode during military service
- Diagnosis during service

**Secondary/aggravation connections:**
- **TBI**: Brain injury can trigger or worsen bipolar
- **Extreme stress**: Combat, operational stress may trigger episodes
- **Sleep deprivation**: Can trigger manic episodes
- **Medications**: Some military medications (steroids, antimalarials) may trigger mania

**Important:** Bipolar disorder has strong genetic components. If you had symptoms before service, you can argue aggravation—that military service made the condition worse.

## VA Rating Criteria for Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar Disorder is rated under **38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9432** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mental condition diagnosed, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or require continuous medication |
| **10%** | Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms during periods of stress, OR symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **30%** | Occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent inability to perform tasks, due to symptoms like: depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks (weekly or less), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss |
| **50%** | Reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms like: panic attacks more than weekly, memory impairment, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships |
| **70%** | Deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood) due to symptoms like: suicidal ideation, near-continuous depression or panic, impaired impulse control, neglect of hygiene, inability to establish and maintain relationships |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms like: gross impairment in thought processes, persistent delusions or hallucinations, danger of hurting self or others, inability to perform daily living activities |

### Key Points About Bipolar Ratings

**Episodic nature is important:** Bipolar involves cycles. The VA must consider impairment during episodes, not just between episodes.

**Manic episodes often support higher ratings** due to impaired judgment, risky behavior, and inability to maintain employment.

**Hospitalizations support severity** and may warrant 70-100%.

**Medication side effects** also contribute to impairment.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**For direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing:
  - Mood disturbances
  - Manic or depressive episodes
  - Psychiatric evaluation or treatment
  - Behavioral issues consistent with bipolar
- Disciplinary records that may reflect manic behavior
- Performance evaluations showing mood-related changes

**For secondary connection:**
- Service-connected TBI documentation
- Evidence of triggering circumstances during service
- Medical literature connecting military factors to bipolar

**For aggravation:**
- Pre-service records showing baseline
- Service records showing worsening
- Post-service records showing permanent worsening

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **Psychiatric evaluation** confirming bipolar diagnosis
2. **Treatment records** showing:
   - Medication regimen (mood stabilizers, antipsychotics)
   - Hospitalizations
   - Episode documentation
   - Therapy records

### Severity Evidence

- Frequency and duration of episodes
- Hospitalizations
- Suicide attempts or ideation
- Employment history (difficulty maintaining jobs)
- Relationship history
- Functional limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will assess:**
1. Diagnosis confirmation (Bipolar I, II, or other)
2. Episode history (manic, hypomanic, depressive)
3. Current symptoms
4. Treatment history and response
5. Functional impairment

**What to document and report:**
- History of manic and depressive episodes
- Hospitalizations
- Suicide attempts or thoughts
- Employment difficulties
- Relationship impacts
- Current symptoms (even if between episodes)

**Important:** If you're examined during a stable period, describe your symptoms during episodes clearly. The rating should reflect your impairment during episodes, not just your best days.

## Secondary Conditions to Claim

1. **Sleep Disorders** - Bipolar affects sleep
2. **Substance Use Issues** - Often co-occurs (self-medication)
3. **Anxiety Disorders** - Commonly co-occurs
4. **GERD/GI Issues** - Stress and medications affect gut
5. **Weight Changes** - Medications cause weight gain

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied

### 1. "No nexus to service"
**Why it happens:** Bipolar often has pre-service genetic components
**How to avoid:**
- Argue onset during service OR
- Argue aggravation (service made it worse) OR
- Establish secondary connection to TBI or other condition

### 2. "Symptoms present before service"
**How to handle:** Document pre-service baseline and show permanent worsening during/after service

### 3. "Currently stable on medication"
**How to understand:** Stability doesn't preclude rating. Document:
- Medication requirements (supports need for treatment)
- What happens without medication
- Side effects affecting function

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim bipolar if I had symptoms before service?
Yes. If military service permanently worsened your condition beyond its natural progression, you can claim aggravation.

### What if I'm stable on medication?
You can still receive a rating. The need for continuous medication supports at least 10%. Document what happens if you miss medication and any side effects.

### How do manic episodes affect my rating?
Manic episodes often involve impaired judgment, impulsivity, and inability to function normally—all supporting higher ratings. Document specific incidents.

### What if bipolar caused career-ending issues in service?
This strongly supports service connection. Document administrative actions, discharges, or disciplinary issues related to symptoms.
