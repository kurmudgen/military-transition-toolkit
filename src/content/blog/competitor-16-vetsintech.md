## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Complementary:
1. **Serve non-tech veterans** - 70-80% pursuing other careers
2. **Add VetsinTech to MTT** - Integrate VIT programs into MTT career pathways
3. **VA claims + tech training** - File for benefits while learning to code

5. **All locations** - MTT digital-first serves veterans everywhere, not just 27 cities
6. **Financial planning** - Optimize tech salary + VA benefits

### Positioning:
**"VetsinTech for tech careers, MTT for everything else"**

**"All careers + comprehensive support"** vs tech-only

- MTT becomes official comprehensive transition platform for VIT members
- VIT provides tech training pathways within MTT
- Joint offering: Tech career + VA claims + state benefits + financial planning

### Key Insight:
VetsinTech **dominates tech transition** with 100K community, top partnerships, and proven results. MTT **should partner, not compete** - integrate VIT's tech pathways and serve broader transition needs they don't address (VA claims, non-tech careers, financial planning).

**Strategic angle:** Official VetsinTech comprehensive transition partner
