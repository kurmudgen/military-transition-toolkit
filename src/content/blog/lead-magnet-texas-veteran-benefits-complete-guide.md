## INTRODUCTION

### Why I Created This Guide

As a Navy E6 going through my own transition, I've spent hundreds of hours researching veteran benefits across the country. Texas consistently ranks at the very top for veteran-friendly states, offering unique benefits like the Hazlewood Act that exist nowhere else in America.

I created this guide because I was frustrated by how scattered the information was—buried across dozens of state agency websites, county offices, and outdated PDFs. You shouldn't need a research degree to access the benefits you earned through your service.

### The Problem This Solves

Most veterans leave thousands of dollars on the table simply because they don't know what's available or how to apply. Texas offers some of the most generous veteran benefits in the nation, but the application processes vary by county, eligibility requirements can be confusing, and deadlines are strict.

Missing the April 30th property tax exemption deadline alone could cost you thousands. Not knowing about the Hazlewood Act could mean paying $40,000+ for education that should be free. Not utilizing the Veterans Land Board's low-interest home loans could cost you tens of thousands in interest over the life of your mortgage.

This guide consolidates everything into one actionable resource.

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Read Chapter 1 first if you own or plan to own property in Texas**—property tax exemptions are your highest-value benefits
2. **Read Chapter 2 if you or your dependents plan to attend college**—the Hazlewood Act alone is worth $50,000+
3. **Mark pages relevant to your situation** with sticky notes or highlights
4. **Complete the action plan at the end**—it's designed to get you enrolled in benefits within 30 days
5. **Keep this guide as a reference** when life changes (marriage, children, disability rating changes)
6. **Share it with fellow veterans** who could benefit

## CHAPTER 1: Property Tax Exemptions & Benefits

### Overview

Texas's property tax exemptions for veterans are among the most generous in the nation. Depending on your disability rating and circumstances, you could reduce your property tax by thousands annually or eliminate it entirely.

### The Five Main Property Tax Benefits

1. **$5,000 - $12,000 Exemption** (10%+ service-connected disability)
2. **Additional $12,000 for Age 65+** (disabled veterans)
3. **Total Exemption** (100% P&T service-connected disability)
4. **Surviving Spouse Benefits** (carryover exemptions)
5. **Deployed Service Member Exemption**

Let's break down each benefit in detail.

### 💰 DISABILITY RATING-BASED EXEMPTIONS (Texas Tax Code Section 11.22)

#### Who Qualifies

- Honorably discharged veterans

#### What You Get (Exemption Amount by Disability Rating)

*Based on varying county tax rates (typically 2.5%-6%)

#### Example Calculation (50% Disabled Veteran)

- Annual savings at 3% tax rate: **$300**
- Combined with homestead exemption: **$500-$700+ annual savings**

💡 **Pro Tip:** These exemptions apply to your residence homestead property. You must occupy the property as your primary residence to qualify.

---

#### Who Qualifies

- Honorably discharged veteran
- 100% service-connected disability rating from VA **OR**

**Over 20 years of homeownership, this benefit could save you $120,000-$200,000+.**

#### Special Provisions for 100% Disabled Veterans

**Donated Residence:**
A charity may donate a residence homestead to a disabled veteran at no cost to the veteran, and the residence homestead is exempt from taxation if the charity's donation is stated in a recorded deed and the veteran hasn't previously received a donated residence homestead in Texas.

**Age of Home:**
The property is exempt whether you live in a brand new home or one built 100 years ago.

---

### 👴 ADDITIONAL $12,000 EXEMPTION FOR VETERANS AGE 65+

#### Who Qualifies

- Age 65 or older
- Service-connected disability of at least 10%
- Residence homestead property

#### What You Get

An **additional $12,000** exemption on top of your disability-rating exemption.

#### Example Stacking Benefits

**Scenario:** 70-year-old veteran with 50% disability rating

- Base exemption (50% disability): $10,000
- Age 65+ disabled veteran: $12,000
- **Total exemption: $22,000**
- Standard homestead: $100,000
- **Grand total: $122,000 in exemptions**

On a $350,000 home, this reduces your taxable value to $228,000, saving approximately **$750-$1,500 annually** depending on your county's tax rate.

---

### 💍 SURVIVING SPOUSE BENEFITS (Texas Tax Code Section 11.22)

#### Who Qualifies

Surviving spouses of veterans who:
- Received a property tax exemption for disabled veterans at time of death
- Have not remarried
- Continue to reside in the property

#### What You Get

**Full continuation** of the veteran's property tax exemption, including:
- Same exemption amount the veteran was receiving
- 100% exemption if veteran was 100% disabled
- Continues indefinitely if spouse doesn't remarry

#### Transferability Provision

If the surviving spouse sells the property, they can transfer the same dollar amount of exemption to a new residence homestead in Texas (if they continue to not remarry).

- Veteran passes away
- Surviving spouse continues to receive **full exemption**
- Spouse sells home and buys new $500,000 home
- **Full exemption transfers to new home**

⚠️ **Important:** Remarriage terminates the exemption permanently.

---

### 🎖️ PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR DONATED HOMESTEAD

If a charitable organization donates a residence homestead to a partially disabled veteran at no cost, the veteran qualifies for a **partial exemption** from taxation equal to a percentage of appraised value based on disability rating:

- 10-29% disability = 10% of appraised value exempt
- 30-49% disability = 30% of appraised value exempt
- 50-69% disability = 50% of appraised value exempt
- 70%+ disability = 100% of appraised value exempt

---

### 🪖 DEPLOYED SERVICE MEMBER EXEMPTION (Texas Tax Code Section 11.131)

#### Who Qualifies

- Texas service members deployed outside the U.S.
- Service in active duty in any branch of Armed Forces

💡 **Pro Tip:** You must apply for this exemption each year you're deployed. It's not automatic.

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL DEADLINE: APRIL 30th

**You MUST apply by April 30 to receive veteran exemptions for that tax year.**

#### Late Applications

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 HAZLEWOOD LEGACY PROGRAM

One of the most valuable aspects of the Hazlewood Act is the ability to transfer unused benefits to your children.

#### How Transfer Works

Eligible Texas veterans may assign or transfer **unused hours** of Hazlewood exemption to their children, subject to these conditions:

**Eligible Children:**
- Biological children
- Stepchildren
- Adopted children
- Claimed as dependents on your federal tax return

**Requirements for Children:**
✓ **Age:** Must be 25 years old or younger on the first day of semester/term
✓ **Residency:** Must be Texas resident (defined as living in Texas for 12 months)
✓ **Veteran Status:** Parent must be eligible for Hazlewood Act
✓ **Not withdrawn:** Cannot have been convicted of felony
✓ **Good standing:** Must maintain good academic standing

#### Transfer Limitations

- Veterans can transfer up to 150 hours **total** (not per child)
- Once hours are used by a child, they cannot be reclaimed
- Multiple children can share the benefit, but total cannot exceed 150 hours

**Example Scenario:**
- Veteran has 150 unused hours
- Child #1 uses 60 hours (Associates degree)
- Child #2 uses 90 hours (remaining balance for Bachelor's)
- Veteran has 0 hours remaining

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you plan to use some hours yourself AND transfer some to children, use yours first. You can always transfer unused hours later, but once transferred, you can't take them back.

---

### 🎖️ HAZLEWOOD EXEMPTION FOR CHILDREN OF DECEASED/DISABLED VETERANS

#### Separate Program for Children

Children of certain veterans qualify for Hazlewood benefits **independent of any transfer:**

**Qualifying Scenarios:**
1. Veteran parent **killed in action**
2. Veteran parent **died from service-connected causes**
3. Veteran parent **100% disabled** from service-connected causes
4. Veteran parent **died from any cause** after being 100% service-connected disabled

**Children's Eligibility:**
- Parent was Texas resident at time of death or disability determination
- Child under age 26 on first day of semester
- Child meets academic and residency requirements

**Benefits:**
- Up to 150 credit hours tuition exemption
- Independent of parent's Hazlewood usage
- Can attend any Texas public institution

---

### 👰 HAZLEWOOD FOR SPOUSES

#### Who Qualifies

Spouses of veterans qualify for Hazlewood if the veteran:
- Qualifies for Hazlewood Act themselves
- Is 100% service-connected disabled and unable to use the benefit due to disability

#### Limitations

Spouses receive fewer exemptions than veterans and children:
- Must use benefit while married to veteran
- Benefit terminates upon divorce
- Limited to specific circumstances

💡 **Pro Tip:** If both you and your spouse are veterans, you EACH qualify for up to 150 hours (300 hours combined for your household).

---

### 📚 OTHER TEXAS EDUCATION BENEFITS

#### 1. **Tuition Exemption for Surviving Spouses and Children (Texas Education Code 54.203)**

Provides tuition exemption at Texas public colleges for:
- Surviving spouses of members who died in service
- Surviving spouses who have not remarried
- Children under age 26 of deceased service members

#### 2. **Top 10% Automatic Admission**

Texas law guarantees automatic admission to Texas public universities for students graduating in the top 10% of their Texas high school class (some universities limit percentage to top 6% at certain schools like UT Austin).

**Why This Matters for Veterans' Children:**
Your children automatically qualify for admission to excellent universities if they perform well in Texas high schools.

#### 3. **Concurrent Enrollment Exemption**

High school students who are children of disabled veterans or killed in action receive tuition exemption for college courses taken concurrently during high school.

---

### ⚠️ COMMON HAZLEWOOD ACT MISTAKES

❌ **Mistake #1:** Assuming you can use Hazlewood AND GI Bill simultaneously
✓ **Reality:** Must exhaust federal benefits first or not use them for same semester

❌ **Mistake #2:** Thinking Hazlewood covers private universities
✓ **Reality:** Only Texas PUBLIC institutions qualify

❌ **Mistake #3:** Not tracking hours used
✓ **Reality:** You only get 150 hours total—monitor usage carefully

❌ **Mistake #4:** Waiting too long to transfer to children
✓ **Reality:** Children must be under 26 on first day of semester—transfer early

❌ **Mistake #5:** Assuming Hazlewood covers living expenses
✓ **Reality:** Only tuition and mandatory fees—you still need funding for housing, books, etc.

---

## CHAPTER 4: Employment Preference & Career Services

### Overview

Texas law provides significant employment preferences for veterans in state government hiring, plus numerous career support services to help you transition successfully to civilian employment.

### 🎖️ VETERANS' EMPLOYMENT PREFERENCE (Texas Government Code Chapter 657)

#### What It Means

Texas law **mandates** employment preference for veterans in **all state agency hiring**, giving you a significant competitive advantage when applying for state jobs.

#### Who Qualifies for Preference

**Category 1 - Veterans:**
✓ Honorable discharge from U.S. Armed Forces
✓ Served on active duty (not training only)

**Category 2 - Veteran with Disability:**
✓ Veteran with service-connected disability
✓ Receives VA compensation

**Category 3 - Family Members:**
✓ Surviving spouse who hasn't remarried
✓ Orphan of veteran killed on active duty
✓ Spouse of active duty service member
✓ Spouse of veteran with 70%+ disability (if spouse is primary income source)

---

### 📊 HOW VETERANS' PREFERENCE WORKS IN TEXAS

#### 1. **State Agency Hiring Goal: 20%**

Every Texas state agency must establish a goal to hire **veterans for at least 20%** of total positions.

This creates strong incentive to hire veterans.

#### 2. **Mandatory Interview Requirements**

**If 6 or fewer applicants interviewed:**
- At least **1 must be a veteran** (if qualified veteran applied)

**If 7+ applicants interviewed:**
- At least **20% must be veterans** (if qualified veterans applied)

**Example:**
- Agency interviews 10 candidates
- Minimum 2 must be qualified veterans

#### 3. **Competitive Exam Points**

**Standard Veteran:** +10 points added to exam score
**Disabled Veteran:** +15 points added to exam score

**Example:**
- Exam score: 85/100
- Disabled veteran: 100/100 (85 + 15)
- Moves you to top of candidate pool

#### 4. **Direct Hire Authority**

State agencies may:
- Designate positions as **"veteran-only"** positions
- **Directly hire** veterans without advertising position
- Fast-track veteran applicants through hiring process

#### 5. **Retention Preference**

During layoffs/reductions in force:
- Veterans receive preference in retention decisions
