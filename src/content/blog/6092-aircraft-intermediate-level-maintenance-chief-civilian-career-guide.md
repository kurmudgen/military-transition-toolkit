## Let's address the elephant in the room

When 6092s research civilian careers, they sometimes hear: "Intermediate maintenance doesn't exist in civilian aviation." "Your experience is too military-specific." "Civilians don't understand I-level."

**That's completely wrong.** Here's the reality:

Civilians call it "component repair," "depot maintenance," "heavy maintenance," or "MRO operations"—but it's the SAME work you've been leading for years.

You didn't just "manage a shop." You:
- Led intermediate maintenance departments of 50-150+ Marines across multiple specialized shops
- Managed complex component repairs and overhauls (engines, transmissions, dynamic components, avionics, hydraulics)
- Coordinated between O-level (line maintenance) and depot-level facilities
- Made technical decisions on component repair vs. replacement vs. depot induction
- Ensured quality assurance and regulatory compliance on life-limited components
- Managed component exchange programs and rotable assets worth $20-50M+
- Troubleshot complex aircraft systems requiring depot-level diagnostics
- Interfaced with engineering, supply, depot facilities, and OEM representatives
- Developed technical procedures and led mishap investigations
- Mentored senior SNCOs and developed technical leaders

That's **MRO operations management, technical services leadership, quality assurance, depot-level repair management, and program leadership**—skills that translate directly to senior positions at MRO facilities, airlines, aerospace manufacturers, and defense contractors.
