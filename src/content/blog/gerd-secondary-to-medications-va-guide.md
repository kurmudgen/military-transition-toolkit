# GERD Secondary to Medications: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Medications are recognized cause
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-30%
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected condition, medication history, GERD diagnosis, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate (55-70%) with proper documentation

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) commonly develops as a side effect of medications used to treat service-connected conditions. NSAIDs for pain, certain psychiatric medications, and other drugs can damage the esophageal sphincter or increase acid production.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition can result from treatment for a service-connected condition, including medication side effects.

For GERD secondary to medications:
- You must have a service-connected condition
- Medications prescribed for that condition cause or worsen GERD
- Medical evidence must establish the medication connection

## Medications That Cause GERD

### NSAIDs and Pain Medications

**Common Culprits:**
- Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
- Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)
- Aspirin
- Meloxicam
- Diclofenac

**Mechanism:**
- Irritate esophageal lining
- Reduce protective mucus
- Impair lower esophageal sphincter
- Direct mucosal damage

### Psychiatric Medications

**Antidepressants:**
- Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline)
- SSRIs can affect GI motility
- Some cause nausea/reflux

**Benzodiazepines:**
- Relax lower esophageal sphincter
- Increase reflux

**Antipsychotics:**
- Affect GI motility
- Weight gain worsens GERD

### Other Medications

**Muscle Relaxants:**
- Cyclobenzaprine
- Relax esophageal sphincter

**Calcium Channel Blockers:**
- For hypertension
- Relax sphincter

**Bisphosphonates:**
- For osteoporosis
- Direct esophageal irritation

**Opioids:**
- Slow gastric emptying
- Increase reflux risk

## VA Rating Criteria for GERD

GERD is rated under 38 CFR § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (Hiatal Hernia):

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Two or more symptoms: heartburn, epigastric pain, regurgitation, dysphagia, arm or shoulder pain, of less severity |
| 30% | Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health |
| 60% | Symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health |

**Most GERD cases rate 10-30%**

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition
- Service connection documentation
- Medication history with dates
- Prescriptions showing NSAIDs, psychiatric meds, etc.
- Duration on each medication

#### For Your Secondary Condition (GERD)
- Formal GERD diagnosis
- EGD (upper endoscopy) if performed
- Treatment records
- PPI/medication history for GERD
- Documentation of symptoms

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Gastroenterologist or physician
2. **Record review statement**
3. **GERD diagnosis**
4. **Medication review** - Specific medications and their GI effects
5. **Causal statement** - "At least as likely as not" language
6. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including medication history and gastroenterology records. [Veteran] is service-connected for [lumbar degenerative disc disease] at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] has been diagnosed with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, confirmed by [EGD findings/clinical diagnosis].*

*Medication History Review:*
*- Meloxicam 15mg daily for back pain: [start date] to present ([X] years)*
*- Ibuprofen 800mg TID PRN: [dates used]*
*- [Other medications]*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] GERD is at least as likely as not caused by long-term NSAID use for service-connected [condition].*

*Medical Rationale: NSAIDs are well-documented to cause gastrointestinal complications including GERD. The mechanism involves: (1) reduction of protective prostaglandins in the GI mucosa, (2) direct irritation of the esophageal and gastric lining, and (3) impairment of lower esophageal sphincter function.*

*[Veteran's] records show GERD symptoms developed approximately [X] months after initiating chronic NSAID therapy, consistent with medication-induced GERD. The temporal relationship and chronic NSAID use establish probable causation.*

*FDA labeling for [medications] lists GI complications including reflux as known adverse effects."*

### Medication Timeline

Create detailed timeline:
- Each medication prescribed for service-connected condition
- Start dates
- Duration of use
- Known GI side effects of each
- When GERD symptoms began

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Causative Medications
- Review all medications for service-connected conditions
- Identify those with GI side effects
- Document duration of use

### Step 2: Get GERD Diagnosed
- See gastroenterologist
- Consider EGD for documentation
- Get formal diagnosis
- Begin treatment

### Step 3: Document Medication Connection
- Create medication timeline
- Include package insert warnings
- Correlate with symptom onset

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter
- Find gastroenterologist or physician
- Provide complete medication history
- Request letter linking medications to GERD
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Claim
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Link to service-connected condition through medications
- Upload all evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam
- Examiner reviews GERD severity
- Documents symptoms
- May ask about medication history

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No medication documentation** - Complete pharmacy records essential

2. **Missing the timeline** - When did GERD start relative to medications?

3. **Not including FDA warnings** - Package inserts support causation

4. **Weak nexus** - Must explain how specific medications cause GERD

5. **Forgetting weight gain** - If medications caused weight gain, this also contributes to GERD

6. **No ongoing treatment** - Document PPI use, dietary changes

7. **Not claiming hiatal hernia** - If present, same diagnostic code

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: NSAIDs for Back Pain

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, 40% lumbar DDD
- On meloxicam daily for 8 years
- Developed GERD, now on omeprazole

**Evidence:**
- Complete medication timeline
- GERD diagnosis with EGD showing esophagitis
- Nexus from gastroenterologist
- FDA warnings for meloxicam

**Outcome:** 10% for GERD
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 50%

### Case Study 2: Multiple Medications

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran
- 50% PTSD (on antidepressants)
- 20% knee (on NSAIDs)
- GERD from multiple medication effects

**Evidence:**
- Nexus addressing both medication pathways
- Complete pharmacy history
- EGD documentation

**Outcome:** 30% for GERD (considerable impairment documented)
**Combined Rating:** 60% → 70%

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Example 1: Single Condition + GERD**
- Back: 40%
- GERD: 10%
- Combined: 46% → Rounds to 50%
- Monthly increase: $175.42

**Example 2: Multiple Conditions + GERD**
- PTSD: 50%
- Back: 20%
- GERD: 30%
- Combined: 50% → 60% → 72% → 70%
- Monthly: $1,716.28

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"GERD common condition"** - Need individualized causation
2. **"No nexus to medications"** - Need stronger medication connection
3. **"Symptoms not severe enough"** - Document all symptoms

### Strengthening Your Claim

1. **Gastroenterology evaluation** - Specialist opinion
2. **EGD results** - Objective evidence
3. **Complete medication timeline** - Every relevant medication
4. **FDA package insert information** - Supports causation

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which medications are most likely to cause GERD?**
A: NSAIDs (ibuprofen, meloxicam, naproxen) are most commonly implicated. Benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants also frequently cause GERD.

**Q: Do I need an EGD?**
A: Not required, but provides objective evidence of esophageal damage.

**Q: What if I stopped taking the medication?**
A: GERD can persist after medication cessation. Document current symptoms.

**Q: Can I claim GERD secondary to PTSD directly?**
A: Stress can worsen GERD. Both direct and medication pathways can be argued.

**Q: What's the difference between 10% and 30% GERD?**
A: 30% requires "considerable impairment of health" with multiple severe symptoms.

**Q: Is hiatal hernia the same as GERD?**
A: Related but distinct. Both rated under DC 7346. Hiatal hernia can cause GERD.
