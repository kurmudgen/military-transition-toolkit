# Military Retirement + VA Disability: Can You Get Both? (CRDP vs CRSC Explained 2025)

If you're a military retiree with a VA disability rating, you need to understand this: for decades, the government forced retirees to choose between their full retirement pay or their VA disability compensation. You couldn't get both.

That changed with CRDP (Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay) and CRSC (Combat-Related Special Compensation). Most retirees can now receive both, but you need to understand which program you qualify for and how to apply.

Here's the problem: most retirees don't even know these programs exist. The military doesn't automatically enroll you. If you don't apply, you don't get paid. We're talking about thousands of dollars per year left on the table.

Let me break down exactly how this works, who qualifies, and how to get every dollar you're entitled to.

## The Old System: The VA Offset (Still Affects Some Retirees)

First, you need to understand the default system that screws retirees over.

### How the VA Offset Works

When you retire from the military, you receive:
- **Military retirement pay** (based on years of service and rank)

When you have a service-connected disability, the VA awards:
- **VA disability compensation** (based on disability rating percentage)

Sounds like you should get both, right? Wrong.

By default, the VA **deducts your VA disability amount from your military retirement pay**. This is called the "VA offset" or "waiver."

**Example:**
- Military retirement pay: $2,500/month
- VA disability compensation (50% rating): $1,000/month
- What you actually receive:
  - Retirement pay: $1,500/month ($2,500 - $1,000 offset)
  - VA disability: $1,000/month
  - **Total: $2,500/month**

You're not getting both. You're getting your retirement pay OR your VA disability - whichever is higher. The VA payment just replaces part of your retirement.

**Why does this exist?**
Congress decided retirement pay and disability compensation serve different purposes. You shouldn't get paid twice for the same service. Makes sense in theory, but it sucks in practice.

**The good news:** CRDP and CRSC eliminate this offset for most retirees. You CAN get both.

## CRDP: Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay

CRDP is the program that allows most retirees to receive both full retirement pay AND full VA disability compensation.

### Who Qualifies for CRDP?

You qualify if you meet ALL of these:
1. **You're a military retiree** (20+ years of service, not medically retired)
2. **You have a VA disability rating of 50% or higher**
3. **Your disability is service-connected** (doesn't have to be combat-related)

That's it. If you served 20+ years, retired normally, and have a 50%+ VA rating, you qualify.

### What CRDP Pays

CRDP eliminates the VA offset, allowing you to receive:
- **Full military retirement pay** (no reduction)
- **Full VA disability compensation** (no offset)

**Example with CRDP:**
- Military retirement pay: $2,500/month (full amount)
- VA disability compensation (50% rating): $1,000/month (full amount)
- **Total: $3,500/month**

That's an extra $1,000/month compared to the offset system. $12,000 per year. Every year. For life.

### CRDP Phase-In Schedule (Pre-2014 Retirees)

If you retired before January 1, 2014, your CRDP was phased in gradually over 10 years:
- 2004-2013: Gradual increases from 0% to 100%
- **2014 and beyond: 100% CRDP for all qualifying retirees**

If you retired after January 1, 2014, you get immediate 100% CRDP as soon as you qualify.

### Important CRDP Details

**You must have a 50% or higher VA rating:**
- 40% rating: No CRDP (still subject to offset)
- 50% rating or higher: Full CRDP

**It's automatic (mostly):**
- DFAS (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) automatically enrolls you once VA notifies them of your 50%+ rating
- But errors happen - verify you're receiving full amounts

**You can switch between CRDP and CRSC:**
- If you qualify for both, you can choose whichever pays more
- You cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC simultaneously

## CRSC: Combat-Related Special Compensation

CRSC is a separate program for retirees whose disabilities are specifically combat-related. It's more restrictive than CRDP, but can pay more in certain situations.

### Who Qualifies for CRSC?

You qualify if you meet ALL of these:
1. **You're a military retiree** (can be 20-year retirement OR medical retirement)
2. **You have a VA disability rating** (any rating, even below 50%)
3. **Your disability is combat-related**
4. **You waive VA disability pay to receive CRSC** (you don't lose money, but there's a technical waiver)

The key difference: **CRSC requires combat-related disabilities**. CRDP does not.

### What Counts as "Combat-Related"?

This is where it gets tricky. Combat-related includes:

**Direct combat:**
- Injuries from firefights, IEDs, mortar attacks
- Training for combat operations
- Simulated war exercises

**Hazardous duty:**
- Airborne operations injuries
- Flight deck injuries
- Diving injuries
- Parachute injuries

**Instrumentality of war:**
- Injuries caused by military equipment or weapons
- Vehicle accidents during military operations
- Exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange, etc. (if documented)

**Not combat-related:**
- Injuries from PT outside of combat training
- Vehicle accidents during personal time
- Non-combat-related illnesses (sleep apnea, back pain from desk work)

### What CRSC Pays

CRSC payment equals your VA disability rating percentage applied only to combat-related disabilities.

**Example 1: All disabilities are combat-related**
- VA rating: 70% (all combat-related)
- VA disability compensation: $1,800/month
- CRSC payment: $1,800/month
- Military retirement pay: $2,500/month (full amount)
- **Total: $4,300/month**

**Example 2: Some disabilities are combat-related**
- VA rating: 70% total
  - 50% rating from combat injuries
  - 20% rating from non-combat conditions
- VA disability compensation: $1,800/month (full amount)
- CRSC payment: $1,200/month (only the 50% combat portion)
- Military retirement pay: $2,500/month (full amount)
- **Total: $3,700/month**

### CRSC Application Process

Unlike CRDP (which is mostly automatic), CRSC requires a formal application:

1. **Obtain DD Form 2860** (CRSC application)
2. **Gather documentation:**
   - VA rating decision letter
   - Medical records showing combat-related injuries
   - Deployment records (DD214, deployment orders)
   - Combat action awards (CAB, CIB, Purple Heart helps but isn't required)
3. **Submit to your branch's retirement office:**
   - Army: Army Review Boards Agency
   - Navy/Marines: Secretary of the Navy Council of Review Boards
   - Air Force: Air Force Review Boards Agency
   - Coast Guard: Coast Guard Pay and Personnel Center
4. **Wait 6-12 months for review** (yes, it's slow)

**Pro tip:** A Purple Heart, Combat Action Badge, or Combat Infantryman Badge makes approval much easier but isn't required.

### Important CRSC Details

**Medical retirees can qualify:**
Unlike CRDP (which requires 20-year retirement), CRSC is available to medical retirees with combat-related disabilities.

**You must apply:**
CRSC is not automatic. If you don't apply, you don't get paid.

**Appeals take forever:**
If your CRSC application is denied, the appeal process can take 18-24 months.

**You technically "waive" VA pay:**
There's a technical waiver of VA compensation to receive CRSC, but you don't actually lose money. Your CRSC payment replaces the VA offset, achieving the same result as CRDP.

## CRDP vs CRSC: Which One Should You Choose?

Most retirees qualify for one or the other, but some qualify for both. Here's how to decide:

### Choose CRDP if:
- You have a 50%+ VA rating (CRDP requires 50%+)
- Your disabilities are NOT all combat-related
- You want automatic enrollment without application hassle

### Choose CRSC if:
- Your VA rating is below 50% but your disabilities are combat-related
- You're a medical retiree (not 20-year retirement)
- Your combat-related disabilities alone equal a higher rating than your total VA rating
- You were medically retired due to combat injuries

### Do the Math

If you qualify for both, calculate which pays more:

**CRDP Payment = Full VA Disability Compensation**
**CRSC Payment = Only the combat-related portion of your VA rating**

**Example:**
- Total VA rating: 60% ($1,400/month)
- Combat-related portion: 40% ($700/month)
- Non-combat portion: 20%

CRDP pays: $1,400/month
CRSC pays: $700/month

**Choose CRDP** - it's $700/month more.

**Exception: Medical Retirees**
If you were medically retired with less than 20 years of service, you might only qualify for CRSC. In that case, CRSC is your only option.

## Real Dollar Impact: Examples

Let's look at real scenarios to understand the financial impact.

### Scenario 1: 20-Year Retiree, 60% VA Rating, CRDP

**Before CRDP (with VA offset):**
- Military retirement: $2,800/month
- VA disability (60%): $1,400/month
- Offset: -$1,400
- Total received: $2,800/month ($33,600/year)

**After CRDP:**
- Military retirement: $2,800/month (full)
- VA disability (60%): $1,400/month (full)
- Total received: $4,200/month ($50,400/year)

**Benefit: $1,400/month = $16,800/year**

Over 20 years of retirement: **$336,000 additional**

### Scenario 2: Medical Retiree, 80% VA Rating, 60% Combat-Related, CRSC

**Before CRSC (with VA offset):**
- Military retirement: $1,800/month
- VA disability (80%): $2,000/month
- Offset: -$1,800
- Total received: $2,000/month ($24,000/year)

**After CRSC (60% combat-related approved):**
- Military retirement: $1,800/month (full)
- VA disability (80%): $2,000/month (full)
- CRSC adjustment: +$1,400 (combat portion)
- Total received: $3,400/month ($40,800/year)

**Benefit: $1,400/month = $16,800/year**

### Scenario 3: 20-Year Retiree, 40% VA Rating

**Rating below 50% - No CRDP eligibility:**
- Military retirement: $2,500/month
- VA disability (40%): $700/month
- Offset: -$700
- Total received: $2,500/month

**If CRSC applies (combat-related):**
- Must apply for CRSC
- If approved, receives additional $700/month
- Total: $3,200/month

**Takeaway:** If you have less than 50% but your disabilities are combat-related, CRSC is your only path to concurrent pay.

## How to Apply and Verify You're Getting Paid

### For CRDP (50%+ VA Rating, 20-Year Retirement)

**Step 1: Verify your VA rating**
- Log in to va.gov
- Check your current disability rating percentage
- If below 50%, consider filing for an increase if warranted

**Step 2: Check your DFAS account**
- Log in to mypay.dfas.mil
- Look at your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)
- Look for line item "CR" or "Concurrent Pay"

**Step 3: If you don't see CRDP:**
- Call DFAS: 1-800-321-1080
- Ask them to verify your CRDP status
- Confirm VA has shared your 50%+ rating with DFAS

**CRDP is automatic, but verify it's actually happening.**

### For CRSC (Combat-Related Disabilities)

**Step 1: Obtain DD Form 2860**
- Download from your service branch's website
- Or request from your branch's retirement pay center

**Step 2: Gather supporting documentation:**
- Copy of all VA rating decisions
- Medical records showing injuries
- Deployment orders and combat deployment documentation
- DD214 showing combat deployments
- Any combat awards (Purple Heart, CAB, CIB, CAR, etc.)
- Buddy statements from fellow service members if needed

**Step 3: Submit application to your branch:**
- **Army:** Army Review Boards Agency, Indianapolis
- **Navy/Marines:** Navy Council of Review Boards, Washington DC
- **Air Force:** Air Force Review Boards Agency, SAF/MRBR
- **Coast Guard:** Coast Guard Pay and Personnel Center

**Step 4: Wait (unfortunately)**
- Processing time: 6-12 months
- Check status periodically with your branch

**Step 5: If approved, verify payments:**
- Check DFAS account for CRSC payments
- Verify amount matches your combat-related rating portion

## Common Mistakes That Cost Money

**Mistake #1: Not applying for CRSC**
CRSC is not automatic. If you qualify but don't apply, you lose thousands per year.

**Mistake #2: Assuming CRDP is happening**
Even though CRDP should be automatic, errors occur. Verify your LES shows concurrent pay.

**Mistake #3: Not filing for VA rating increase**
If you're at 40% VA rating, you're $700/month away from CRDP eligibility. File for an increase if you have worsening conditions.

**Mistake #4: Not appealing a CRSC denial**
If your CRSC application is denied, appeal. Many denials are overturned with better documentation.

**Mistake #5: Not switching from CRSC to CRDP**
If you initially qualified only for CRSC, but later your VA rating increases to 50%+, switch to CRDP if it pays more.

**Mistake #6: Waiting until after retirement to file VA claims**
File your VA claims BEFORE you retire. The sooner you get rated, the sooner CRDP or CRSC kicks in.

## VA Rating Strategies to Maximize Benefits

To qualify for CRDP, you need 50%+ VA rating. Here's how to ensure you're properly rated:

### File Before Separation
- Use the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program
- File 90-180 days before separation
- Faster processing and earlier payments

### Claim Everything Service-Connected
- Back pain
- Knee/joint issues
- Hearing loss (most common)
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears)
- Sleep apnea
- Mental health (PTSD, anxiety, depression)
- Scars
- Any injury or condition caused or worsened by military service

### Get Nexus Letters
If VA denies service connection, get a private medical opinion (nexus letter) linking your condition to service.

### File for Secondary Conditions
If you have a service-connected knee injury that caused back problems, file the back pain as secondary to the knee.

### Don't Leave Money on the Table
File for everything. Let the VA rate it. You can't be rated for conditions you don't claim.

## Tax Considerations

**VA Disability Compensation: Not Taxable**
Your VA disability payments are not subject to federal income tax.

**Military Retirement Pay: Taxable**
Your military retirement pay is subject to federal income tax.

**CRDP and CRSC: Complex**
- CRDP: Your retirement pay remains taxable, but you also receive non-taxable VA disability
- CRSC: The CRSC portion is typically not taxable

**Bottom line:** Receiving CRDP or CRSC increases your non-taxable income.

**State taxes vary:**
Some states don't tax military retirement at all. Others tax retirement pay but not VA disability. Check your state's rules.

## Timeline: When Do Payments Start?

### CRDP Timeline
- VA awards 50%+ rating
- VA notifies DFAS (can take 30-60 days)
- DFAS adjusts your pay (can take 30-60 days)
- **Total: 2-4 months from rating to first concurrent payment**
- **Retroactive pay:** If there was a delay, DFAS pays retroactively

### CRSC Timeline
- Submit application
- Branch reviews (6-12 months)
- If approved, DFAS adjusts pay (30-60 days)
- **Total: 7-14 months from application to first payment**
- **Retroactive pay:** CRSC pays back to application date or retirement date, whichever is later

## Resources and Next Steps

**Check Your Current Status:**
- Log in to mypay.dfas.mil and review your LES
- Log in to va.gov and verify your disability rating

**If you're not receiving concurrent pay:**
- Calculate if you qualify for CRDP (50%+ rating, 20-year retirement)
- If so, call DFAS: 1-800-321-1080
- If not, determine if you qualify for CRSC and apply

**If you need to increase your VA rating:**
- File for an increase at va.gov
- Consider using a VSO (Veterans Service Organization) for help
- Get current medical evidence supporting your claims

**Apply for CRSC:**
- Download DD Form 2860
- Gather combat deployment and medical documentation
- Submit to your branch's review board

## The Bottom Line

If you're a military retiree with VA disability, you should be receiving BOTH retirement pay and disability compensation - not one or the other.

**CRDP:** If you have 50%+ VA rating and 20+ years of service, you automatically qualify. Verify it's happening.

**CRSC:** If your disabilities are combat-related, apply for CRSC even if your rating is below 50%.

**The financial impact is huge:** $12,000-$20,000+ per year for life.

Don't leave this money on the table. Check your status, file your applications, and get every dollar you're entitled to.
