# Balance Problems Secondary to TBI: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Common TBI residual
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-30% (can be higher with severe dizziness)
- **Key evidence needed:** TBI service connection, vestibular evaluation, balance testing, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** High (70%+) with documented vestibular dysfunction

Balance problems and dizziness are among the most common residuals of traumatic brain injury. If you have service-connected TBI and experience balance issues, this is a strong secondary claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For balance problems secondary to TBI:
- Your TBI must already be service-connected
- You must have diagnosed vestibular/balance dysfunction
- Medical evidence must link your balance problems to TBI

## How TBI Causes Balance Problems

### Vestibular System Damage

**Central Vestibular Dysfunction:**
- TBI damages brainstem vestibular processing
- Cerebellum involvement affects coordination
- White matter damage disrupts balance pathways
- Processing of spatial information impaired

**Peripheral Vestibular Damage:**
- Blast injuries damage inner ear directly
- Concussive forces affect vestibular organs
- Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) triggered
- Labyrinthine concussion

### Types of TBI-Related Balance Problems

**Vestibular Disorders:**
- Post-traumatic vertigo
- BPPV (positional vertigo)
- Labyrinthine dysfunction
- Central vestibular disorder

**Balance-Related Symptoms:**
- Dizziness
- Vertigo (spinning sensation)
- Disequilibrium (unsteadiness)
- Spatial disorientation
- Motion sensitivity
- Oscillopsia (visual disturbance with movement)

### Symptom Characteristics

**Common Presentations:**
- Dizziness with head movement
- Difficulty walking in dark
- Feeling "off balance"
- Sensitivity to visual motion
- Difficulty in crowded/busy environments
- Falls or near-falls
- Need to hold walls/furniture

## VA Rating Criteria

### Peripheral Vestibular Disorders (DC 6204)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Occasional dizziness |
| 30% | Dizziness and occasional staggering |

### Meniere's Syndrome (DC 6205)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 30% | Hearing impairment with vertigo less than once monthly, with or without tinnitus |
| 60% | Hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring 1-4 times monthly |
| 100% | Hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring more than once weekly |

### By Analogy (When Appropriate)

Balance problems may also be rated:
- Under TBI residuals (DC 8045)
- Under cerebellar ataxia codes
- By analogy to closest condition

### TBI Rating (DC 8045) - Balance Component

TBI is rated on multiple facets. Balance/vestibular may be captured under:
- **Motor Activity** facet
- **Visual Spatial Orientation** facet
- Highest facet determines overall rating

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**TBI Documentation:**
- Service connection for TBI
- TBI severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- Mechanism of injury
- Initial symptoms

**Vestibular/Balance Documentation:**
- Formal vestibular evaluation
- Balance testing results
- Treatment records
- Fall history

### Vestibular Testing

**Objective Tests:**
- Videonystagmography (VNG)
- Electronystagmography (ENG)
- Rotary chair testing
- Posturography (balance platform)
- VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potentials)

**Clinical Tests:**
- Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for BPPV)
- Romberg test
- Fukuda stepping test
- Head thrust test
- Dynamic visual acuity

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Neurologist, ENT, or audiologist
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Balance/vestibular diagnosis**
4. **Connection to TBI**
5. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records including TBI documentation and vestibular evaluations. [Veteran] is service-connected for traumatic brain injury at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] has been diagnosed with post-traumatic vestibular dysfunction, manifested by chronic dizziness, positional vertigo, and disequilibrium.*

*Vestibular Testing Results:*
*- VNG: Abnormal with [findings]*
*- Posturography: [findings]*
*- Clinical examination: Positive Romberg, abnormal tandem gait*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] vestibular dysfunction is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected traumatic brain injury.*

*Medical Rationale: Traumatic brain injury commonly damages the vestibular system through multiple mechanisms: (1) direct trauma to inner ear structures (labyrinthine concussion), (2) damage to central vestibular pathways in the brainstem and cerebellum, (3) disruption of vestibular-ocular reflex pathways, and (4) white matter damage affecting spatial processing.*

*[Veteran's] symptoms began within [timeframe] of the TBI and have persisted, consistent with post-traumatic vestibular dysfunction. The temporal relationship and mechanism of injury support TBI as the cause."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Document Your Symptoms

Keep log of:
- Dizziness episodes (frequency, duration, severity)
- Triggers (head movement, visual stimuli)
- Falls or near-falls
- Impact on daily activities

### Step 2: Get Vestibular Evaluation

Request referral to:
- ENT (otolaryngology)
- Neurology
- Audiology (vestibular specialization)
- Vestibular therapy

### Step 3: Complete Balance Testing

Have objective tests performed:
- VNG/ENG
- Posturography
- Clinical balance assessment

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get specialist opinion:
- Must link to TBI
- Must cite specific findings
- Cost: $500-$1,500

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Link to TBI
- Upload all evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- May include vestibular examination
- Describe symptoms accurately
- Don't minimize impact

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not getting vestibular evaluation** - Need objective testing

2. **Attributing to just "dizziness"** - Get specific diagnosis

3. **Missing TBI connection** - Must explicitly link to TBI

4. **Not documenting functional impact** - Falls, daily limitations

5. **Forgetting medication side effects** - Some TBI meds cause dizziness; distinguish

6. **Not claiming if already rated for TBI** - Balance may warrant separate rating

- May recur

**Central Vestibular Dysfunction:**
- Not position-specific
- Constant or prolonged symptoms
- Often with other neurological signs
- More severe impairment typically

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No vestibular diagnosis"** - Need formal evaluation
2. **"Not related to TBI"** - Need stronger nexus
3. **"Symptoms part of TBI rating"** - May need to argue separate rating

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add vestibular testing if not done
- Add specialist nexus
- Document functional impact more thoroughly

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I claim if I'm already rated for TBI?**
A: Yes. Vestibular dysfunction can be rated separately or increase your TBI rating.

**Q: Who evaluates vestibular problems?**
A: ENT specialists, neurologists, or audiologists with vestibular training.

**Q: What if my dizziness comes and goes?**
A: Still claim it. Document frequency and severity. Even occasional dizziness may rate 10%.

**Q: Is BPPV related to TBI?**
A: Yes, TBI can dislodge otoconia (inner ear crystals) causing BPPV.

**Q: My balance problems started years after TBI—can I still claim?**
