# Military to Private Security: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Private security offers veterans diverse opportunities with starting salaries of $35,000-$60,000 for domestic positions and $100,000-$200,000+ for overseas security contractors. Your military training, discipline, and security mindset translate directly—many employers specifically seek veterans. The industry spans from entry-level security guard positions to high-level corporate security management and international protective operations. Most veterans can enter the industry within 1-3 months for domestic roles or 1-6 months for overseas contracts.

## Why Veterans Excel in Private Security

Military training provides exactly what security employers need. Your discipline, situational awareness, and ability to respond to threats exceed civilian training programs.

Weapons proficiency and defensive tactics training from military service are directly applicable. Many armed security positions require skills you already possess.

Your understanding of security operations, access control, and threat assessment provides strong foundation for corporate and facility security.

Leadership experience supports advancement to supervisory and management positions. Security companies need managers who can lead security teams.

Experience working in challenging or hostile environments prepares you for overseas contract work. You've operated where others haven't.

Physical fitness and ability to work demanding schedules align with security requirements. 24/7 coverage means shift work you're accustomed to.

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. Starting With Lowest-Paying Companies**
Not all security companies are equal. Research and target better-paying employers from the start.

**2. Not Getting Licensed Quickly**
State licensing takes time. Begin the process before leaving military or immediately after.

**3. Overlooking Corporate Security**
Corporate security pays better than contract security. Target corporate in-house positions.

**4. Chasing Overseas Contracts Too Early**
Overseas contracts often require experience. Build domestic credentials first unless you have SOF background.

**5. Not Investing in Training**
Additional certifications (CPP, PSP) increase value. Invest in professional development.

**6. Accepting Poor Working Conditions**
Some security posts are better than others. Be willing to move for better opportunities.

**7. Missing Management Opportunities**
Your military leadership translates to security management. Don't stay at officer level too long.
