# VA Disability Rating for Adjustment Disorder: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Adjustment Disorder is rated under **Diagnostic Code 9440** with ratings from **0% to 100%** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. Most veterans receive **10-30%**, though severe cases can rate higher. Adjustment disorder develops in response to identifiable stressors—commonly military service stressors, chronic health conditions, or major life changes related to service. The key distinction from PTSD or MDD is that adjustment disorder is tied to a **specific stressor** and typically improves when the stressor is resolved or the person adapts. Claims typically take 4-6 months.

## What Is Adjustment Disorder and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Adjustment Disorder is a stress-related mental health condition where emotional or behavioral symptoms develop in response to an identifiable stressor. The symptoms are significant but don't meet criteria for other specific disorders like PTSD or major depression.

**Types of Adjustment Disorder:**
- With depressed mood
- With anxiety
- With mixed anxiety and depressed mood
- With disturbance of conduct
- With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct
- Unspecified

**Symptoms include:**
- Feeling sad, hopeless, or crying frequently
- Worry, nervousness, or anxiety
- Difficulty sleeping
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Social withdrawal
- Avoiding important activities (work, bills)
- Physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches)
- Reckless or impulsive behavior

**Military stressors causing adjustment disorder:**
- Transition out of military service
- Medical discharge for injuries/conditions
- Combat deployment stress
- Relationship problems during service
- Loss of career due to injury
- Relocation and family separation
- Chronic pain or disability
- Financial stress after separation

**Important distinction:** Adjustment disorder symptoms must begin within 3 months of the stressor and don't meet criteria for another mental disorder. If symptoms persist beyond 6 months after the stressor ends, the diagnosis may be reconsidered.

## VA Rating Criteria for Adjustment Disorder

Adjustment Disorder is rated under **38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9440** using the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders—the same criteria as PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mental condition diagnosed, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or require continuous medication |
| **10%** | Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency during periods of significant stress, OR symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **30%** | Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, due to symptoms like: depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss |
| **50%** | Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms like: panic attacks more than weekly, memory impairment, impaired judgment, difficulty in establishing and maintaining relationships |
| **70%** | Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood), due to symptoms like: suicidal ideation, near-continuous depression or panic affecting function, neglect of hygiene, inability to establish relationships |
| **100%** | Total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms like: gross impairment in thought processes, persistent delusions, danger of hurting self or others, inability to perform daily living activities |

### Key Points About Adjustment Disorder Ratings

**Lower ratings are common** because adjustment disorder is often considered less severe than PTSD or MDD.

**The diagnosis may evolve:** If symptoms persist and worsen, your diagnosis may be changed to MDD or another condition with different rating considerations.

**Service connection is straightforward** if the stressor is clearly military-related.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**Document the stressor:**
- Military service records
- Medical records showing onset after specific event
- Documentation of the triggering circumstance
- Timeline showing symptoms began within 3 months of stressor

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

- Mental health evaluation diagnosing adjustment disorder
- Treatment records
- Medication records

### Severity Evidence

- Description of functional impairment
- Work and social relationship impacts
- Treatment history

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will assess:**
1. The specific stressor causing your adjustment disorder
2. Current symptoms
3. Functional impairment
4. Whether symptoms meet criteria for other disorders

**Be prepared to:**
- Identify the specific stressor
- Describe your symptoms in detail
- Explain how symptoms affect work and relationships

**Important:** If your symptoms are more severe than typical adjustment disorder, the examiner may diagnose a different condition. Be thorough about all symptoms.

## Secondary Conditions to Claim

1. **Chronic Pain Conditions** - Claim adjustment disorder secondary to these
2. **Physical Disabilities** - Adjustment to living with disability
3. **Sleep Disorders** - Stress affects sleep
4. **GERD/IBS** - Stress affects digestive system

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied

### 1. "Stressor not identified"
**How to avoid:** Clearly document the military-related stressor

### 2. "Symptoms don't require treatment"
**How to avoid:** Document any treatment sought, even minimal

### 3. "Condition resolved"
**How to avoid:** Document ongoing symptoms; consider if diagnosis should be changed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between adjustment disorder and PTSD?
PTSD requires exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence and specific symptom criteria. Adjustment disorder is a response to any stressor (not just trauma) and doesn't require all PTSD symptoms.

### Can adjustment disorder become PTSD or depression?
Yes. If symptoms persist, evolve, or worsen, the diagnosis may change. File for increase or new claim if this occurs.

### Is adjustment disorder "less serious" than other conditions?
Not necessarily. While often considered a milder condition, severe adjustment disorder can significantly impair functioning and warrant substantial ratings.
