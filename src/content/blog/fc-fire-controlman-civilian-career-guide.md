## Bottom Line Up Front

Navy Fire Controlmen (FC) come out with **weapons systems expertise, radar and fire control systems knowledge, complex computer systems troubleshooting, and Top Secret security clearances** that make you one of the most sought-after veterans in the defense industry. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$70,000-$90,000** with active clearances, with experienced technicians hitting **$95,000-$130,000+**, and specialized overseas contractor roles reaching **$140,000-$200,000+**. You'll need some certifications (CompTIA Security+, AEGIS-specific training, maybe an associate's degree), but your clearance and hands-on weapons systems experience make you immediately hireable at premium pay rates.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

When you start researching civilian careers as an FC, you might worry: "My skills are too specialized." "Only defense contractors hire FCs." "What if defense spending drops?"

Here's what that misses: **Your weapons systems and radar expertise is irreplaceable and in massive demand.**

As a Navy Fire Controlman, you:
- Maintained and operated weapons direction systems worth $10+ million (AEGIS, SSDS, MK160, MK92)
- Troubleshot radar systems including SPY-1, SPS-67, SPS-73 phased array radars
- Operated and maintained gun systems (MK 45 5"/54, MK 38 25mm, CIWS)
- Worked with missile systems (Tomahawk, Sea Sparrow, Standard Missile, Harpoon)
- Managed computer networks, displays, and fire control computers
- Held Top Secret security clearances and worked with classified systems
- Performed organizational and intermediate-level maintenance on complex electronics
- Executed weapons employment under operational conditions
- Read and interpreted technical manuals, schematics, and system architectures

That's systems-level engineering knowledge, classified systems expertise, mission-critical troubleshooting, and security-cleared technical skills. Defense contractors are actively competing for veterans with your exact background, and they're paying premium salaries.

## Best civilian career paths for Navy FCs

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where FCs consistently land, with real 2024-2025 salary data.

### Defense contractors – weapons systems (highest pay)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Weapons systems technician
- Fire control systems technician
- Combat systems technician
- AEGIS systems technician
- Radar systems technician
- Field service engineer

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level with Secret clearance:** $70,000-$85,000
- **Experienced with Top Secret clearance:** $95,000-$120,000
- **AEGIS-qualified technician:** $105,000-$135,000
- **Senior systems engineer:** $120,000-$150,000

- **CompTIA Security+** (DoD 8570 requirement) - Cost: $392
- **AEGIS-specific training** (provided by contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon)
- **Manufacturer certifications** (employer provides)

**Reality check:**
This is where FCs make the most money. Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and General Dynamics desperately need FCs to support Navy ships, train crews, perform installations, and provide technical assistance.

You'll work on Navy ships (as a rider), at shipyards during installations and upgrades, at training facilities, or at contractor sites developing and testing new systems. The work is nearly identical to what you did on active duty—troubleshooting weapons systems, performing alignments, running tests, and documenting results.

**Your Top Secret clearance is gold.** Companies will pay premium salaries because getting a new employee cleared takes 12-18 months and costs $10,000-$15,000. You already have it.

Overseas positions (Bahrain, Japan, Guam, Diego Garcia, Rota) pay the highest—$140K-$200K—but require extended time away from home (often 6-12 month rotations).

**Best for:** FCs who want to keep working on weapons systems, maximize earning potential, and leverage clearances for premium pay.

**Companies actively hiring FCs:**
- Lockheed Martin (AEGIS prime contractor)
- Raytheon Technologies / RTX (missile systems)

- Navy systems knowledge

**Certifications needed:**
- **Security clearance** (government will sponsor if lapsed)
- **CompTIA Security+** (for IT-related positions)
- **Relevant degree** (associate's or bachelor's preferred but military experience counts)

**Reality check:**
Federal civilian jobs at Navy shipyards, depots, NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and program offices need FCs to support fleet operations, acquisition programs, testing, and training.

Jobs at Naval Surface Warfare Centers (Port Hueneme, Dahlgren, Indian Head, Panama City), shipyards (Norfolk, San Diego, Bremerton, Pearl Harbor), and NAVSEA offices put you directly supporting the same systems you maintained on active duty.

Benefits are outstanding—pension (FERS), TSP with 5% match, federal health insurance, job security, and work-life balance. Pay is lower than defense contractors (typically 20-30% less), but total compensation including benefits and pension is competitive.

Veteran preference gives you 5-10 points in hiring process. The application process on USAJobs.gov is tedious and slow (4-8 months typical), but worth it for long-term stability.

**Best for:** FCs who want federal benefits, pension, job security, and work-life balance over maximum salary.

**Where to look:**
- Naval Surface Warfare Centers (NSWC Dahlgren, Port Hueneme)
- Naval shipyards (Norfolk, San Diego, Bremerton, Pearl Harbor)

Work is more structured and corporate than defense contracting. You'll work 40-50 hour weeks in labs and manufacturing facilities. Pay is good, benefits are strong, and job security is better than pure defense contractors.

**Best for:** FCs who want to use technical skills in commercial aerospace, prefer corporate structure, and want better work-life balance.

**Companies hiring:**
- Boeing
- Airbus
- Northrop Grumman (commercial division)
- L3Harris (commercial aviation)
- Rockwell Collins (now Collins Aerospace)

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be real. There are civilian skills you don't have yet.

**Business communication and customer service:** Military FCs work with sailors. Civilian roles involve customers, contractors, program managers, and non-technical executives. You'll need to explain complex technical issues in simple language and manage client expectations.

**Corporate culture and workplace dynamics:** Defense contractors have corporate structure, HR policies, performance reviews, and workplace politics. Learn to navigate this. It's different from military chain of command.

**Civilian project management tools:** Most contractors use Microsoft Project, JIRA, Confluence, SharePoint, and other business software extensively. Get familiar with these tools.

**Proposal writing and business development:** Many defense contractor jobs involve writing technical proposals, responding to RFPs, and supporting business development. These are new skills you'll learn on the job.

**Broader systems perspective:** Navy FCs are deep experts on specific systems. Civilian engineers often need broader knowledge across multiple systems and platforms. Be willing to expand your technical knowledge beyond your rate.

## Real Navy FC success stories

**Brandon, 29, former FC2 → Combat systems technician at Lockheed Martin**

Brandon did 8 years on Ticonderoga-class cruisers maintaining AEGIS systems. Got out as an E-5 with active TS/SCI clearance. Applied to Lockheed Martin AEGIS program, got hired at $88K supporting SPY-1 radar and combat system upgrades.

### Month 3: Interview and negotiate
- Tailor resume for each job (use exact keywords: AEGIS, SPY-1, MK 99, Top Secret, etc.)
- Practice interview answers focusing on specific troubleshooting examples, systems knowledge, clearance
- Emphasize deployment experience and operational systems work
- Negotiate salary aggressively (defense contractors expect this; don't accept first offer)
- Ask about clearance upgrade sponsorship (Secret to Top Secret can add $20K to salary)
- Consider contract-to-hire positions if full-time offers aren't coming quickly

## Bottom line for Navy FCs

Your Navy Fire Controlman experience is premium, high-demand expertise.

You've maintained and operated some of the most complex weapons systems on the planet, worked with classified technology that takes 12-18 months of clearance processing to access, and troubleshot mission-critical systems under operational conditions. Defense contractors are competing for veterans with your exact background.

Defense contracting (weapons systems, radar, combat systems), federal civilian service, and aerospace are proven paths. Thousands of FCs have successfully transitioned before you—and they're making great money.

First-year income of $70K-$90K is realistic with active clearance. With Top Secret and AEGIS experience, $95K-$120K is common immediately. Within 3-5 years, $115K-$145K is standard for senior technicians and engineers. Overseas positions pay $140K-$200K.

Your Top Secret clearance is worth $20K-$40K in salary premium. Don't let it lapse. Accept a cleared position within 2 years of separation.

The defense industry has talent shortages for cleared weapons systems technicians. Your FC experience, clearance, and AEGIS/radar/fire control knowledge make you a top-tier candidate that companies will compete for.

Don't settle for low offers. You're worth $80K-$100K minimum with active clearance and FC experience. Know your value.
