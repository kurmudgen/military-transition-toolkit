## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1:** Delaying certifications. CCNA is non-negotiable for network engineering roles. Start immediately.

**Mistake #2:** Ignoring RF specialty. RF engineers earn 15-25% more than general network engineers. If you have RF background, specialize.

**Mistake #3:** Not pursuing higher education. While CCNA sufficient for entry, bachelor's degree required for architect/manager roles. Start pursuing it early (GI Bill available).

**Mistake #4:** Limiting search to IT departments. Telecom carriers, equipment vendors, and tech companies pay significantly more than enterprise IT.

**Mistake #5:** Not negotiating salary. Network engineer market is competitive. Your military background justifies higher offers. Negotiate.
