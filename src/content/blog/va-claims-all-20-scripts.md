## CLAIMS PROCESS FUNDAMENTALS

### How to File Your First VA Disability Claim (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Gather evidence (before you file)**
- Service treatment records (STRs)
- Current medical records/diagnosis
- Buddy statements from service
- Lay statements (your own account)

**Step 2: File your claim**
- VA.gov (fastest)
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- VSO can help (free)
- Claim within 1 year of separation = backdated to day after separation

**Step 3: C&P exam**
- VA schedules exam with contracted provider
- Be honest, don't minimize symptoms
- Describe worst day, not best day
- Bring supporting documents

**Step 4: Decision**
- VA rates 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%
- Decision letter explains rating
- Effective date determines back pay

**Step 5: If denied or low-rated**
- Request Higher-Level Review
- Supplemental Claim with new evidence
- Board of Veterans' Appeals

**Timeline:** 3-6 months average (varies widely)

### PTSD VA Claim: Evidence Required for Approval

**Three elements required:**
1. Current PTSD diagnosis (from psychiatrist/psychologist)
2. In-service stressor event
3. Nexus (medical opinion linking current PTSD to service event)

**Evidence to gather:**
- Mental health treatment records
- PTSD diagnosis from qualified provider
- Stressor statement (your written account of traumatic event)
- Service records showing you were in location where event occurred
- Buddy statements corroborating event
- Personal statement describing current symptoms

**Common stressors that qualify:**
- Combat (including IED, firefight, mortar attacks, etc.)
- Military sexual trauma (MST) - relaxed evidence standard
- Personal assault
- Serious accidents/injuries
- Witnessing death/serious injury
- Fear of hostile military or terrorist activity

**Rating percentages:**
- 0%: Diagnosis but symptoms controlled by medication
- 10%: Mild, transient symptoms
- 30%: Occasional decrease in work efficiency
- 50%: Considerable difficulty in social/work situations
- 70%: Significant impairment in most areas
- 100%: Total occupational and social impairment

**Key:** Don't minimize symptoms. Describe how PTSD affects daily life, work, relationships.

---

### Tinnitus VA Claim Strategy (Most Common Claim)

**Why tinnitus is easy to claim:**
- Very common (especially combat arms, artillery, aviation)
- Hard to prove or disprove
- Rated at 10% ($171.23/month in 2025)
- Often leads to secondary mental health claims

**Evidence needed:**
- Current diagnosis (audiologist can diagnose during C&P exam)
- Service connection (noise exposure in service)
- Nexus (tinnitus caused by military noise exposure)

**Service connection strategies:**
- Document noise exposure in service (weapons, aircraft, machinery, IEDs)
- MOS-specific: Infantry, artillery, aviation, tankers = presumed noise exposure
- Any deployment = likely noise exposure
- Reference specific loud events if possible

**C&P exam:**
- Will perform hearing test
- Will ask about tinnitus symptoms
- Describe: constant ringing/buzzing, affects sleep, affects concentration
- Rate severity honestly

**Rating:** Only 10% possible for tinnitus (no higher rating exists)

**Secondary conditions:**
- Tinnitus → Sleep disturbance → Insomnia claim
- Tinnitus → Difficulty concentrating → Anxiety claim
- Stack claims to increase total rating

---

### Sleep Apnea Secondary to PTSD: How to Connect

**Why this matters:**
- Sleep apnea alone: Can be rated 0%, 30%, 50%, or 100%
- Sleep apnea secondary to PTSD: Easier to prove service connection
- 50% sleep apnea rating = $1,075.16/month (2025)

**The connection:**
- PTSD causes hypervigilance, nightmares, anxiety
- These disrupt sleep, cause sleep disorders
- PTSD often causes weight gain (sedentary, medication side effects)
- Weight gain contributes to sleep apnea

**Evidence needed:**
1. Current PTSD rating (service-connected)
2. Sleep apnea diagnosis (sleep study showing AHI score)
3. Nexus letter from doctor stating "sleep apnea is at least as likely as not caused or aggravated by service-connected PTSD"

**Steps:**
1. Get sleep study if you snore, wake tired, stop breathing during sleep
2. Get CPAP prescription if diagnosed
3. Ask doctor for nexus letter linking to PTSD
4. File secondary claim to PTSD

**Rating criteria:**
- 0%: Asymptomatic but requires CPAP
- 30%: Persistent day-time hypersomnolence
- 50%: Requires use of breathing assistance device (CPAP)
- 100%: Chronic respiratory failure with CO2 retention, cor pulmonale, requires tracheostomy

**Most common:** 50% for CPAP use

---

### Back/Knee/Shoulder Claims: Service Connection Proof

**These are top claimed musculoskeletal conditions**

**Back Pain Claims:**

**Evidence needed:**
- Current diagnosis (degenerative disc disease, lumbar strain, radiculopathy, etc.)
- Service treatment records showing back injury or complaints
- OR buddy statement that injury occurred but wasn't documented
- Nexus linking current condition to service

**Service connection strategies:**
- Heavy lifting, rucking, jumping (Airborne), vehicle accidents
- Cumulative trauma over time
- Specific injury event

**Rating factors:**
- Range of motion (measured during C&P)
- Pain with movement
- Flare-ups frequency
- Incapacitating episodes
- Radiculopathy (nerve damage) = higher ratings

**Ratings:** 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 100% based on severity

**Knee Pain Claims:**

Similar approach: document injury/use, current diagnosis, nexus

Common causes: Running, rucking, jumping, kneeling, vehicle ops

**Shoulder Claims:**

Similar approach: overhead work, lifting, carrying equipment, specific injuries

**Pro tip:** File bilateral claims if both knees/shoulders affected = higher combined rating

---

### Mental Health Claims: Depression and Anxiety

**Depression and Anxiety are separate from PTSD**

Can claim both, but VA usually rates under single mental health rating (whichever is higher)

**Evidence needed:**
- Current diagnosis (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, etc.)
- In-service stressor or cause
- Treatment records
- Nexus

**Service connection strategies:**
- Direct: In-service mental health treatment
- Secondary: Depression/anxiety caused by service-connected physical condition (chronic pain → depression is common)
- Aggravated: Pre-existing condition made worse by service

**Rating percentages:** (Same scale as PTSD)
- 0% to 100% based on occupational and social impairment

**Key symptoms to document:**
- Difficulty with work/relationships
- Social isolation
- Panic attacks frequency
- Suicidal ideation (be honest)
- Sleep disturbance
- Difficulty concentrating
- Medication side effects

---

### Migraines Secondary to TBI or Tinnitus

**Migraines are common secondary condition**

**Primary connections:**
- Secondary to TBI (traumatic brain injury)
- Secondary to tinnitus
- Secondary to neck/cervical spine issues
- Secondary to PTSD/stress

**Evidence needed:**
- Current migraine diagnosis
- Frequency and severity documentation
- Primary service-connected condition
- Nexus letter linking migraines to primary condition

**Rating criteria:**
- 0%: Less frequent than prostrating attacks every 2 months over last several months
- 10%: Prostrating attacks average 1 per 2 months over last several months
- 30%: Prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over last several months
- 50%: Prostrating attacks occur on average once per week or less but more than once per month

**"Prostrating" means:** Severe enough to require bed rest in dark, quiet room

**Documentation tips:**
- Keep migraine diary/log
- Note frequency, duration, severity
- Document work missed, activities avoided
- Get buddy statements from spouse/family observing migraines

---

### Hypertension Secondary to PTSD (Proven Connection)

**Medical research shows PTSD causes hypertension**

**The connection:**
- PTSD causes chronic stress, hypervigilance
- Chronic stress elevates blood pressure
- PTSD medications can cause hypertension
- Well-established in medical literature

**Evidence needed:**
- Service-connected PTSD rating
- Hypertension diagnosis (high blood pressure readings)
- Nexus letter from doctor

**Nexus letter should state:**
"Patient's hypertension is at least as likely as not caused or aggravated by service-connected PTSD due to chronic stress response and hypervigilance."

**Rating criteria:**
- 10%: DBP 100+ or SBP 160+ (diastolic 100 or systolic 160)
- 20%: DBP 110+ or SBP 200+
- 40%: Requires continuous medication
- 60%: Requires multiple medications or specific complications

**Most veterans get:** 0% (diagnosed but controlled) or 10%

**Strategy:** Even 10% hypertension + other conditions helps reach higher combined rating

---

### Presumptive Conditions: Gulf War, Agent Orange, Burn Pits

**Presumptive = automatic service connection (no nexus needed)**

**Gulf War Presumptives (Southwest Asia, 1990-present):**
- Chronic fatigue syndrome
- Fibromyalgia
- Functional gastrointestinal disorders (IBS, etc.)
- Undiagnosed illnesses with qualifying symptoms
- Certain infectious diseases
- Plus: Burn pit exposure conditions (see below)

**Agent Orange Presumptives (Vietnam Era, Thailand, Korea DMZ):**
- Type 2 diabetes
- Ischemic heart disease
- Prostate cancer
- Respiratory cancers
- Multiple myeloma
- Hodgkin's disease
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
- Parkinson's disease
- Plus 14 more conditions

**Burn Pit / Toxic Exposure (PACT Act 2022):**
Expanded presumptive for post-9/11 veterans exposed to burn pits:
- Asthma (diagnosed within 10 years of exposure)
- Various cancers
- Chronic bronchitis
- COPD
- Chronic sinusitis
- Constrictive bronchiolitis
- Emphysema
- Granulomatous disease
- Interstitial lung disease
- Pleuritis
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Sarcoidosis

**How to claim:**
- Simply prove you served in qualifying location during qualifying dates
- Provide current diagnosis
- No nexus letter needed (automatic presumption)

**PACT Act = game changer** for Iraq/Afghanistan veterans

## ADVANCED STRATEGIES

### VA Nexus Letters Explained: Who Writes Them and Why

**Nexus letter = medical opinion linking current condition to military service**

**What it must contain:**
1. Doctor's credentials
2. Review of your service and medical records
3. Current diagnosis
4. Medical opinion: "More likely than not" (>50% probability) or "At least as likely as not" (≥50%) current condition caused by military service
5. Medical reasoning supporting opinion

**Who can write nexus letters:**
- Private doctors (MD, DO)
- Specialists in relevant field (psychiatrist for mental health, orthopedist for joint issues)
- IME (Independent Medical Examination) doctors

**NOT accepted:**
- Chiropractors (for primary nexus)
- Nurse practitioners (limited)
- Your own opinion (lay statement different from nexus)

**Cost:**
- Private doctors: $0-$500 (some won't charge, others specialty fee)
- IME doctors: $1,500-$3,000
- Nexus letter services: $2,000-$3,500

**Do you always need one?**
- No, if service connection is obvious (injury documented in STRs)
- Yes, if service connection is not obvious or for secondary conditions
- Yes, if initially denied and need stronger evidence

**Red flags VA looks for:**
- Form letters (not personalized)
- Doctor didn't review records
- Speculative language instead of medical opinion
- Doctor not qualified in specialty area

---

### C&P Exam Preparation: What to Expect and How to Prepare

**C&P Exam = Compensation & Pension Exam**

**What it is:**
- Medical examination by VA contractor (VES, LHI, QTC)
- Evaluates your claimed conditions
- Determines severity/rating
- NOT treatment (examiner is not your doctor)

**Before the exam:**
- Review your claims so you know what's being evaluated
- Bring all supporting documents (treatment records, buddy statements)
- Prepare to describe worst symptoms, not best day
- List all medications
- Note frequency of flare-ups

**During the exam:**
- Be honest (don't exaggerate but don't minimize)
- Describe impact on daily life, work, relationships
- If pain during range of motion testing, say so
- If symptoms fluctuate, explain frequency of bad days
- Stay calm and respectful (examiner is just doing their job)

**What they evaluate:**
- Range of motion (for joints)
- Severity of symptoms
- Frequency of issues
- Impact on functioning
- Response to treatment

**Common mistakes:**
1. **Minimizing symptoms** ("I'm fine" or "Not too bad") - Don't do this!
2. **Missing the exam** - Automatic denial if you no-show
3. **Being defensive/angry** - Comes across poorly in report
4. **Not explaining secondary effects** - Mention all impacts

**After the exam:**
- Examiner writes report (you don't see it immediately)
- Report goes to VA rater who makes decision
- If you disagree with exam, you can request another or submit rebuttal evidence

**DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire):**
- Standardized forms examiners use
- You can have private doctor complete DBQ instead of C&P exam
- Submit private DBQ as supporting evidence

---

### How to Appeal a VA Denial (HLR, Supplemental, BVA)

**If your claim is denied or rated too low, you have options**

**Option 1: Higher-Level Review (HLR)**

**What it is:** Different VA reviewer looks at same evidence
**Timeline:** Target 125 days
**When to use:** If you think VA made error interpreting existing evidence
**Advantage:** Fastest appeal option
**Disadvantage:** No new evidence allowed

**How to file:** VA Form 20-0996 or VA.gov

---

**Option 2: Supplemental Claim**

**What it is:** Resubmit claim with new and relevant evidence
**Timeline:** Varies (treated as new claim)
**When to use:** When you have new evidence (new nexus letter, new medical records, new diagnosis)
**Advantage:** Can submit new evidence, effective date goes back to original claim if approved
**Disadvantage:** Starts process over

**How to file:** VA Form 20-0995 or VA.gov

**New and relevant evidence examples:**
- Nexus letter from doctor
- New diagnosis
- Additional medical records
- Buddy statements
- Service records you didn't submit before

---

**Option 3: Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA)**

**What it is:** Veterans Law Judge reviews your case
**Timeline:** Long (currently 3-5 years depending on docket)
**When to use:** When other options exhausted or complex legal issue
**Docket lanes:**
- Direct Review: No hearing, no new evidence (fastest - 1 year target)
- Evidence Submission: Can submit new evidence (longer wait)
- Hearing: Request hearing with judge (longest wait)

**How to file:** VA Form 10182

**Consider:** Getting accredited attorney or VSO representative for Board appeals

---

**Which appeal to choose:**
- **HLR:** If VA clearly misread evidence and you just need different eyes
- **Supplemental:** If you have new evidence (most common choice)
- **Board:** If disagreement on legal interpretation or after HLR/Supplemental failed

**Pro tip:** You can pursue multiple lanes simultaneously (HLR for some claims, Supplemental for others)

---

### Secondary Conditions Strategy: Stack Your Claims

**Secondary conditions = conditions caused by already service-connected conditions**

**Why this matters:**
- Gets you additional compensation
- Easier to prove service connection (only need to show connection to primary, not to service directly)
- Stacking multiple secondaries can significantly increase combined rating

**Common secondary condition combinations:**

**1. PTSD → Multiple secondaries**
- Sleep apnea (PTSD → sleep issues → sleep apnea)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease/GERD (PTSD → stress → digestive issues)
- Erectile dysfunction (PTSD → anxiety → ED)
- Hypertension (PTSD → chronic stress → high blood pressure)
- Depression/anxiety (often rated together with PTSD but worth claiming)
- Migraine headaches (PTSD → tension/stress → migraines)

**2. Back injury → secondaries**
- Hip pain (compensating for back = hip strain)
- Knee pain (altered gait = knee damage)
- Radiculopathy (nerve damage from spine)
- Depression (chronic pain → depression)

**3. Knee injury → secondaries**
- Hip pain (altered gait)
- Lower back pain (compensating for knee)
- Opposite knee (overuse compensating)

**4. Tinnitus → secondaries**
- Sleep disturbance (can't sleep due to ringing)
- Depression/anxiety (tinnitus frustration)
- Migraines (some connection)

**5. TBI (traumatic brain injury) → secondaries**
- Migraines (very common)
- Vertigo
- Cognitive issues
- Tinnitus
- Mental health conditions

**How to claim secondary:**
- File VA Form 21-526EZ
- Clearly state: "Claiming [condition] secondary to service-connected [primary condition]"
- Provide nexus letter linking secondary to primary
- Medical literature often supports these connections

**Pro tip:** Search medical journals for "[primary condition] and [proposed secondary]" to find studies supporting connection

### VA Rating Mistakes That Cost You Money

**Mistake #1: Not claiming bilateral conditions separately**

If you have same issue in multiple body parts (both knees, both shoulders, both hips), file bilateral claims.

**Why:** Bilateral factor adds 10% to combined rating (can bump you to next 10% bracket)

**Example:**
- Right knee 10% + Left knee 10% = 19% combined
- But with bilateral factor = 21% which rounds to 20%

**Mistake #2: Claiming too vaguely**

**Bad:** "Back pain"
**Good:** "Lumbar degenerative disc disease with radiculopathy" (specific diagnosis)

Specific diagnosis → proper DBQ form → accurate rating

**Mistake #3: Not describing worst day**

VA rates based on frequency and severity of symptoms. If you say "my knee hurts sometimes," they rate low.

**Better:** "My knee is painful 4-5 days per week, gives out without warning, I've fallen 3 times this year, I can't squat or kneel, flare-ups last 3-4 days and require me to miss work."

**Mistake #4: Missing the intent to file (ITF)**

File Intent to File (VA Form 21-0966) ASAP. This locks in your effective date while you gather evidence.

**Example:**
- File ITF: January 1, 2025
- Gather evidence for 6 months
- File actual claim: July 1, 2025
- If approved, back pay goes to January 1 (not July 1)

**Saves thousands in back pay**

**Mistake #5: Not getting service treatment records before filing**

Many veterans assume VA has all records. Often they don't (especially National Guard/Reserve).

**Solution:** Request your complete military medical records before filing (eVetRecs or NPRC)

**Mistake #6: Waiting too long to file**

**Within 1 year of discharge:** Effective date = day after discharge
**After 1 year:** Effective date = date you filed

**Cost of waiting:** Potentially 12 months of back pay

**Mistake #7: Not claiming everything at once**

Every condition you can prove = more money. Don't be conservative.

Claim everything that bothers you and has service connection. VA can always deny, but you can't go back and claim "I forgot about that" without losing back pay.

**Mistake #8: Not getting help**

VSOs (Veterans Service Organizations) offer FREE help:
- DAV (Disabled American Veterans)
- VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars)
- American Legion
- State VA offices

They know the system and can improve your chances significantly.

### How to Increase Your VA Rating from 70% to 100%

**Why 100% matters:**
- Significantly more monthly compensation ($3,737.85/month for veteran alone at 100% vs $1,716.28 at 70% in 2025)
- Cannot be reduced below 100% after 20 years (protected)
- Dependents get DEA (Dependents Educational Assistance - Chapter 35)
- State benefits often much better at 100% (property tax exemptions, etc.)

**Path 1: Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU)**

**What it is:** 100% compensation even if your combined rating is less than 100%

**Eligibility:**
- Combined rating of 70%+ with at least one condition at 40%+
- OR single condition at 60%+
- AND unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities

**"Substantially gainful employment" threshold:** Generally earning above poverty level

**How to apply:** VA Form 21-8940

**This is often easier than reaching 100% scheduler**

---

**Path 2: Increase Individual Ratings**

Review your current ratings and identify:
1. Conditions rated too low
2. Secondary conditions you haven't claimed
3. Conditions that have worsened

**Common underrated conditions:**
- Mental health (many veterans rated 50% who should be 70% or 100%)
- Sleep apnea (make sure using CPAP = should be 50%)
- Back pain (radiculopathy often not considered)

**File for increase:** VA Form 21-526EZ, check "increase" box

**Provide evidence:**
- Recent medical records showing worsening
- New symptoms
- Increased frequency/severity
- Impact on work/daily life

---

**Path 3: File Missing Secondary Claims**

If you're at 70%, adding one 40-50% secondary condition can push you to or near 100%.

**Example:**
- Current: 70% PTSD + 20% back + 10% tinnitus + 10% knee = 80% combined
- Add: 50% sleep apnea secondary to PTSD
- New combined: 90% (and now eligible for TDIU to reach 100%)

---

**VA Math:** Combined ratings use VA Math (not simple addition)
- Use VA combined ratings table
- Each additional disability reduces value of previous
- Online calculators: cccrm.org/calculator

---

**Path 4: Request C&P Review**

If rated years ago and condition has worsened, request re-evaluation.

**Warning:** VA can decrease rating if they find improvement. Only do this if confident condition has worsened or was initially underrated.

---

### Top 10 VA Claim Mistakes Veterans Make

**Summary of critical mistakes:**

1. Not filing within 1 year of separation (lose back pay)
2. Not claiming everything at once (piecemeal = less back pay)
3. Being stoic during C&P exam (minimizing symptoms)
4. Not getting nexus letters when needed
5. Missing C&P exams (automatic denial)
6. Not appealing low ratings or denials
7. Claiming vaguely instead of specific diagnoses
8. Not documenting symptoms in medical records
9. Not using VSO help (free expert assistance)
10. Giving up after initial denial (appeals often succeed)

---

### VA Math: How Combined Ratings Actually Work

**VA uses "whole person" theory:**

You start at 100% healthy. Each disability reduces remaining health.

**NOT simple addition:**
- 50% + 50% ≠ 100%
- 50% + 50% = 75% combined

**How it works:**
1. Start with highest rating: 50%
2. You have 50% health remaining
3. Next rating (50%) applies to remaining: 50% of 50% = 25%
4. Combined: 50% + 25% = 75%

**Official VA formula:**
Combined = [100 - ((100 - rating1) × (100 - rating2) × ... / 100)]

**Rounding:**
- VA rounds to nearest 10%
- X.5 rounds up (75% = 80%, 84% = 80%, 85% = 90%)

**Use VA combined ratings table or online calculator**

**Bilateral factor:**
- If you have same condition bilaterally (both knees, both shoulders), VA adds bilateral factor
- Adds 10% of combined bilateral rating to overall
- Can help you reach next 10% threshold

**Examples:**
- 70% + 30% + 10% = 81% → rounds to 80%
- 70% + 30% + 20% = 86% → rounds to 90%
- 50% + 50% + 30% + 10% = 87% → rounds to 90%

**Magic numbers for combined rating:**
- 95% or higher = 100%
- 85%-94% = 90%
- 75%-84% = 80%
- 65%-74% = 70%

**Strategy:** When close to next 10% threshold, file additional claims to push over

---

### Buddy Statements: How to Get Effective Evidence

**Buddy statement = lay statement from someone who witnessed your injury or symptoms**

**Who can write buddy statements:**
- Fellow service members
- Spouse/family
- Friends who observed symptoms
- Supervisors (if civilian and post-service)

**When buddy statements help:**
- Injury occurred but wasn't documented in medical records
- Condition existed in service but you didn't seek treatment
- Severity of condition (how it affects you)
- Onset timeline

**What makes effective buddy statement:**

**Include:**
- Name, contact info, relationship to you
- Timeframe they observed you (dates, unit)
- Specific incidents or observations
- Frequency of symptoms they witnessed
- Impact on your functioning they observed
- Dates and locations (specific as possible)

**Example - back injury:**

"I served with [veteran name] in [unit] from [dates] in [location]. On [approximate date], we were conducting [mission] when [veteran] injured his back lifting [specific item]. I witnessed him immediately experience pain and difficulty moving. In the months following, I observed him limping, having difficulty with ruck marches, and taking ibuprofen daily. He mentioned his back pain regularly and I saw him struggle with tasks requiring bending or lifting. This continued throughout our deployment."

**Format:**
- Can be handwritten or typed
- Sign and date
- If possible, notarize (not required but adds credibility)
- Include "I certify this statement is true to the best of my knowledge"

**How to submit:**
- Upload to VA.gov with your claim
- Send via mail to VA regional office
- Provide to VSO to include with your claim file

**Multiple statements stronger than one:**
If 3-4 people corroborate same injury/condition, much more credible than single statement.
