## Bottom Line Up Front

Navy Yeomen (YN) are **administrative professionals, office managers, and executive support specialists** who handle correspondence, personnel records, office administration, legal documents, classified materials, and command-level administrative operations. Your training in office management, document preparation, record-keeping, administrative procedures, and confidential information handling translates directly to high-demand civilian administrative, executive assistant, and office management careers. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$40,000-$55,000** for entry-level administrative assistant positions, with experienced executive assistants earning **$60,000-$85,000**, office managers clearing **$70,000-$95,000**, and senior executive assistants or executive secretaries reaching **$85,000-$110,000+** in major metropolitan areas or executive-level support roles. You'll need some certifications (CAP, MOS, or specialized training), but your Navy administrative experience is exactly what civilian companies desperately need.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

When you start looking at civilian administrative and executive assistant jobs, you'll see postings asking for bachelor's degrees, years of experience with specific software platforms, and expertise in corporate systems you've never touched.

Here's what they don't understand: **you've been managing command-level administrative operations in one of the most complex organizational environments in the world.**

As a Yeoman, you didn't just "type documents and file paperwork." You:

- Managed command correspondence, routing, and suspense tracking for senior leadership
- Prepared official documents, reports, evaluations, and awards following strict formatting requirements
- Maintained classified and sensitive information with zero-tolerance security protocols
- Coordinated calendars, schedules, and meetings for commanding officers and senior staff
- Processed personnel records, transfers, promotions, and administrative actions
- Managed travel arrangements, orders, and itineraries for leadership and personnel
- Maintained filing systems, records management, and document retention per regulations
- Operated office equipment and managed office supplies and resources
- Provided customer service to personnel across all ranks and pay grades
- Prepared briefing materials, presentations, and executive communications
- Handled multiple high-priority tasks simultaneously with competing deadlines

That's not entry-level administrative work. That's executive-level support, office management, project coordination, and administrative operations—skills that corporations pay serious money for. You just need to translate it into civilian business language and get a few certifications to check HR's boxes.

## Best civilian career paths for Navy YN

**Reality check:**
Administrative assistant is the most common and accessible transition for Navy Yeomen. Your YN experience translates directly—you've been doing administrative support work at command level, which is more advanced than most civilian admin positions.

Entry-level administrative assistant positions ($38K-$48K) handle reception, phones, filing, correspondence, scheduling, and general office support. These feel basic compared to your YN duties, but they're your foot in the door. Expect to spend 12-18 months here.

Experienced administrative assistant roles ($45K-$58K) support specific departments or managers, handle more complex correspondence, manage projects, and coordinate across departments. With CAP certification and 2-3 years civilian experience, $55K-$70K is realistic.

Senior administrative assistant positions ($52K-$68K) support senior managers or directors, coordinate complex projects, manage sensitive information, and often supervise junior admin staff. These positions value your command-level experience.

Healthcare, education, government, legal, finance, and corporate offices all need administrative assistants. Larger organizations (500+ employees) typically pay better and offer clearer advancement paths than small businesses.

Government administrative positions (federal GS-0318 series or GS-0341 series, GS-5 to GS-9) offer veteran preference hiring, solid benefits, and salaries from $40K to $70K depending on grade and location.

**Best for:** Navy Yeomen who want stable, office-based work with regular hours, prefer supporting operations over leading them, and want clear advancement path toward office management or executive assistant roles.

### Executive Assistant / Executive Secretary

**Civilian job titles:**
- Executive assistant
- Executive secretary
- Senior executive assistant

- **Executive assistant (2-5 years):** $60,000-$78,000
- **Senior executive assistant:** $75,000-$95,000

- Calendar management for executives with complex schedules
- Confidential information handling
- Executive correspondence preparation
- Meeting coordination and logistics
- Travel arrangement and itinerary management
- Project coordination and follow-up
- Gatekeeping and priority management

- **Advanced Excel training** - Critical for executive reporting and data management. Many free and paid options.

**Reality check:**
Executive assistant roles leverage your experience supporting commanding officers, executive officers, and senior enlisted leadership. If you worked directly for CO/XO/CMC, this experience translates perfectly.

Entry-level EA positions ($50K-$62K) support mid-level executives (directors, VPs). You're managing their calendar, correspondence, travel, and administrative needs. Significant step up from general administrative assistant in responsibility and pay.

Experienced EA roles ($60K-$78K) support senior executives (senior VPs, C-suite). You're their right hand—managing complex schedules, coordinating across departments and organizations, handling sensitive matters, and serving as proxy for executive in some situations.

Senior EA positions ($75K-$95K) support CEOs, presidents, or board members. You're managing high-stakes schedules, confidential strategic information, board meetings, executive travel, and often supervising junior administrative staff.

C-suite EA positions at Fortune 500 companies or major organizations ($85K-$120K+) are elite roles requiring 7-10+ years experience, advanced degrees often preferred, and exceptional skills. These roles offer excellent compensation, exposure to executive decision-making, and advancement opportunities to chief of staff or operations management.

Technology companies, finance, healthcare, legal, consulting, and corporate headquarters all need executive assistants. Major metropolitan areas (NYC, SF, DC, Boston, LA, Chicago, Seattle) pay significantly more than smaller markets.

Your Navy experience supporting flag officers or commanding officers is high-value experience. Emphasize this heavily—it's executive-level support in high-pressure environment.

**Best for:** Navy Yeomen who supported senior leadership, are detail-oriented with excellent judgment, can handle high-pressure environments, and want career path with significant earning potential and executive visibility.

**Reality check:**
Office manager positions leverage your YN experience managing command administrative operations, supervising junior yeomen, coordinating across departments, and ensuring smooth office workflow.

Entry-level office coordinator positions ($45K-$55K) assist with office operations, vendor coordination, supply ordering, and administrative support. These are stepping stones to office manager roles.

Office manager positions ($52K-$70K) oversee entire office operations: managing admin staff, coordinating facilities, managing budgets, implementing procedures, and serving as point of contact for office operations. These roles require 3-5 years administrative experience and often supervisory experience.

Senior office manager and operations coordinator roles ($65K-$95K) manage complex office operations, multiple office locations, significant budgets, and larger admin teams. These typically require 5-7 years experience and demonstrated leadership.

Director of administration positions ($85K-$120K) lead administrative functions for entire organizations, develop strategy, manage substantial budgets, and report to C-suite. Requires 8-10+ years experience and bachelor's degree minimum.

Professional services (law firms, consulting, accounting), healthcare, technology companies, financial services, and corporate offices all need office managers. Smaller companies (50-200 employees) often have one office manager managing everything. Larger companies have office managers per location or department.

Your Navy experience as leading petty officer managing admin shop translates directly to civilian office manager role. Emphasize supervisory experience, process management, and operational coordination.

**Best for:** Navy Yeomen with supervisory experience (LPO, work center supervisor), who prefer managing operations over providing individual support, and want advancement to management roles.

- Confidential information handling
- Attention to detail and accuracy
- Regulatory compliance and procedures

**Certifications needed:**
- **Paralegal certificate** - ABA-approved paralegal program or post-baccalaureate certificate. Cost: $3,000-$12,000 (often covered by GI Bill). Study: 6 months to 2 years. Required for paralegal positions in most states.
- **NALS Legal Professional (ALP or PLS)** - NALS (National Association of Legal Professionals) certifications for legal secretaries. Cost: $200-$400. Value: Demonstrates legal secretary competency.
- **CAP certification** - Also valuable for legal secretary roles. Cost: $400-$600.
- **Notary Public** - Often required for legal support roles. Cost: $50-$200.

**Reality check:**
Legal secretary and paralegal paths leverage your experience with legal documents, correspondence, strict formatting requirements, deadlines, and confidentiality. If you worked in command legal office or JAG support, this translates exceptionally well.

Legal secretary positions ($40K-$62K) support attorneys with correspondence, document preparation, filing, scheduling, client communication, and administrative tasks. Legal secretary work requires understanding legal terminology, court procedures, and document formatting—more specialized than general administrative assistant.

Paralegal positions ($52K-$95K) conduct legal research, draft legal documents, manage discovery, interview clients, and provide substantive legal support under attorney supervision. Paralegal requires formal education (paralegal certificate or degree) but offers significantly higher pay than legal secretary.

Your Navy experience preparing legal documents, awards, evaluations, and official correspondence demonstrates attention to detail and ability to follow complex formatting requirements—exactly what legal environment demands.

Law firms, corporate legal departments, government legal offices, and public defenders all need legal secretaries and paralegals. Large law firms and corporate legal departments typically pay better than small firms or nonprofit legal organizations.

Consider starting as legal secretary ($48K-$62K) to learn legal environment, then pursue paralegal certificate using GI Bill to move into paralegal role ($65K-$95K). This two-step approach is common and effective.

**Best for:** Navy Yeomen who are extremely detail-oriented, worked with legal documents, enjoy research and writing, and want specialized career with clear advancement path and good pay.

### Project Coordinator / Program Coordinator

- **Project manager:** $75,000-$105,000
- **Senior program manager:** $95,000-$135,000

**What translates directly:**
- Multi-project management and tracking
- Suspense tracking and deadline management
- Stakeholder coordination and communication
- Documentation and reporting
- Meeting coordination and facilitation
- Process management
- Problem-solving and issue resolution
- Resource coordination

**Certifications needed:**
- **CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management)** - PMI's entry-level project management certification. Cost: $300-$500 (exam). Study: 40-60 hours. Good stepping stone to PMP. Opens project coordinator positions.
- **PMP (Project Management Professional)** - PMI's professional certification. Cost: $555 exam. Study: 100+ hours. Requires 3 years experience. Gold-standard for project management. Average salary: $115K.
- **CAP certification** - Valuable for administrative project coordinator roles. Cost: $400-$600.
- **Six Sigma Yellow or Green Belt** - Process improvement methodology. Cost: $200-$1,500. Complements project management skills.

**Reality check:**
Project coordinator roles leverage your YN experience managing multiple concurrent projects (evaluations, awards, reports, correspondence), tracking suspenses, coordinating across departments, and ensuring deadlines are met.

Entry-level project coordinator positions ($48K-$62K) support project managers with scheduling, documentation, status tracking, meeting coordination, and administrative support. These are gateway positions to project management career.

Program coordinator roles ($52K-$68K) coordinate specific programs or initiatives, manage stakeholders, track budgets, document progress, and ensure program deliverables are met. Similar to project coordinator but focused on ongoing programs rather than finite projects.

Senior project coordinator positions ($60K-$80K) manage smaller projects independently or support complex large-scale projects, coordinate across multiple teams, manage project documentation, and often mentor junior coordinators.

Project manager roles ($75K-$105K) lead projects from initiation through closure, manage budgets, lead teams, manage risk, and deliver project outcomes. Requires CAPM or PMP certification and 3-5 years project coordination experience.

Technology, healthcare, consulting, finance, government, and construction all need project coordinators. Technology and consulting typically pay highest. Government contractor project coordinator roles often specifically recruit veterans.

Your Navy experience managing evaluations workflow, awards processing, correspondence tracking, and administrative projects with competing deadlines translates well. Emphasize organizational skills, tracking systems, and deadline management.

**Best for:** Navy Yeomen who are highly organized, enjoy coordinating multiple moving pieces, and want career path leading to project management with high earning potential.

### Federal Government / Defense Contractor (Administrative)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Administrative specialist (federal, GS-0301 or GS-0341 series)
- Secretary (federal, GS-0318 series)
- Program support assistant (federal)
- Administrative assistant (defense contractor)
- Executive assistant (defense contractor)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Federal GS-5 to GS-7 (entry):** $40,000-$55,000
- **Federal GS-9 to GS-11 (experienced):** $60,000-$85,000
- **Federal GS-12 (senior):** $85,000-$105,000
- **Defense contractor admin specialist:** $50,000-$70,000
- **Defense contractor executive assistant:** $65,000-$95,000

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing identical or similar work supporting military or federal operations.

**Certifications needed:**
- **CAP or PACE certifications** - Increase competitiveness for both federal and contractor positions.
- **Security clearance** - If you have active clearance, major advantage for contractor work ($5K-$10K salary premium).
- **Federal-specific training** - Often provided after hiring.

**Reality check:**
Federal civilian administrative positions offer veteran preference hiring (5 or 10 points added to application score—massive advantage), excellent benefits, job security, and pension. Hiring process is slow (3-6 months minimum) but worth it for stability.

Navy Yeomen are highly competitive for federal administrative positions supporting Navy, DoD, DoJ, VA, and other federal agencies. You already know military correspondence, administrative procedures, and regulatory requirements. You speak the language.

GS-7 positions (starting at $50K-$60K depending on locality) are very realistic for separating YNs with 3-5 years experience. Veteran preference makes you extremely competitive. Many YNs start at GS-7 and reach GS-11 ($75K-$85K) within 5-7 years.

Defense contractors (Booz Allen, CACI, Leidos, SAIC, Peraton, General Dynamics) actively recruit separating Yeomen, especially those with security clearances, to support military administrative operations. You can start immediately (no long federal hiring process) and pay is comparable to federal positions.

Navy Personnel Command, NAVSEA, NAVAIR, SPAWAR, and all shore installations hire federal civilian administrative specialists and secretaries. These positions support military operations—familiar environment with mission focus.

Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies all need administrative professionals. Your military experience is valued and often preferred.

**Best for:** Navy Yeomen who want familiar mission-focused work, value job security and federal benefits over maximum salary, prefer supporting military or government missions, and can be patient with federal hiring timeline.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "Yeoman" without context. Translate your Navy YN experience into civilian business language:

|---------------|---------------------|
| Command correspondence management | Managed executive correspondence workflow for 500+ person organization, ensuring 100% on-time delivery |
| Officer evaluations and awards | Prepared performance evaluations and recognition documentation requiring strict formatting and regulatory compliance |
| Classified material handling | Managed classified and confidential information per federal security protocols with zero security incidents |

Use **numbers and metrics**: "Managed correspondence for 500+ person organization," "Coordinated 40+ meetings monthly," "Supervised 5-person admin team," "99%+ accuracy rate."

Translate Navy work to civilian equivalents: "Executive correspondence" not "command correspondence." "Performance evaluations" not "FITREPS." "Senior leadership support" not "CO/XO support."

Drop Navy acronyms entirely. "Federal records management" not "SSIC filing." "Classified information handling" not "SIPR/NIPR management."

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill benefits, prioritized for YN career paths:

### High priority (get these first):

**CAP (Certified Administrative Professional)** - International Association of Administrative Professionals certification. Cost: $400-$600 (exam and study materials). Study time: 60-80 hours. Value: Average salary $63K vs. $47K non-certified (34% increase). Opens administrative specialist, executive assistant, and office manager positions. This should be your #1 priority for civilian administrative career.

**Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) Expert** - Microsoft certification in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook. Cost: $100-$165 per exam (need 2 for Expert certification). Study time: 40-60 hours per exam. Value: Demonstrates advanced Microsoft Office proficiency, which is non-negotiable for administrative roles. Most job postings specifically mention Office proficiency—this certification proves it.

**Associate's or Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, Office Management, or related field** - Use your GI Bill. Many executive assistant, office manager, and specialized administrative positions require bachelor's degree. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 2-4 years depending on credits accepted for military training.

**Notary Public commission** - Required or preferred for many administrative positions, especially legal support and executive assistant roles. Cost: $50-$200 depending on state. Time: 1-2 days. Easy certification with good ROI.

### Medium priority (career-specific):

**PACE (Professional Administrative Certificate of Excellence)** - Microsoft and IAAP partnership certification combining Office proficiency with administrative competency. Cost: $200-$400. Study: 40-60 hours. Good alternative or complement to CAP certification.

**Paralegal certificate** - If pursuing legal secretary/paralegal career path. ABA-approved program or post-baccalaureate certificate. Cost: $3,000-$12,000 (covered by GI Bill). Study: 6 months to 2 years. Required for paralegal positions. Opens $65K-$95K career path.

**CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management)** - If pursuing project coordination career path. PMI's entry-level certification. Cost: $300-$500. Study: 40-60 hours. Opens project coordinator positions ($48K-$68K) and pathway to PMP certification.

**PMP (Project Management Professional)** - PMI's professional certification for project management career. Cost: $555 exam. Study: 100+ hours. Requires 3 years experience. Average salary: $115K. Pursue after 3-5 years project coordination experience. Long-term high-value certification.

### Lower priority (nice to have):

**NALS certifications** (ALP or PLS) - For legal secretary career path. National Association of Legal Professionals credentials. Cost: $200-$400. Value: Demonstrates legal secretary competency but lower priority than paralegal certificate.

**Six Sigma Yellow Belt** - Entry-level process improvement certification. Cost: $200-$500. Study: 20-40 hours. Value: Demonstrates operational excellence mindset, helpful for office manager and operations coordinator roles.

**Advanced Excel training** - Not a certification but critical skill. Free and paid courses available (YouTube, Excel Easy, Udemy, Coursera). Focus on pivot tables, VLOOKUP, formulas, charts, data analysis. Essential for executive assistant, office manager, and project coordinator roles.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be real about where you'll need to adapt:

**Civilian business software:** Navy uses military-specific systems (FLTMPS, NSIPS, SharePoint, Navy correspondence templates). Civilian companies use commercial platforms like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, SharePoint (commercial version), Slack, Asana, Monday.com, and DocuSign. The concepts are similar but interfaces differ. You'll learn on the job—focus on demonstrating proficiency with Microsoft Office Suite, which is universal.

**Corporate culture and communication:** Navy communication is formal and follows strict correspondence formats. Civilian workplace is less formal but requires different communication style—more conversational but still professional, emphasis on collaboration rather than chain of command. You'll adjust within 3-6 months, but be aware.

**Advanced Excel and data skills:** Navy YN work involves basic Word, PowerPoint, and email. Civilian administrative, EA, and office manager roles increasingly require advanced Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, charts, formulas), data analysis, and report generation. Take Excel courses—this is non-negotiable for higher-paying admin roles.

**Project management tools:** Civilian workplaces use project management software (Asana, Monday.com, MS Project, Smartsheet) to track tasks, deadlines, and projects. You understand suspense tracking conceptually—you just need to learn civilian tools. Most are intuitive and you'll learn on the job.

**Professional networking and relationship building:** Navy environment has clear hierarchy and defined relationships. Civilian workplace requires building relationships across functions, networking internally and externally, and influencing without authority. This is soft skill you'll develop over time—be proactive about building relationships in civilian environment.

**Resume and interview skills:** Your resume needs to translate YN work into civilian business language. "Prepared correspondence" is weak. "Managed executive correspondence workflow for 500+ person organization with 100% on-time delivery" gets interviews. Get your resume reviewed by TAPS, veteran employment services, or civilian HR professionals.

## Action plan: your first 90 days out

Here's what to actually do when you separate:

### Month 1: Assessment and documentation

- **Get your DD-214** - Keep 10 copies. Required for veteran preference hiring and education benefits.
- **Document your YN experience with metrics** - How many personnel supported? Correspondence volume? Accuracy rate? Evaluations processed? Projects managed? Quantify everything for resume.
- **Security clearance documentation** - If you have active clearance, get official documentation. Worth $5K-$10K premium for contractor positions.
- **Identify your target career path** - Administrative assistant? Executive assistant? Office manager? Legal secretary/paralegal? Project coordinator? Choose based on which YN duties you enjoyed most.
- **Update your resume** - Translate YN experience using skills translation table. Focus on business outcomes and metrics. Get it reviewed by TAPS, veteran employment specialist, or civilian HR professional.
- **Enroll in GI Bill education program** - If pursuing bachelor's degree or paralegal certificate (both recommended for higher-level positions), start enrollment process. Online programs offer maximum flexibility while working.

### Month 2: Certifications and job search

- **Start CAP certification study program** - Schedule exam 2-3 months out. Study 10-15 hours per week. IAAP offers study materials and practice exams ($200-$300). Many online study programs available.
- **Complete Microsoft Office Specialist certification** - Start with Excel Expert exam, then Word Expert. Cost: $100-$165 per exam. Many online training options (LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, GCFGlobal free). Schedule exams within 4-6 weeks.
- **Take advanced Excel course** - Critical for executive assistant, office manager, and project coordinator roles. Free options: Excel Easy, YouTube. Paid: Udemy ($15-50), LinkedIn Learning. Focus on pivot tables, VLOOKUP, charts, formulas.
- **Set up LinkedIn profile** - Essential for administrative jobs. Include translated YN experience, skills, and certifications in progress. Connect with administrative professionals. Join veteran administrative support groups.
- **Register on USAJOBS.gov** - For federal civilian positions. Set up saved searches for administrative specialist (GS-0301), secretary (GS-0318), administrative officer (GS-0341) positions. Federal hiring is slow but veteran preference gives major advantage.
- **Apply to 20-25 jobs per week** - Target administrative assistant, executive assistant, office coordinator, administrative specialist, or legal secretary roles depending on focus. Quantity matters early—you need interviews to practice.

### Month 3: Interviews, offers, and career launch

- **Tailor your resume for each application** - Match your YN experience to job requirements. If they want "executive support," highlight your CO/XO support with metrics. If they want "office management," emphasize your LPO or administrative operations experience.
- **Prepare for behavioral interviews** - Administrative interviews focus on organization, prioritization, handling pressure, communication, problem-solving, and discretion. Prepare STAR method stories from YN experience.
- **Pass CAP and MOS exams** (if scheduled) - These certifications significantly increase marketability. Prioritize study time. CAP pass rate is approximately 60-70%—take it seriously.
- **Obtain Notary Public commission** - If required in your state for target roles. Quick process (1-2 days) and low cost ($50-$200). Many administrative positions prefer or require notary.
- **Negotiate salary** - Research market rates for your area and position (Glassdoor, Salary.com, Indeed). Your Navy experience supporting senior leadership is valuable—don't undersell. Command-level experience is advanced administrative work. Starting $5K higher means $50K+ more over 10 years.
- **Accept first position strategically** - Prioritize: (1) Learning opportunity and company reputation, (2) Career growth potential and advancement path, (3) Certification/education support, (4) Salary. First civilian job is launching pad—plan strategic move in 2-3 years to higher-level position.
- **Plan ongoing development** - Once employed, map out next certifications (paralegal certificate, CAPM, PMP), degree completion if needed, and career progression. Administrative career offers clear path: Admin Assistant → Executive Assistant → Office Manager → Operations Manager or Chief of Staff.

## Bottom line for Navy YN

Your YN rating isn't just "typing documents and answering phones." You're a trained administrative operations professional with experience managing command-level administration, supporting senior leadership, handling classified information, and coordinating complex administrative functions in high-pressure military environment.

The civilian administrative profession is essential to every organization. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects stable demand for administrative assistants and 7-9% growth for executive assistants and administrative services managers through 2032. Every organization needs skilled administrative professionals—that's literally what you are.

You've already got the foundational skills: executive support, document preparation, correspondence management, calendar coordination, records management, confidential information handling, office procedures, and multi-tasking under pressure. Those are exactly what civilian companies need. Now you need civilian credentials (CAP certification, Microsoft Office certifications, degree if targeting higher roles) and language translation (resume) to prove it.

First-year income of $40K-$55K is realistic for entry-level administrative assistant positions. With CAP certification and 2-3 years experience, $55K-$70K is very achievable. Executive assistant and office manager positions regularly hit $70K-$95K. Senior executive assistants supporting C-suite executives in major corporations earn $85K-$120K+.

Your Navy YN experience is more valuable than you realize. Command-level administrative support is more advanced than most entry-level civilian admin positions. You've supported senior leadership, managed classified information, coordinated complex schedules, and handled high-pressure situations. You're not starting from zero. You're an experienced administrative professional who just needs civilian credentials to formalize what you already know.

Yeomen have direct paths to multiple civilian careers. Administrative assistant opens doors. Executive assistant offers excellent earning potential. Office manager provides leadership opportunities. Legal secretary/paralegal offers specialization. Project coordinator leads to project management career. All are proven paths for former YNs.

Don't undersell yourself. You managed administrative operations for military commands where errors could affect mission readiness. That's advanced administrative work under pressure. You're not entry-level—you're an experienced administrative professional who just needs civilian language and credentials.

Get your CAP certification, translate your experience effectively, and target positions that leverage your command-level experience. The opportunities are there—thousands of former YNs have made successful transitions. You can too.
