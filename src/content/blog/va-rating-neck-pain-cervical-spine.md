# VA Rating for Neck Pain (Cervical Spine): Complete Guide (2025)

Neck pain is one of the most common complaints among veterans—and one of the most valuable VA disability claims. Cervical spine conditions can be rated from 10% to 100%, and when you add secondary radiculopathy ratings, total compensation can reach $3,000+ per month.

This guide covers everything you need to maximize your cervical spine claim.

## How the VA Rates Cervical Spine Conditions

The VA rates all cervical spine conditions under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (38 CFR § 4.71a). Your rating depends primarily on your range of motion—how far you can move your neck.

### Cervical Spine Rating Criteria

| Rating | Monthly Pay (2025) | Range of Motion Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **10%** | $175.51 | Forward flexion greater than 30° but not greater than 40°, OR combined ROM greater than 170° but not greater than 335°, OR muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or spinal contour |
| **20%** | $357.03 | Forward flexion greater than 15° but not greater than 30°, OR combined ROM not greater than 170°, OR muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour |
| **30%** | $524.31 | Forward flexion 15° or less, OR favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine |
| **40%** | $755.28 | Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine |
| **100%** | $3,906.04 | Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine |

### Understanding the Criteria

**Forward Flexion**: How far you can bend your chin toward your chest
- Normal: 45°
- 30% rating: 15° or less

**Combined Range of Motion**: Total of forward flexion + extension + left lateral flexion + right lateral flexion + left rotation + right rotation
- Normal combined ROM: 340°
- 20% rating: 170° or less

**Ankylosis**: Complete immobility of the spine (fused)
- Favorable: Fixed in neutral position
- Unfavorable: Fixed in flexion or extension (worse)

### Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Formula

If you have disc problems causing incapacitating episodes, you may be rated under the IVDS formula instead (if it results in a higher rating):

| Rating | Incapacitating Episodes Per Year |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| 10% | At least 1 week but less than 2 weeks |
| 20% | At least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks |
| 40% | At least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks |
| 60% | At least 6 weeks |

**Incapacitating episode**: Period of acute signs/symptoms requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.

**Important**: You'll be rated under whichever formula gives you the higher rating—general spine formula or IVDS formula.

## Proving Service Connection

### Direct Service Connection

To prove your neck condition is directly connected to service:

**Evidence needed:**
1. Current cervical spine diagnosis (from imaging and clinical exam)
2. In-service event, injury, or condition
3. Medical nexus connecting current condition to service

**Common in-service causes:**
- **Vehicle accidents** - Most common cause, especially IED blasts
- **Parachuting** - Airborne operations stress cervical spine
- **Carrying heavy loads** - Rucking, equipment, body armor
- **Combat trauma** - Direct injuries to head/neck
- **Training injuries** - Falls, combatives, obstacle courses
- **Repetitive stress** - Looking up at aircraft, carrying weapons
- **Poor ergonomics** - Sleeping positions in the field

**In-service documentation:**
- Sick call visits for neck pain
- Physical therapy referrals
- X-rays or MRIs during service
- Limited duty profiles
- Line of duty determinations

### Secondary Service Connection

Neck conditions are often secondary to other service-connected disabilities:

**TBI → Cervical Spine**
- Whiplash mechanism often accompanies head injury
- Many TBI-causing events also damage neck

**Lumbar Spine → Cervical Spine**
- Compensating for back pain affects neck alignment
- Altered posture stresses cervical spine

**Shoulder Conditions → Cervical Spine**
- Guarding and changed movement patterns
- Referred pain patterns

**PTSD → Cervical Spine**
- Chronic muscle tension from hypervigilance
- Bruxism (teeth grinding) affects neck muscles

### Filing Secondary Claims

If you're already service-connected for another condition that's causing or worsening your neck pain:

1. File neck condition as secondary to primary condition
2. Get nexus letter explaining the biomechanical connection
3. Provide documentation of how primary condition affects your neck

## Radiculopathy: The Key Secondary Claim

If your cervical spine condition causes nerve symptoms in your arms, you can claim cervical radiculopathy as a secondary condition—and get separate ratings for each affected extremity.

### Radiculopathy Rating Criteria (Upper Extremity)

**Dominant Arm:**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | 20% |
| Moderate | 40% |
| Severe | 50% |

**Non-Dominant Arm:**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | 20% |
| Moderate | 30% |
| Severe | 40% |

### Radiculopathy Symptoms

To claim radiculopathy, document these symptoms in your arms/hands:
- Shooting pain from neck into arm
- Numbness or tingling
- Burning sensation
- Weakness
- Reduced grip strength
- Muscle atrophy (in severe cases)

### How to Document Radiculopathy

1. **Describe symptoms clearly**: "I have constant tingling in my right thumb and first two fingers, with shooting pain down my right arm when I turn my head"

2. **Get diagnostic testing**:
   - EMG (electromyography) shows nerve damage
   - Nerve conduction study measures nerve function
   - MRI shows disc herniation pressing on nerves

3. **Map symptoms to specific nerves**: The examiner will check which nerve root is affected (C5, C6, C7, etc.) based on symptom pattern

### Radiculopathy Combined Rating Example

**Veteran with cervical spine + bilateral radiculopathy:**
- Cervical spine (20% limitation of motion): 20%
- Right upper extremity radiculopathy (moderate, dominant): 40%
- Left upper extremity radiculopathy (mild): 20%
- **Combined rating: 61%** (rounds to 60%)

This is why radiculopathy claims are so important—they can more than double your compensation.

## C&P Exam for Cervical Spine

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about history and current symptoms
3. **Measure range of motion** (critical)
4. Test for neurological symptoms
5. Assess functional impairment
6. Provide nexus opinion

### Range of Motion Testing

The examiner will measure:
- **Forward flexion** (chin to chest)
- **Extension** (looking up)
- **Left lateral flexion** (ear to shoulder)
- **Right lateral flexion** (ear to shoulder)
- **Left rotation** (turning head left)
- **Right rotation** (turning head right)

**Critical**: The examiner must document where pain begins. Your rating can be based on painful motion, not just physical limitation.

### The DeLuca Factors

Under DeLuca v. Brown, the VA must consider:
- Pain during movement
- Weakness
- Fatigue
- Lack of endurance
- Flare-ups

**Always discuss flare-ups**:
- How often do they occur?
- What triggers them?
- How do symptoms change during flare-ups?
- How does it affect your function?

### Neurological Testing

If you're claiming radiculopathy, the examiner will:
- Test strength in arms/hands
- Check sensation in specific patterns
- Test reflexes
- Look for muscle atrophy
- Review any EMG/nerve conduction studies

### What to Tell the Examiner

**Describe your worst days:**
- "During flare-ups, I can barely turn my head to check my mirrors while driving"
- "The pain radiates down my right arm constantly"
- "I get headaches from neck tension every day"

**Don't push through pain:**
- Stop movement when pain begins
- Tell the examiner "this is where the pain stops me"
- Don't try to demonstrate full range of motion if it hurts

**Mention all symptoms:**
- Stiffness
- Grinding/crepitus
- Headaches from neck
- Arm numbness/tingling
- Weakness
- Sleep disruption

### What to Bring

- Any imaging reports (MRI, X-ray, CT)
- EMG/nerve conduction results
- List of current symptoms
- Notes on flare-up frequency
- Cervical collar or other devices you use

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Imaging studies**:
   - X-rays showing degenerative changes
   - MRI showing disc herniations, stenosis
   - CT scan if applicable

2. **Diagnosis documentation**:
   - Degenerative disc disease
   - Cervical spondylosis
   - Herniated disc
   - Cervical stenosis
   - Cervical strain/sprain

3. **Range of motion measurements**:
   - From physical therapist or orthopedist
   - In degrees for each movement
   - Documented pain points

4. **Treatment records**:
   - Physical therapy notes
   - Pain management visits
   - Surgical consultations
   - Injection records

### For Radiculopathy

5. **EMG/Nerve conduction studies**: Objective evidence of nerve damage

6. **Neurological exam findings**: Weakness, numbness patterns

7. **Imaging showing nerve compression**: MRI with disc herniation at specific level

### Lay Evidence

8. **Personal statement**:
   - How injury occurred
   - Current symptoms
   - Impact on daily activities
   - Flare-up description

9. **Buddy statements**:
   - Witnessed injury
   - Observed limitations
   - Before/after comparison

## Secondary Conditions FROM Cervical Spine

If your cervical spine is service-connected, consider claiming:

### Cervical Radiculopathy
- Most important secondary claim
- Rated separately for each arm affected
- Can significantly increase overall rating

### Headaches/Migraines
- Cervicogenic headaches from neck problems
- Rated 0-50% under DC 8100

### TMJ Disorder
- Neck problems can cause jaw issues
- Rated under DC 9905

### Depression/Anxiety
- Chronic pain affects mental health
- Rated under mental health formula

### Sleep Disorders
- Pain disrupts sleep
- Can be rated separately

### Thoracic Spine
- Cervical problems can extend to upper back
- Rated under same spine formula

## Common Denial Reasons and Solutions

### "No nexus to service"
**Solution**: Get nexus letter specifically addressing how your service activities caused cervical spine damage.

### "Range of motion doesn't meet criteria"
**Solution**: Request examination during flare-up, or provide documentation showing pain limits motion before physical limit.

### "No current diagnosis"
**Solution**: Get imaging (X-ray/MRI) to document degenerative changes.

### "Attributed to aging"
**Solution**: Get medical opinion explaining why your condition is beyond normal aging for your age, citing in-service stressors.

## Increasing Your Cervical Spine Rating

### When to File for Increase

- Range of motion has decreased
- New imaging shows progression
- Radiculopathy has developed or worsened
- You've had surgery
- Flare-ups are more frequent

### Tips for Higher Rating

1. **Get current imaging** - Shows progression
2. **Document radiculopathy** - EMG testing is key
3. **Describe flare-ups in detail** - Frequency, severity, triggers
4. **Note functional limitations** - Can't drive, work at computer, etc.
5. **Update buddy statements** - Current impact on daily life

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get rated for neck pain without a herniated disc?
Yes. Degenerative disc disease, cervical strain, and other conditions are all ratable based on limitation of motion.

### What if my X-ray is "normal"?
You can still be rated based on painful motion and functional limitation. MRI may show soft tissue problems X-rays miss.

### Is radiculopathy rated separately from neck?
Yes. Radiculopathy affecting each arm is rated separately, in addition to your cervical spine rating.

### Can I claim neck pain secondary to lumbar spine?
Yes. Altered posture and gait from back problems commonly cause neck issues.

### What's the average neck rating?
Most veterans receive 10-20% for cervical spine alone. Adding radiculopathy ratings can push total compensation much higher.

### Do I need surgery to get a high rating?
No. Ratings are based on range of motion and symptoms, not treatment received.

## 2025 Compensation Rates

| Rating | Veteran Alone | With Spouse | With Spouse + Child |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 10% | $175.51 | $175.51 | $175.51 |
| 20% | $357.03 | $398.03 | $436.03 |
| 30% | $524.31 | $586.31 | $633.31 |
| 40% | $755.28 | $838.28 | $897.28 |

## Bottom Line

Cervical spine claims are valuable—especially when combined with radiculopathy secondaries. A veteran with 20% cervical spine plus moderate radiculopathy in one arm is already at 53% combined.

Key steps:
1. Get current imaging (MRI preferred)
2. Document range of motion limitations
3. Claim radiculopathy if you have arm symptoms
4. Get EMG testing for radiculopathy
5. Don't minimize symptoms at C&P exam
6. Describe flare-ups in detail

Your neck pain is real. It came from service. Get compensated.
