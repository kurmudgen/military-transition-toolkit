# Finding Remote Work That Survives PCS Moves: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Remote work offers military spouses the **career continuity** that traditional employment can't provide. But not all remote jobs survive PCS moves—many are location-restricted due to taxes, licensing, or company policy. This guide shows you how to find **truly portable remote work** that follows you to any duty station, including OCONUS. Focus on companies with **nationwide hiring**, understand the tax implications, and build skills that work anywhere.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

The average military family moves **every 2-3 years**. Traditional employment means:
- Starting over at each duty station
- Losing seniority and benefits
- Gaps between jobs during transitions
- Career stagnation despite qualifications

**Remote work solves this**—if you choose the right kind of remote.

## Types of Remote Work

### Fully Remote (Location-Flexible)

**What It Means:**
- Work from anywhere in the U.S.
- Some allow international
- No office visits required
- Company set up for distributed workforce

**Best For Military Spouses:** Yes—career survives any PCS

### Remote (Location-Restricted)

**What It Means:**
- Work from home, but specific state/region
- May require proximity to office
- Tax and licensing restrictions
- Could lose job if you move

**Watch Out:** Many "remote" jobs are actually location-restricted

### Hybrid Remote

**What It Means:**
- Some office time required
- Usually 2-3 days/week in office
- Must live near company location

**For Military Spouses:** Only works at current duty station

## Finding Truly Portable Remote Jobs

### Step 1: Read Job Postings Carefully

**Look For:**
- "Work from anywhere in the U.S."
- "All 50 states"
- "Distributed company"
- "Location-flexible"
- No specific state listed

**Red Flags:**
- Specific state or region mentioned
- "Remote - [City/State]"
- "Near headquarters preferred"
- "Occasional office visits required"

### Step 2: Ask During Application/Interview

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Is this position open to all 50 states?"
- "What happens if I need to relocate?"
- "Are there any location restrictions?"
- "Do you have employees in [potential future state]?"
- "What's your policy on OCONUS employees?"

### Step 3: Review Offer Letter Carefully

**Before Accepting:**
- Check for location restrictions in contract
- Understand tax withholding setup
- Ask about relocation policies
- Get answers in writing
