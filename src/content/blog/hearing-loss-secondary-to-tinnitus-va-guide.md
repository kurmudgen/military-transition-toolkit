# Hearing Loss Secondary to Tinnitus: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - But typically same cause as tinnitus
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 0-100% (based on audiogram)
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected tinnitus, audiogram, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** High (70%+) with documented hearing loss

If you have service-connected tinnitus and have developed measurable hearing loss, you can claim hearing loss as secondary. Both conditions typically share the same underlying cause—noise exposure that damaged the auditory system.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For hearing loss secondary to tinnitus:
- Your tinnitus must be service-connected
- You must have measurable hearing loss meeting VA criteria
- Both result from same noise exposure/damage

## Understanding the Relationship

### Same Cause, Different Manifestations

**Noise-Induced Damage Causes Both:**
- Cochlear hair cell damage → hearing loss
- Aberrant neural signals → tinnitus
- Same underlying pathology

### Why Claim as Secondary?

**Common Scenarios:**
1. Tinnitus was obvious; hearing loss was subtle initially
2. Hearing loss developed/worsened after tinnitus rated
3. Initial claim only addressed tinnitus

**Strategy:**
- If tinnitus already service-connected
- And hearing loss now meets VA criteria
- Claim hearing loss secondary to same damage

## VA Hearing Loss Criteria

### What VA Considers "Disability"

**Hearing Loss for VA Purposes (38 CFR § 3.385):**

Impaired hearing is a disability when ANY of the following exist in at least one ear:
- Pure tone threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz is 40 dB or greater
- Pure tone thresholds at THREE of those frequencies is 26 dB or greater
- Speech recognition (Maryland CNC) is 94% or less

**You must meet these criteria to have ratable hearing loss.**

### Hearing Loss Rating (DC 6100)

Ratings are based on a complex table using:
- Pure tone threshold average (500-4000 Hz)
- Speech discrimination score (Maryland CNC)
- Each ear rated separately then combined

**Rating Range:**
| Rating | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| 0% | Mild hearing loss meeting VA criteria |
| 10% | Moderate hearing loss |
| 20-30% | Moderate-severe |
| 40-60% | Severe |
| 70-100% | Profound hearing loss |

**Most veterans rate 0-10% for hearing loss unless severe.**

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Tinnitus:**
- Service connection documentation
- Original claim information
- Noise exposure documentation

**For Hearing Loss:**
- Current audiogram (within 1 year)
- Speech discrimination testing (Maryland CNC)
- Prior audiograms if available (shows progression)

### Audiogram Requirements

**Must Include:**
- Pure tone thresholds: 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz
- Each ear tested separately
- Speech recognition percentage (Maryland CNC test)
- Performed by qualified audiologist

### The Nexus Letter

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for tinnitus at 10%.*

*Current audiogram demonstrates:*
*Right ear: Pure tone average [X] dB, Speech discrimination [X]%*
*Left ear: Pure tone average [X] dB, Speech discrimination [X]%*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is at least as likely as not caused by the same noise exposure that caused the service-connected tinnitus.*

*Medical Rationale: Tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss share common etiology. Noise exposure damages cochlear hair cells, resulting in both hearing loss and the aberrant neural activity perceived as tinnitus. The configuration of [Veteran's] hearing loss (high-frequency sloping pattern) is characteristic of noise-induced hearing loss, consistent with the already service-connected tinnitus. Both conditions represent different manifestations of the same underlying cochlear damage."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Get Current Audiogram

Have comprehensive hearing test:
- VA audiology or private audiologist
- Must include speech discrimination (Maryland CNC)
- Within 1 year of claim

### Step 2: Verify Hearing Loss Meets VA Criteria

Check audiogram against 38 CFR § 3.385:
- Any threshold 40 dB or greater?
- Three thresholds 26 dB or greater?
- Speech recognition 94% or less?

### Step 3: Document Progression

If possible, show:
- Hearing was better previously
- Progressive loss over time
- Correlation with tinnitus timeline

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get audiologist opinion:
- Connect to same noise exposure
- Cost: $300-$800

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Include audiogram
- Link to tinnitus

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- VA audiological exam likely
- Another audiogram performed
- This determines your rating

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Old audiogram** - Must be recent (within 1 year)

2. **Wrong speech test** - Must be Maryland CNC, not other tests

3. **Not meeting criteria** - Verify loss meets VA standards

4. **Missing nexus** - Still need medical connection

5. **Not claiming both ears** - Each ear rated

6. **Ignoring 0% rating** - Service connection still valuable

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Progressive Hearing Loss

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, tinnitus 10%
- Hearing gradually worsening
- Now meets VA criteria
- High-frequency loss pattern

**Evidence:**
- Current audiogram meeting criteria
- Comparison to earlier audiograms
- Nexus linking to same noise exposure

**Outcome:** 10% for bilateral hearing loss
**Combined Rating:** 10% → 20%

### Case Study 2: Asymmetric Hearing Loss

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, tinnitus 10%
- Left ear worse than right
- Weapons firing from right shoulder
- Pattern consistent with noise exposure

**Evidence:**
- Audiogram showing asymmetric loss
- Nexus explaining pattern
- Military occupational specialty documented

**Outcome:** 10% for hearing loss
**Combined Rating:** 10% → 20%

### Case Study 3: Severe Hearing Loss

**Background:** 60-year-old veteran, tinnitus 10%
- Profound hearing loss developed
- Requires hearing aids
- Speech discrimination poor

**Evidence:**
- Audiogram showing severe loss
- Hearing aid prescription
- Nexus from audiologist

**Outcome:** 40% for hearing loss
**Combined Rating:** 10% → 46% (rounds to 50%)

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Hearing Loss 0% (Service Connection Only):**
- Value: Opens door to hearing aids from VA
- Future claims if hearing worsens
- Establishes connection

**Hearing Loss 10%:**
- Before: 10% tinnitus = $171.23
- Add 10% hearing loss = 19% → rounds to 20%
- After: $327.99
- Increase: $156.76/month

**Hearing Loss 40%:**
- Before: 10% tinnitus
- Add 40% hearing loss = 46% → rounds to 50%
- After: $1,041.82
- Significant increase

## Benefits of 0% Rating

Even at 0%, service-connected hearing loss provides:
- **Hearing aids** from VA at no cost
- **Batteries and repairs** covered
- **Future increases** if hearing worsens
- **Other secondary claims** (depression from hearing loss, etc.)

## Understanding Hearing Loss Ratings

### The Rating Tables

VA uses Tables VI and VIA to convert audiogram results to Roman numerals (I-XI) for each ear, then Table VII to determine percentage.

**Simplified:**
- Better hearing = lower rating
- Worse hearing = higher rating
- Both ears considered
- Speech discrimination heavily weighted

### Why Most Get 0-10%

- Hearing loss must be quite significant to rate high
- Speech discrimination is key factor
- Many veterans with hearing loss still rate 0%
- 0% still means service-connected

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Hearing loss doesn't meet criteria"** - Check 38 CFR § 3.385
2. **"No nexus to tinnitus"** - Add medical opinion
3. **"Audiogram incomplete"** - Ensure Maryland CNC included

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- New audiogram if hearing has worsened
- Add nexus letter
- Ensure proper testing protocol used

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I have tinnitus but my hearing is "normal"—can I claim?**
A: Only if hearing loss meets VA criteria (38 CFR § 3.385).

**Q: What's the difference between 0% and denial?**
A: 0% means service-connected (benefits like hearing aids). Denial means no connection established.

**Q: Can hearing loss get worse and rating increase?**
A: Yes. File for increase if hearing deteriorates.

**Q: Do hearing aids affect my rating?**
A: Rating is based on uncorrected hearing. Aids don't change rating.

**Q: Why is my rating lower than I expected?**
A: VA tables are strict. Many significant losses rate 0-10%.

**Q: Can I get hearing aids if rated 0%?**
A: Yes! Service-connected hearing loss at any rating qualifies for VA-provided aids.

**Q: What if C&P exam shows different results than my audiogram?**
A: VA uses their exam results. If significantly different, request retest.
