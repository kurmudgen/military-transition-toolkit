**Military:** Mission before self
**Corporate:** Self-promotion valued
**Management Approach:** Coach on self-advocacy and visibility strategies

## Effective Management Strategies

### 1. Provide Clear Structure & Expectations

✅ **Set clear objectives:** SMART goals, defined success criteria
✅ **Explain "why":** Veterans excel when they understand mission/purpose
✅ **Define decision authority:** What can they decide vs. escalate?
✅ **Clarify processes:** Step-by-step, documented SOPs
✅ **Establish communication cadence:** Regular 1:1s, team meetings, updates

---

### 2. Direct & Honest Communication

✅ **Be direct:** Veterans appreciate clarity and honesty
✅ **Provide frequent feedback:** Don't wait for annual reviews
✅ **Be specific:** "Great job" insufficient; explain what and why
✅ **Address issues promptly:** Don't let problems linger
✅ **Explain context:** Help them understand corporate dynamics

**Example:**
❌ "Your presentation could use some work."
✅ "Your content was strong, but executives here prefer fewer slides with more visuals and a clear recommendation at the start. Let me show you some examples."

---

### 3. Leverage Their Leadership

✅ **Give them leadership opportunities early:** They're ready
✅ **Assign team lead or project management roles:** Natural fit
✅ **Use them for training and mentoring:** They excel at developing people
✅ **Crisis management:** Tap into their high-pressure experience
✅ **Process improvement:** Military excels at efficiency and optimization

---

### 4. Coach on Corporate Culture

✅ **Teach unwritten rules explicitly:** Don't assume they'll figure it out
✅ **Explain corporate politics:** How to navigate without command authority
✅ **Model self-promotion:** Show how to advocate without being arrogant
✅ **Demonstrate influence strategies:** Stakeholder management, consensus-building
✅ **Normalize ambiguity:** "It's okay not to have all the answers here"

---

## Performance Management

### Setting Expectations

**Best Practices:**
- **Write it down:** Clear objectives, metrics, deadlines
- **Quantify success:** "Improve by 15%" not "Do better"
- **Explain evaluation criteria:** How will performance be judged?
- **Discuss career impact:** How does this role lead to advancement?
- **Revisit regularly:** Expectations evolve; keep them updated

---

### Providing Feedback

**Do's:**
✅ Frequent (weekly or bi-weekly check-ins)
✅ Specific and actionable ("Do this" not "Be better")
✅ Balanced (strengths and growth areas)
✅ Direct and clear (no corporate code-speak)
✅ Forward-looking (how to improve going forward)

**Don'ts:**
❌ Annual feedback only
❌ Vague ("You need to be more strategic")
❌ Sandwich method (confusing)
❌ Indirect (veterans miss subtle cues)
❌ Surprise criticism in reviews

**Feedback Framework:**
1. **Context:** "In yesterday's meeting..."
2. **Behavior:** "When you challenged John directly in front of the CEO..."
3. **Impact:** "It made him defensive and shut down the conversation..."
4. **Alternative:** "In our culture, the more effective approach is to ask questions in the meeting, then discuss concerns 1:1 after..."
5. **Check understanding:** "Does that make sense? What questions do you have?"

---

### Performance Reviews

---

### Development Strategies

- "Promotions typically happen annually in Q1 based on prior year performance"
- "To advance to [next level], you need to demonstrate [specific capabilities]"
- "Let's build a development plan to get you there"

**Advocate for Them:**
- Veterans often undersell themselves
- You must advocate in talent reviews and promotion discussions
- Translate military accomplishments for senior leadership

## Addressing Challenges

### Challenge 1: Overly Formal or Rigid

**Symptom:** Excessive formality, rigid adherence to rules, difficulty with ambiguity

**Approach:**
- Acknowledge military background shapes this
- Explain corporate flexibility and ambiguity
- Give permission to be flexible ("It's okay if...")
- Model adaptive decision-making
- Coach through ambiguous scenarios

**Example:** "I know the handbook says X, but in practice, we're more flexible. Here's how people typically handle this situation..."

---

### Challenge 2: Difficulty with Self-Promotion

**Symptom:** Doesn't share accomplishments, downplays contributions, attributes success to team

**Approach:**
- Explain corporate visibility requirements
- Teach how to share accomplishments without arrogance
- Model appropriate self-promotion
- Coach on stakeholder communication
- Create opportunities for them to present work

**Example:** "I need you to send a weekly update email to stakeholders highlighting our progress. It's not bragging—it's keeping people informed. Here's a template..."

---

### Challenge 3: Too Direct/Blunt

**Symptom:** Challenges people directly in meetings, gives blunt feedback, appears tactless

**Approach:**
- Appreciate honesty and directness
- Explain corporate communication norms
- Teach diplomatic approaches
- Provide specific alternatives
- Practice scenarios together

**Example:** "Your point was valid, but the delivery shut people down. Next time, try framing it as a question: 'Have we considered X risk?' vs. 'This won't work because of X.'"

---

### Challenge 4: Underemployment/Boredom

**Symptom:** Overqualified for role, not challenged, disengaged, looking for more responsibility

**Approach:**
- Assess fit honestly
- Provide stretch assignments immediately
- Accelerate advancement timeline if possible
- Discuss role change or promotion
- Don't lose them due to underutilization

**Example:** "I recognize you're capable of more. Let's talk about expanding your scope and timeline for advancement."

---

### Challenge 5: Compensation Dissatisfaction

**Symptom:** Discovers they're underpaid relative to market/peers, feels taken advantage of

**Approach:**
- Be transparent about compensation philosophy
- Review market data together
- Discuss promotion and raise timeline
- Advocate for adjustment if genuinely underpaid
- Don't lose strong performer to avoidable pay issue

**Example:** "I hear your concern. Let me review your compensation against market and peers. If there's a gap, I'll advocate for an adjustment."
