# C&P Exam Tips: 15 Things Every Veteran Should Know (2025)

The Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam is often the most important appointment in your VA disability claim. The examiner's findings and opinions largely determine your rating—and your monthly compensation for years to come.

These 15 tips will help you get the accurate assessment you deserve.

## Before the Exam

### 1. Don't Miss Your Appointment

**Why it matters:** Missing your C&P exam typically results in claim denial or rating based solely on existing evidence (usually unfavorable).

**What to do:**
- Mark the date immediately when you receive notice
- Confirm the location—it may not be at your usual VA facility
- Plan for traffic and parking
- If you absolutely cannot attend, reschedule in advance

**If you miss it:** Call immediately to reschedule. Provide a valid reason. One missed exam can be rescheduled; multiple misses look bad.

### 2. Know What Condition(s) You're Being Examined For

**Why it matters:** Examiners only evaluate conditions on their assignment. If you have 5 claimed conditions, you might have 5 different exams.

**What to do:**
- Check your exam notification for the specific condition(s)
- Prepare information specific to those conditions
- If a condition isn't on the list, bring it up at the beginning—but understand they may not be able to evaluate it

### 3. Review Your Medical Records

**Why it matters:** You should know what's already documented. The examiner will reference these records.

**What to do:**
- Request copies of your VA medical records
- Review service treatment records
- Note any inconsistencies you need to address
- Ensure recent records are in the system

### 4. Prepare Written Notes

**Why it matters:** Anxiety and pain can make you forget important details during the exam.

**What to do:**
- Write down all symptoms for each condition
- Note frequency, severity, and duration
- List specific examples of how conditions affect daily life
- Document flare-up information
- **You can bring these notes and reference them during the exam**

### 5. Gather Buddy Statements Before the Exam

**Why it matters:** Third-party observations add credibility to your claim.

**What to do:**
- Get statements from spouse, family, coworkers, or fellow veterans
- Have them describe observable symptoms and limitations
- Include specific examples and timeframes
- Submit these with your claim before the exam

## During the Exam

### 6. Be Honest—Don't Exaggerate or Minimize

**Why it matters:** Examiners are trained to detect inconsistencies. Exaggeration destroys credibility. Minimization results in lower ratings.

**What to do:**
- Describe your actual symptoms accurately
- Don't try to "perform" worse than reality
- Don't be stoic or downplay symptoms out of pride
- Remember: honest accuracy is the goal

### 7. Describe Your Worst Days, Not Your Best

**Why it matters:** Many veterans describe how they feel on good days, resulting in underrating.

**What to do:**
- Say: "Today is actually a pretty good day. On my worst days, I [describe]"
- Quantify: "About 3 days a week, I can barely get out of bed"
- Be specific: "Last week, I had a flare-up that lasted 3 days where I couldn't [activity]"

### 8. Don't Push Through Pain

**Why it matters:** For musculoskeletal exams, the examiner measures where pain begins, not maximum physical capability.

**What to do:**
- Stop movement when significant pain starts
- Say: "This is where the pain really kicks in"
- Don't try to impress the examiner with your toughness
- The VA rates functional limitation from pain

### 9. Mention Flare-Ups

**Why it matters:** The VA must consider periods when your condition is worse than baseline.

**What to do:**
- Describe how often flare-ups occur
- Explain how long they last
- Describe severity compared to baseline
- Explain what you can't do during flare-ups
- The examiner should estimate your function during flare-ups

### 10. Use Specific Examples

**Why it matters:** Vague statements are less compelling than concrete examples.

**Instead of:** "My back hurts a lot."
**Say:** "Last week I had to leave work early twice because the pain was unbearable. I can't sit for more than 30 minutes without getting up. My wife has to help me put on my socks."

### 11. Explain Impact on Daily Life and Work

**Why it matters:** Ratings are based on occupational and social impairment.

**What to do:**
- Describe how the condition affects your job
- Explain limitations on daily activities (dressing, hygiene, household tasks)
- Discuss impact on relationships and social activities
- Mention any accommodations you need

### 12. Ask Questions If Unclear

**Why it matters:** You need to fully understand what's being asked to give accurate answers.

**What to do:**
- If a question is confusing, ask for clarification
- Make sure you're answering what they actually asked
- Don't guess—ask

## After the Exam

### 13. Request a Copy of the DBQ

**Why it matters:** The Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) is what the rating authority uses. Errors can be challenged.

**What to do:**
- Request your exam report through VA records
- Review for accuracy
- Note any errors or omissions
- Use this information for appeals if needed

### 14. Document What Happened

**Why it matters:** Your memory of the exam may be important for appeals.

**What to do:**
- Immediately after the exam, write down:
  - Questions asked
  - Your answers
  - Tests performed
  - Duration of exam
  - Examiner's demeanor
  - Anything unusual

### 15. Know Your Appeal Options

**Why it matters:** An unfavorable exam result isn't the end.

**Options:**
- **Supplemental Claim**: Submit new evidence (like a private medical opinion)
- **Higher Level Review**: Request senior VA reviewer examine the decision
- **Board Appeal**: Formal appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals

## Bonus Tips

### What to Wear

- Comfortable clothing you can move in
- For joint exams: shorts or loose pants, short sleeves
- Bring any braces, assistive devices, or adaptive equipment you use

### What to Bring

- Photo ID
- List of current medications
- List of all doctors/providers
- Written notes on symptoms
- Any assistive devices you use
- Records not yet in VA system

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't** take extra pain medication before the exam
- **Don't** stretch or warm up for musculoskeletal exams
- **Don't** dress up or try to look better than you normally do
- **Don't** bring an attitude—stay calm and cooperative
- **Don't** argue with the examiner—just answer questions accurately

### Special Situations

**Bad pain day?** Go anyway—this shows your actual condition.

**Good day?** Tell the examiner: "Today I feel better than usual."

**Examiner seems rushed?** Speak up: "I'd also like to mention..."

**Forgot something?** You can send additional statements after the exam.

## Common C&P Exam Myths

**Truth**: Exaggeration destroys credibility. Be honestly accurate.

**Myth**: "I should be stoic and tough it out."
**Truth**: Minimizing symptoms results in lower ratings.

**Myth**: "All C&P examiners are trying to deny my claim."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does a C&P exam take?
Varies by condition: 15 minutes for simple conditions, 60-90 minutes for complex mental health evaluations.

### Can I bring someone with me?

### What if I disagree with something the examiner says?
Don't argue. Just provide your accurate information. You can address disagreements in appeals.

### Should I bring my own doctor's opinion?
Having a private nexus letter helps, especially for appeals. But the C&P examiner will form their own opinion.

### How soon after the exam will I get results?
Typically 2-8 weeks, but can vary.
