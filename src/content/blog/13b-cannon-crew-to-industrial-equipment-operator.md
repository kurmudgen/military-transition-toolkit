## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1:** Not emphasizing safety record. Manufacturing companies prioritize safety. Highlight zero-incident history.

**Mistake #2:** Limiting search geographically. Best opportunities might require relocation. Consider geographic flexibility.

**Mistake #3:** Joining non-union when union option available. Union operators earn 20-30% more with better benefits and pension.

**Mistake #4:** Not pursuing supervisor track if you have leadership goals. Stay engaged and pursue advancement after 2-3 years operator experience.

**Mistake #5:** Not considering shift differentials in salary. Midnight shift work adds $5K-$15K annually in premiums. Factor into total compensation.

## Bottom Line for 13B Operators

Your equipment operation and maintenance expertise is **directly valuable in industrial manufacturing** where specialized equipment operation is critical.

Transition path: Apply to plants/operators, pass background check, attend equipment training (company provides, 2-4 weeks paid), start earning $50K-$65K immediately.

Within 3-5 years: $80K-$110K as senior operator or supervisor depending on advancement choice.

With advancement to management: $100K-$140K+ within 10-15 years.

Manufacturing and energy sectors face skilled worker shortage. Your military discipline and equipment expertise are highly valued.

Benefits: Many plants union with pensions, excellent health insurance, stable employment, overtime opportunities, shift differentials.

Your 13B expertise isn't a military skill to translate - it's foundation for 20+ year manufacturing career earning $60K-$130K+.
