## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 25R Visual Information Equipment Operator-Maintainers—you've operated and maintained the audiovisual equipment that supports military briefings, training, public affairs, and command communications. Your **hands-on experience with professional video production equipment, audio systems, broadcast technology, live event production, video editing systems, projectors and displays, camera operation, and troubleshooting AV equipment** translates directly to civilian AV technician, broadcast technician, video production, and event technology roles. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$60,000** for entry-level AV technicians or production assistants, scaling to **$60,000-$85,000** for experienced AV technicians or broadcast technicians, and **$75,000-$115,000+** for senior AV specialists, broadcast engineers, or production managers. Federal civilian visual information equipment specialist positions (GS-9 to GS-13) offer **$60,000-$140,000** with locality adjustments and excellent benefits.

Your 25R experience provides practical technical skills that corporate AV departments, event production companies, broadcast facilities, and entertainment venues need. You've operated professional video cameras, configured audio mixing consoles, set up projection and display systems, troubleshot equipment failures during live events, maintained broadcast-quality equipment, recorded and edited video, and provided technical support for high-stakes presentations where equipment failure would have affected mission outcomes. You understand signal flow, audio/video standards, equipment connectivity, and systematic troubleshooting—technical knowledge developed through hands-on operational experience, not just classroom training.

The AV and broadcast industries need skilled technicians. Corporate events, conferences, hybrid meetings, live streaming, broadcast production, houses of worship, educational institutions, and entertainment venues all require professionals who can set up, operate, and maintain audiovisual systems. The growth of virtual events, live streaming, and hybrid work environments creates steady demand for AV professionals who can deliver reliable, high-quality technical support.

## What Does an Army 25R Actually Do?

As a 25R, you've operated and maintained visual information equipment supporting military operations, training, briefings, and public affairs. You operated professional video cameras and recorded footage, configured and operated audio systems and mixing consoles, set up and operated projection systems and large displays, provided technical support for video teleconferences and presentations, troubleshot AV equipment failures during live events, maintained and repaired visual information equipment, edited video and audio, set up lighting systems, managed cables and signal distribution, and documented equipment configurations and problems. Your work required understanding video signal formats, audio principles, equipment connectivity, proper setup procedures, and troubleshooting methodology.

Unlike civilian AV technicians who work with commercial support and backup equipment, you often provided AV support in challenging environments—tactical locations, remote sites, and high-pressure briefings where equipment failure wasn't an option and you were the only technical expert. You diagnosed problems quickly, improvised solutions with limited resources, and delivered reliable technical support for mission-critical communications.
