## Bottom Line Up Front

Special Forces Communications Sergeants transitioning out—you're the technical expert who kept your team connected across denied communications environments. Your **advanced communications systems expertise, satellite and radio operations, network engineering skills, cybersecurity knowledge, encryption and COMSEC proficiency, security clearance, and proven ability to establish communications in impossible conditions** make you one of the most valuable tech professionals in the civilian market. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$85,000-$120,000** in IT or network engineering roles, scaling to **$130,000-$180,000+** in cybersecurity, cloud engineering, or defense contracting positions. Senior 18Es in cybersecurity leadership or specialized cleared roles can earn **$150,000-$250,000+**. You have technical skills and clearances that command premium pay—leverage them strategically.

You didn't just "use radios." You:
- Maintained proficiency across 20+ communications systems (tactical radios, satcom, HF/VHF/UHF)
- Established secure communications networks in denied and contested environments
- Managed encryption systems, COMSEC protocols, and classified communications
- Troubleshot and repaired complex communications equipment in austere conditions
- Designed and implemented tactical communications architectures
- Integrated communications across joint and coalition forces
- Held Top Secret/SCI clearance with extensive COMSEC access
- Trained partner forces on communications systems and network operations
- Operated in cyber and electromagnetic spectrum environments

That's technical systems mastery, network engineering, cybersecurity fundamentals, troubleshooting under pressure, and classified systems expertise. The civilian tech world needs that—you just need to translate military communications skills into civilian IT language and obtain industry certifications.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 18E separating hears: "Your military communications experience doesn't transfer to civilian IT," and "You'll need to start over in tech."

Both are false. Here's reality: **Your 18E communications and networking experience translates directly to high-demand, high-paying civilian IT careers—cybersecurity, network engineering, cloud infrastructure, and telecommunications. You just need civilian certifications to prove your knowledge and market yourself correctly.**

**Best for:** 18Es who prefer leadership and strategy over hands-on technical work, and want to leverage SF leadership in corporate IT environments.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "18E Communications Sergeant" and assuming civilians understand. Translate it:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Special Forces Communications Sergeant (18E) | Communications systems engineer with 8+ years managing tactical networks and secure communications |
| Tactical communications systems | Designed and implemented secure networks across 20+ communications platforms in high-threat environments |
| COMSEC and encryption | Managed encryption systems, cryptographic key management, and classified communications security protocols |
| Satellite communications (SATCOM) | Operated and maintained SATCOM systems including military and commercial satellite networks |
| Network troubleshooting | Diagnosed and resolved complex network and communications issues under time-critical conditions |
| RF spectrum management | Managed radio frequency spectrum allocation, interference mitigation, and wireless network optimization |
| Top Secret/SCI clearance | Active TS/SCI clearance with extensive COMSEC and classified systems access |
| Joint and coalition communications | Integrated communications across US military branches, CIA, and allied military communications networks |
| Training and instruction | Trained 100+ partner force communications personnel on tactical systems and network operations |
| Communications planning | Designed communications architectures supporting 50+ operations with zero communications failures |

Use **quantifiable results**: "Managed tactical networks supporting 200+ personnel across 15 countries with 99.9% uptime," "Integrated communications across 10+ coalition forces," "Trained 100+ personnel with zero security incidents."

Drop military jargon. Don't write "RETRANS," "COP," or "PACE plan" without context. Write "communications relay operations," "command observation post networking," and "primary/alternate/contingency communications planning."

## Certifications that actually matter

### High priority (get these ASAP):

**Security+ (CompTIA)** - DoD baseline certification, opens 90% of cleared IT jobs. Cost: $400 exam (FREE via DoD SkillBridge, Fortinet Veteran Program, or Cisco Veteran Program). Time: 2-4 weeks study. Value: Required for most cleared IT positions.

**CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)** - Gold standard for cybersecurity, massive salary boost. Cost: $749 exam (use GI Bill for $2,000-$3,000 training courses). Time: 3-6 months study. Value: $20K-$40K+ salary increase.

**CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** - Industry standard for network engineering. Cost: $300 exam (FREE training via Cisco Veteran Cyber Scholarship). Time: 3-6 months study. Value: Opens $85K-$120K network engineering roles.

**Maintain your security clearance** - Find cleared job within 2 years or it lapses. Cost: $0 if kept active. Value: Worth $30K-$50K+ in salary for cleared IT roles.

### Medium priority (career accelerators):

**AWS Certified Solutions Architect** - Critical for cloud careers. Cost: $150 exam + $50-$300 training. Time: 2-4 months. Value: Opens $95K-$180K cloud engineering roles.

**CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** or **CySA+** - Offensive/defensive cyber skills. Cost: $500-$1,200. Time: 3-6 months. Value: Differentiates you in cybersecurity market.

**PMP (Project Management Professional)** - If targeting IT management or program management. Cost: $500-$3,000. Time: 3-6 months. Value: Opens $110K-$180K PM roles.

**CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional)** - Advanced networking. Cost: $400-$900. Time: 6-12 months. Value: Opens senior network engineer roles ($110K-$180K+).

### Low priority (nice to have):

**Cloud Practitioner (AWS)** - Entry-level cloud cert. Cost: $100. Value: Good starting point before Solutions Architect.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be honest. There are civilian IT skills you need:

**Enterprise IT systems:** Military tactical comms are different from corporate IT. You need to learn Active Directory, enterprise networks, cloud platforms, virtualization, and corporate IT infrastructure.

**IT service management:** Civilian IT follows ITIL frameworks, change management processes, and service desk operations. Very different from tactical communications.

**Scripting and automation:** Modern IT requires scripting (Python, PowerShell, Bash). You'll need basic coding skills for automation and DevOps.

**Civilian certifications:** Your military training is valuable but you MUST get civilian certifications (Security+, CISSP, CCNA) to prove your knowledge and get hired.

**Corporate communication:** Translate technical issues for non-technical stakeholders. IT requires soft skills and customer service.

**Patience with bureaucracy:** Corporate IT moves slowly. Change management, approvals, testing environments—everything takes longer than tactical operations.

**Networking:** IT careers are relationship-driven. Join veteran IT communities, connect on LinkedIn, attend security conferences (DefCon, Black Hat, RSA). Many cleared IT jobs aren't posted publicly.
