## Bottom Line Up Front

Marines with Air Support Operations Operator experience bring **close air support coordination, aviation/ground integration, tactical communications, real-time mission planning, CASEVAC/MEDEVAC coordination, and crisis decision-making**—skills that translate directly to defense contractor tactical coordination, aviation operations, emergency medical aviation, tactical operations centers, and crisis management. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$70,000-$95,000**, with experienced professionals in defense contracting and specialized aviation coordination hitting **$110,000-$165,000+**. Your unique combination of aviation knowledge and ground tactical coordination makes you highly valuable to defense contractors, aviation operations, and emergency services.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every Air Support Operations Operator transitioning out hears: "That's very specific to military operations." "No civilian equivalent exists." "You'll need to completely retrain."

That's incorrect. Here's what they're missing: **You're not just an "air support operator"—you're a tactical aviation coordinator with specialized expertise in life-or-death coordination.**

You didn't just "call in air strikes." You:
- Coordinated complex close air support operations integrating aircraft with ground maneuver
- Directed CASEVAC and MEDEVAC missions under fire, making life-or-death timing decisions
- Managed tactical airspace deconfliction with multiple aircraft and fires
- Communicated with pilots, ground commanders, and fires coordinators simultaneously
- Planned and executed assault support missions (helicopter troop/cargo movement)
- Maintained real-time situational awareness of air and ground battlespace
- Troubleshot communications and coordination challenges under extreme pressure
- Briefed and debriefed complex aviation operations
- Executed tactical decision-making with immediate consequences
- Trained ground units on aviation integration procedures

That's aviation operations expertise, tactical coordination, crisis management, communications integration, and precision execution under pressure. Defense contractors, aviation operations, emergency medical services, and tactical operations centers need exactly these skills. You just need to translate them into civilian contexts.

## Best civilian career paths for Air Support Operations Operators

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Honest assessment helps you close gaps faster:

**Civilian aviation terminology and regulations** - If pursuing FAA dispatcher or aviation operations, learn civilian aviation (different from military aviation operations). FAA regulations, civilian procedures, airline operations concepts. Dispatcher training covers this.

**Translating combat operations for civilian audiences** - Your CAS and CASEVAC experience is combat-focused. Translate to civilian terms: "coordinated time-critical aviation operations" not "directed danger-close CAS." Focus on coordination, communications, crisis management—not weapons.

**Medical terminology** - If pursuing medical aviation, learn basic medical terms (types of emergencies, medical equipment, hospital procedures). EMT certification builds this foundation.

**Customer service communication** - Military communication is direct and brief. Civilian coordination roles (airline operations, 911 dispatch) require calmer, more empathetic communication style. Practice adjusting communication for stressed civilian callers or passengers.

**Corporate culture** - If pursuing corporate roles, understand corporate environment is different from military. More consensus-building, less direct hierarchy. Practice influencing without authority and stakeholder management.

**Networking** - Military gives you orders. Civilian world requires networking. Connect with veterans in your target field on LinkedIn. Attend veteran hiring events. Join professional organizations (Air Medical Operators Association, APCO for dispatch, IAEM for emergency mgmt). Many jobs filled through referrals.
