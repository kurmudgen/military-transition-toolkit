### Slide 2: The Veteran Hiring Paradox

**Headline:** "Companies Want to Hire Veterans. Veterans Leave Quickly. Why?"

**Content:**

**The Opportunity:**
- **200,000** service members transition annually - massive talent pool
- Veterans bring leadership, discipline, adaptability, crisis management
- **87%** of consumers prefer businesses that support veterans
- Corporate veteran hiring programs expanding across industries
- VEVRAA compliance requirement: **5.2%** hiring benchmark for federal contractors

**The Problem:**
- **43%** of veterans leave their first civilian job within ONE YEAR
- **80%** leave before the end of their SECOND year
- **60%+** of veterans are underemployed relative to their skills
- **Only 15%** felt military transition programs adequately prepared them

**The Cost:**
- Average cost to replace employee: **$4,129**
- For specialized roles: **$15,000-$50,000+**
- Lost productivity, training investment, recruiting costs
- Damage to employer brand and veteran hiring reputation

**The Reality:**
> "I was recruited aggressively as a veteran. The company talked about valuing my military skills. But once I started, I felt lost. Nobody understood my background. I had no clear career path. I left after 11 months."
> — Former E-6, Now in Second Civilian Role

**Visual:**

**Presenter Notes:**
"Let's talk about the veteran hiring paradox.

On one hand, companies want to hire veterans. Two hundred thousand transition annually—enormous talent pool. Veterans bring incredible skills: leadership, discipline, adaptability, crisis management. Eighty-seven percent of consumers prefer businesses supporting veterans. And if you're a federal contractor, you have a 5.2% VEVRAA hiring benchmark.

But here's the problem: 43% of veterans leave their first civilian job within one year. Eighty percent leave before year two. Over 60% are underemployed relative to their skills. Only 15% felt adequately prepared for civilian employment by military transition programs.

The cost is significant. Average replacement cost is over $4,000 per employee. For specialized roles, $15,000 to $50,000 or more. That doesn't count lost productivity, wasted training investment, and recruiting costs. Plus damage to your employer brand.

Listen to this veteran. [Read quote]

This is the reality for many veteran hires. Companies recruit aggressively, talk about valuing military skills, but once veterans start, they feel lost. No clear career path. Management doesn't understand their background. They leave within a year.

This isn't a veteran problem. It's a support gap problem. And it's costing companies millions while hurting veterans and damaging CSR initiatives."

### Slide 3: Why Veterans Leave (Root Causes)

**Headline:** "Understanding the Real Reasons Behind Veteran Turnover"

**Content:**

**Reason 1: Career Path Uncertainty**
- Veterans used to clear rank progression and career paths
- Civilian organizations have ambiguous advancement structures
- No clear understanding of how to grow in the organization
- **Impact:** 38% cite "lack of opportunity for advancement" as reason for leaving

**Reason 2: Cultural Disconnect**
- Military culture vastly different from corporate culture
- Veterans struggle to translate military accomplishments to civilian context
- Feel misunderstood by managers and colleagues
- **Impact:** 44% report difficulty adjusting to civilian workplace culture

**Reason 3: Skills Translation Gap**
- Veterans don't know how to articulate military experience in corporate terms
- Hiring managers recruited veterans but don't understand their full capabilities
- Military skills underutilized in current role
- **Impact:** 60%+ underemployment rate among veterans

**Reason 4: Inadequate Onboarding**
- Generic onboarding doesn't address veteran-specific needs
- No mentor or guide who understands military background
- Overwhelming number of new concepts without military context
- **Impact:** 86% of new hires decide how long to stay within first 6 months

**Reason 5: Compensation Misalignment**
- Veterans often accept first offer without understanding market value
- Don't negotiate effectively due to inexperience
- Realize later they're underpaid relative to peers
- **Impact:** Compensation dissatisfaction drives job search

**Reason 6: Job Mismatch**
- Took job to meet immediate need, not long-term fit
- Role doesn't align with military skills and interests
- Better opportunity found after learning civilian landscape
- **Impact:** "I took the first job offer. I didn't know what else was out there."

**The Through-Line:**
All these reasons share a common cause: **Inadequate transition support and ongoing career development**

Veterans need more than a job offer. They need:
- Clear understanding of civilian career paths
- Help translating military experience to corporate advancement
- Ongoing career development support during first 1-2 years
- Managers who understand how to leverage military backgrounds

**Visual:**
Six reasons displayed with icons and impact statistics; through-line highlighted at bottom

**Presenter Notes:**
"Let's understand why veterans actually leave, because solving this requires addressing root causes.

Reason one: career path uncertainty. Veterans are used to clear rank progression. In the military, you know exactly what's required to advance. Civilian organizations have ambiguous structures. Veterans don't understand how to grow. Thirty-eight percent cite lack of advancement opportunity.

Reason two: cultural disconnect. Military culture is vastly different from corporate culture. Veterans struggle to translate military accomplishments to civilian context. They feel misunderstood by managers and colleagues. Forty-four percent report difficulty adjusting to civilian workplace culture.

Reason three: skills translation gap. Veterans don't know how to articulate military experience in corporate terms. You recruited them, but do your hiring managers fully understand their capabilities? Military skills are often underutilized. This drives 60%+ underemployment.

Reason four: inadequate onboarding. Generic onboarding doesn't address veteran-specific needs. No mentor who understands military backgrounds. Overwhelming new concepts without context. Eighty-six percent of new hires decide how long they'll stay within six months—before you realize there's a problem.

Reason five: compensation misalignment. Veterans often accept the first offer without understanding market value. They don't negotiate effectively due to inexperience with civilian compensation. Later, they realize they're underpaid, and that drives job searching.

Reason six: job mismatch. Many veterans take the first job to meet immediate needs. After learning the civilian landscape, they find better-aligned opportunities.

Here's the through-line: all these reasons share a common cause—inadequate transition support and ongoing career development.

Veterans need more than a job offer. They need clear understanding of civilian career paths, help translating military experience to corporate advancement, ongoing support during first one to two years, and managers who understand how to leverage military backgrounds.

That's what we solve."

**Presenter Notes:**
"Here's our solution: Military Transition Toolkit as employee benefit for your veteran hires.

This is a comprehensive digital career development platform you provide to veterans as part of your hiring package and ongoing employment.

Here's how it works across three phases.

Pre-hire, optionally, candidates can access the platform while preparing for interviews. They learn how to understand corporate career expectations and translate military experience for civilian context. This actually makes them better candidates in your interviews.

Phase two is new hire onboarding, which is critical. The veteran receives access as part of their welcome package. They get orientation to civilian workplace concepts in military-friendly language. They build career path plans within your organization and create skill development roadmaps aligned with their role and advancement potential.

Phase three is ongoing development, which is your retention driver. Continuous access for the first two years provides career progression guidance, skills translation for performance reviews, professional development planning, and long-term career strategy.

Key features in corporate context:

Career development planning helps veterans understand corporate career paths versus military rank structures. How to advance through performance reviews, promotions, lateral moves. How to build professional networks in civilian context.

Skills translation helps veterans articulate military leadership in performance reviews, translate accomplishments to corporate KPIs, and leverage military skills for project leadership.

Professional development resources focus on certifications valued in your industry, education benefits utilization, technical skills development, and soft skills for corporate environment.

Compensation and negotiation guidance helps veterans understand civilian compensation structures, negotiate raises, research market rates, and optimize benefits.

Cultural integration support addresses civilian workplace norms, communication style differences, building relationships with non-veteran colleagues, and navigating ambiguity.

State benefits information helps relocating veterans access state-specific programs and local resources.

What makes this different from generic employee development? It's built specifically for military-to-civilian transition, speaks military language, addresses unique veteran challenges, available 24/7 beyond HR hours, complements your internal programs, and it's cost-effective compared to dedicated program staff.

This is how you go from hiring veterans to retaining and developing them."

**Visual:**
Six benefit categories with icons and ROI calculations; summary ROI example in highlighted box

**Presenter Notes:**
"Let's talk about return on investment across six dimensions.

First, dramatically improved veteran retention. We reduce first-year turnover from 43% to under 25%, and two-year turnover from 80% to under 40%. Veterans stay longer, contribute more, advance further.

Here's the ROI. For every 100 veteran hires, without this platform, 43 leave in the first year, costing you $177,000 in replacement costs. With the platform, 25 leave, costing $103,000. That's $74,000 in savings per 100 veteran hires. For specialized roles, savings multiply to $750,000 or more.

Second, enhanced employer brand. You differentiate by saying 'We don't just hire veterans, we support their long-term success.' You get word-of-mouth recruiting, awards recognition, press opportunities. This makes recruiting easier, attracts higher quality candidates, reduces recruiting costs through referrals, and enhances your consumer brand.

Third, improved VEVRAA compliance if you're a federal contractor. You demonstrate good-faith efforts beyond basic compliance, retain veterans which counts toward continuous improvement, document your veteran support programs, and respond positively to OFCCP audits. This reduces compliance risk and creates competitive advantage for government contracts.

Fourth, better utilization of veteran talent. Veterans better understand how to apply military skills. Managers better leverage their capabilities. Military skills are utilized for high-impact projects. Veterans advance to leadership faster. This means higher productivity, better ROI on recruiting investment, and improved diversity in leadership pipeline.

Fifth, stronger CSR. This is tangible veteran support beyond hiring with measurable outcomes for ESG reporting. It's authentic commitment that enhances corporate reputation, satisfies investors and stakeholders, builds employee pride, and drives customer loyalty.

Sixth, reduced HR and manager burden. The platform provides 24/7 support. Managers spend less time on basic questions. Your veteran program scales without adding staff. Self-service resources reduce help desk volume.

Here's a summary ROI example. Mid-size employer hiring 100 veterans annually invests $15,000 per year in the platform. Retention improvement prevents 18 first-year departures, saving $74,000. Net ROI is $59,000—a 393% return. And that doesn't count enhanced brand, improved compliance, better talent utilization, stronger CSR, and operational efficiencies.

This is one of the highest ROI employee benefits you can provide."
