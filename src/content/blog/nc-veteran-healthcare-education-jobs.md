# North Carolina Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

North Carolina operates four full VA medical centers (Durham, Asheville, Fayetteville/Coastal, Salisbury) plus over 30 community-based outpatient clinics statewide, providing excellent geographic coverage. Durham VAMC serves 200,000+ veterans across central and eastern NC, while Fayetteville Coastal serves the massive Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) population. About 90% of NC veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care—among the best access nationally for a large state.

For education, the University of North Carolina system participates in Yellow Ribbon programs with varying amounts, NC State awarded $71,000+ in Yellow Ribbon benefits, and all NC community colleges are GI Bill-approved with tuition around $6,960-$7,200 annually (fully covered by GI Bill). North Carolina's community college system is the third largest nationally—58 colleges offering trade programs perfectly suited for transitioning veterans. Veterans get in-state tuition without residency requirements if discharged within 3 years.

Employment is solid, with North Carolina's veteran unemployment at 2.6% (2024)—lower than the national veteran average of 3.0%. The state has the 5th largest military presence nationally with Fort Liberty, Camp Lejeune, Seymour Johnson AFB, and Coast Guard stations. Major employers like Bank of America (6,800+ veterans employed), Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, and the Research Triangle Park tech corridor actively recruit veterans. The 2025 state hiring preference gives veterans precedence in government jobs.

Overall rating: **8.5/10** for healthcare (four medical centers plus extensive clinic network), **8.5/10** for education (strong GI Bill schools, large community college system, Yellow Ribbon participation), **8/10** for employment (good veteran unemployment rate, strong military-friendly employers, new state hiring preference).

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- 90% of NC veterans live within 60 minutes of VA primary care
- Urban access (Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, Fayetteville, Asheville): Excellent—direct access to medical centers or CBOCs within 20-40 minutes
- Rural access: Good—extensive CBOC network covers most rural areas; mountainous western counties (Graham, Clay, Cherokee) may require 60-90 minute drives for primary care

**Quality Ratings:**
- Durham VAMC: Average to above-average (3-4 stars)
- Fayetteville Coastal: Average (3 stars)—improving with recent facility investments
- Salisbury VAMC: Average (3 stars)—strong geriatric and psychiatric programs
- Asheville VAMC: Above-average (3-4 stars)—highly rated for rural access and mental health

**Wait Times (Average across NC VAMCs):**
- Primary care: 15-25 days (meets VA's 20-day standard)
- Mental health: 15-30 days (varies by facility—Fayetteville runs longer due to Fort Liberty demand)
- Specialty care: 30-50 days (cardiology, orthopedics, neurology average 35-45 days)

**Strengths:** North Carolina's four-medical-center model with 30+ CBOCs provides exceptional geographic coverage for a large state. Veterans in every region have reasonable access to care.

**Areas for improvement:** Specialty care wait times can extend beyond 30 days, particularly at Fayetteville (high demand from Fort Liberty community). Rural mountain counties in western NC require longer travel for specialty services.
