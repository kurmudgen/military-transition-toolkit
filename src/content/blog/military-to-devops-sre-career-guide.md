# Military to DevOps/SRE: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) offer exceptional salaries for veterans, with entry-level positions starting at $90,000 and senior engineers earning $180,000-$280,000+. These roles combine systems administration, automation, and software development—areas where military technical training provides strong foundations. Your experience with mission-critical systems, on-call operations, and maintaining high availability directly translates. The field has massive demand and relatively limited supply, creating excellent job security. Most veterans can transition within 6-9 months by combining cloud certifications with scripting and automation skills.

## Why Veterans Excel in DevOps/SRE

DevOps and SRE roles are fundamentally about keeping systems running reliably while enabling rapid change—exactly what military communications and IT specialists do. You've maintained mission-critical systems where downtime has real consequences, not just business impact. This operational mindset is core to SRE philosophy.

The military's emphasis on procedures, runbooks, and documentation aligns perfectly with infrastructure as code and automation practices. You understand why standardized processes matter and how to create and follow them under pressure.

On-call rotations and incident response are familiar territory. While many civilians struggle with 24/7 operations tempo, you've stood watch, responded to emergencies at all hours, and understand alert fatigue. This experience is invaluable in SRE environments.

Your troubleshooting methodology—systematic, thorough, persistent—applies directly to debugging complex distributed systems. The military trained you to isolate problems, document findings, and implement permanent fixes, not just quick patches.

Security awareness ingrained by military training supports DevSecOps practices, where security is integrated throughout the development and operations lifecycle. Your understanding of access control, audit trails, and operational security translates directly.

Security clearances open doors to defense contractor DevOps positions where cleared engineers maintain critical infrastructure for government customers. These roles pay substantial premiums and have less competition.

## Day in the Life: What to Expect

**DevOps Engineer**

Morning (8:00-12:00)
- Review overnight alerts and deployment status
- Team standup meeting
- Work on automation projects (CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code)
- Code review for infrastructure changes
- Collaborate with development teams on deployment requirements

Afternoon (1:00-5:00)
- Implement infrastructure changes
- Debug deployment or environment issues
- Documentation updates
- Planning for upcoming releases
- On-call handoff if rotating

**Site Reliability Engineer**

- Monitor service level objectives (SLOs) and error budgets
- Conduct post-incident reviews (PIRs) after outages
- Build automation to reduce toil (manual, repetitive work)
- Participate in on-call rotation (typically 1 week per month)
- Work with development teams on reliability improvements
- Design and implement monitoring and alerting
- Capacity planning and performance optimization

**On-Call Responsibilities**
- Respond to alerts within SLA (often 15-30 minutes)
- Triage and resolve incidents
- Escalate when necessary
- Document incident timeline and resolution
- Participate in post-incident reviews

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. All Ops, No Dev**
DevOps requires both operations and development skills. Don't neglect programming—learn Python or Go for automation.

**2. Ignoring Fundamentals**
Understand Linux internals, networking, and distributed systems concepts. Certifications alone won't substitute for deep understanding.

**3. Tool Chasing**
The ecosystem changes rapidly, but fundamentals remain constant. Focus on concepts (CI/CD, infrastructure as code, observability) rather than specific tools.

**4. Skipping Kubernetes**
Container orchestration is essential for modern DevOps/SRE. Kubernetes is the industry standard—learn it thoroughly.

**5. Not Building a Home Lab**
Hands-on experience matters more than certifications. Build, break, and fix systems in a home lab environment.

**6. Underestimating Soft Skills**
DevOps is about culture and collaboration as much as technology. Communication and cross-team collaboration skills are essential.

**7. Avoiding On-Call**
On-call experience is expected and valued. Don't shy away from positions with on-call requirements—it's where you learn the most.
