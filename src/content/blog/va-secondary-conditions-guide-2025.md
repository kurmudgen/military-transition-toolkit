## Bottom Line Up Front

**Secondary conditions are how you increase your VA rating.** If you're rated for a primary service-connected condition (like PTSD, back injury, or tinnitus), you can claim additional conditions that were **caused or aggravated by** that primary condition. Example: PTSD (primary) can lead to sleep apnea, IBS, or migraines (secondary). **Each secondary condition adds to your overall rating**, potentially pushing you from 50% to 70%, or 70% to 100%. The key is **medical nexus**—proving the connection between your primary and secondary conditions with medical evidence or a doctor's opinion. Most veterans leave money on the table by not filing for secondary conditions.

## What are secondary conditions?

Here's the deal: You get injured in service. Back pain from jumping out of aircraft. PTSD from deployment. Tinnitus from weapons fire.

That's your **primary service-connected condition**. The VA rates it at 10%, 30%, 50%, whatever.

But here's what a lot of veterans don't realize: **that primary condition causes other problems**.

Your back pain? It leads to knee and hip issues because you're compensating when you walk. Your PTSD? It causes sleep apnea, IBS, depression. Your tinnitus? It contributes to migraines and sleep disturbance.

Those new problems are **secondary conditions**. And **you can claim them for additional VA disability rating**.

## Why secondary conditions matter (the money)

Let's do the math.

Say you're rated:
- **50% for PTSD** - $1,075.16/month

You file secondary claims for:
- **Sleep apnea (caused by PTSD)** - rated 50%
- **IBS (caused by PTSD)** - rated 30%

Your new combined rating: **80%** - $1,995.01/month

That's an increase of **$919.85/month** or **$11,038.20/year**.

Over 20 years? **$220,764** in additional disability compensation.

And if those secondary conditions push you to **100%**? That's **$3,737.85/month** or **$44,854.20/year**. Plus access to additional benefits like ChampVA for dependents, property tax exemptions in some states, and more.

Secondary conditions aren't a loophole. They're part of the VA disability system. Use them.

## Common secondary condition pathways

Let's break down the most common primary conditions and their typical secondary claims.

### PTSD (Primary) → Secondary Conditions

PTSD is a goldmine for secondary claims because it affects your entire body—mental, physical, digestive, sleep, everything.

**Common secondary conditions to PTSD:**

**Sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea / OSA)**
- **Nexus:** PTSD causes hypervigilance, nightmares, and disrupted sleep patterns, leading to or worsening sleep apnea.

- **What you need:** Sleep study showing OSA diagnosis, medical opinion linking PTSD to sleep apnea.

**Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**
- **Nexus:** PTSD increases stress hormones, which directly affect gut function (the gut-brain connection is well-documented).
- **Rating potential:** 10%, 30%
- **What you need:** Diagnosis of IBS from a doctor, medical opinion linking PTSD to IBS.

**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**
- **Nexus:** PTSD-related stress and anxiety increase stomach acid production.
- **Rating potential:** 10%, 30%, 60%

## How to establish medical nexus

Here's the key to getting a secondary condition approved: **medical nexus**.

**Medical nexus** = proof that your secondary condition is "at least as likely as not" (50% or more probability) caused or aggravated by your primary service-connected condition.

The VA needs to see a **clear connection**. You can't just say "I have PTSD and IBS." You need to show **why** your PTSD caused your IBS.

### Three ways to establish nexus:

**1. Medical research / literature**

Some connections are so well-established that medical literature supports them.

Example: **PTSD and IBS**. There are dozens of peer-reviewed studies showing the gut-brain connection and how stress/PTSD worsens IBS.

When you file your claim, you can attach research articles showing the connection.

**2. Doctor's opinion / nexus letter**

The strongest evidence is a **nexus letter** from a doctor (your VA doctor, private doctor, or an independent medical examiner).

A nexus letter states:

> "It is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that the veteran's IBS is caused or aggravated by their service-connected PTSD."

The doctor explains the medical reasoning, cites your treatment history, and provides their professional opinion.

**How to get a nexus letter:**
- Ask your VA doctor (some will write them, some won't).
- Pay a private doctor (costs $500-$2,000 depending on complexity).
- Use a veteran-focused medical examination company (like Nexus Letters, Veteran Advocate Services, etc.).

**What makes a strong nexus letter:**
- Doctor's credentials (MD, DO, licensed specialist in relevant field)
- Review of your medical records
- Clear statement of probability ("at least as likely as not")
- Explanation of medical reasoning
- Signature and date

**3. Lay evidence (your own statement)**

You can submit a **personal statement** describing how your primary condition causes your secondary condition.

Example:

> "My PTSD causes severe nightmares and hypervigilance, which prevent me from sleeping. I wake up multiple times per night in a panic. My wife says I stop breathing in my sleep. I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in 2022 and now use a CPAP machine. My sleep apnea did not exist before my PTSD symptoms started."

Lay evidence isn't as strong as medical evidence, but it supports your claim.

## How to file a secondary condition claim

Filing a secondary claim is almost identical to filing a primary claim, with one key difference: **you must specify which service-connected condition is causing the secondary condition**.

### Step-by-step process:

**Step 1: Gather evidence**

Before you file, collect:
- **Your VA rating decision letters** (showing your primary service-connected conditions)
- **Medical records** documenting your secondary condition (diagnosis, treatment, tests)
- **Nexus letter** (if you have one)
- **Lay statements** (your description of how the conditions are connected)
- **Medical research** (if applicable)

**Step 2: File your claim**

Go to **VA.gov** or **eBenefits** and file a claim for "increase" or "new condition."

When asked if the condition is secondary to another service-connected condition, select **YES** and specify which primary condition is causing it.

Example:
- **Condition you're claiming:** Sleep apnea
- **Is this secondary to a service-connected condition?** Yes
- **Which condition?** PTSD

**Step 3: Attend C&P exam (if scheduled)**

The VA will likely schedule a **Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam** to evaluate your secondary condition.

**During the C&P exam:**
- Explain how your primary condition causes the secondary condition.
- Describe your symptoms in detail (be honest, don't downplay).
- Mention any medical treatment, medications, or lifestyle impacts.

**Common mistake:** Not explaining the connection. The C&P examiner might not ask directly, so volunteer the information. "My sleep apnea is caused by my PTSD. I have nightmares and can't sleep, and my doctor says that contributed to my OSA."

**Step 4: Wait for the decision**

The VA will review your evidence and C&P exam results. Average wait time: **3-6 months** (sometimes longer).

**Step 5: Appeal if denied**

If your secondary claim is denied, you can appeal. Common reasons for denial:
- Insufficient medical nexus (fix this by getting a nexus letter)
- Examiner's opinion contradicts your claim (get a private medical opinion and file a supplemental claim)

## Success rates for secondary claims

Here's the reality: **secondary claims have lower approval rates than primary claims** because they require stronger evidence (you need to prove the connection, not just that you have the condition).

**Approximate approval rates:**
- **Well-documented secondary claims (with nexus letter):** 60-80%
- **Secondary claims with weak evidence (no nexus letter):** 20-40%

**The takeaway:** Don't file a secondary claim without evidence. Get a nexus letter. Do it right the first time.

## Common mistakes to avoid

### Mistake #1: Not claiming secondary conditions at all

Most veterans don't even know secondary claims exist. You're leaving money on the table.

If you've been rated for a condition for 5+ years and never filed for secondary conditions, you're probably missing something.

### Mistake #2: Filing without medical evidence

Just because you have PTSD and IBS doesn't mean the VA will connect them. You need **nexus**.

Get a doctor's opinion. Don't rely on the C&P examiner to make the connection for you.

### Mistake #3: Waiting too long

You can file secondary claims anytime, but the sooner you file, the sooner you get paid.

If your primary condition has caused a secondary condition, file now. Don't wait.

### Mistake #4: Not preparing for the C&P exam

The C&P examiner's report carries huge weight. If you don't explain the connection during the exam, the examiner might not note it.

**Prep for the exam:**
- Write down your symptoms and how they're connected to your primary condition.
- Bring a copy of your nexus letter (if you have one).
- Be clear and detailed.

### Mistake #5: Giving up after a denial

Denials happen. Appeal. Get more evidence. File a supplemental claim with a nexus letter.

Many veterans win their secondary claims on appeal.

## Real examples of successful secondary claims

**Case 1: PTSD → Sleep apnea**

Veteran rated 70% for PTSD. Filed secondary claim for sleep apnea, arguing PTSD-related nightmares and hypervigilance disrupted sleep and contributed to OSA. Submitted nexus letter from private doctor. Sleep study showed moderate OSA requiring CPAP. VA approved at 50%. New combined rating: 90%. Monthly increase: $800+.

**Case 2: Back injury → Knee pain**

Veteran rated 20% for lumbar spine condition. Filed secondary claims for both knees, arguing altered gait from back pain caused knee strain. Submitted X-rays showing knee degeneration, nexus letter from orthopedic specialist. VA approved 10% per knee. New combined rating: 40%. Monthly increase: $300+.

**Case 3: Tinnitus → Migraines**

Veteran rated 10% for tinnitus. Filed secondary claim for migraines, arguing constant ringing triggered headaches. Submitted migraine diary and nexus letter from neurologist. VA approved at 30% for migraines. New combined rating: 40%. Monthly increase: $600+.

## How to research your own secondary conditions

Not sure what secondary conditions you might qualify for? Here's how to research:

**Step 1: List your primary service-connected conditions**

Pull out your VA rating decision letters. Write down every condition you're rated for.

**Step 2: Research common secondary conditions**

Google: "[primary condition] secondary VA conditions"

Example: "PTSD secondary VA conditions"

You'll find veteran forums, VSO guides, and articles listing common pathways.

**Step 3: Check your medical records**

Look through your VA and civilian medical records. Have you been diagnosed with anything that could be connected to your primary conditions?

Example: You're rated for PTSD. Your medical records show you've been treated for IBS, migraines, and insomnia. Those are all potential secondary claims.

**Step 4: Talk to your doctor**

Ask your VA doctor or primary care physician: "Could my [secondary condition] be related to my service-connected [primary condition]?"

They might say yes and write you a nexus letter on the spot.

**Step 5: Use our tool**

Use the [VA secondary conditions tracker at Military Transition Toolkit](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com) to explore common pathways and track your potential claims.

## Bottom line on secondary conditions

If you're rated for any VA disability, you probably qualify for secondary conditions.

**PTSD** → sleep apnea, IBS, GERD, migraines, depression
**Back pain** → knee/hip/ankle issues, sciatica, mental health
**Tinnitus** → migraines, insomnia, anxiety

Each secondary condition increases your rating. Each rating increase means more monthly compensation.

The key is **medical nexus**. Prove the connection with a doctor's opinion, medical records, or research.

Don't leave money on the table. File your secondary claims.
