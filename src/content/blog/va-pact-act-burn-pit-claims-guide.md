## How Presumptive Conditions Work

### Before PACT Act

To claim burn pit-related conditions, you needed:
1. Proof of exposure
2. Current diagnosis
3. Medical nexus opinion linking them

**Many claims were denied** because veterans couldn't prove exposure or nexus.

### After PACT Act

For presumptive conditions:
1. Proof of qualifying service (dates/location)
2. Current diagnosis of presumptive condition
3. **No nexus required** - connection is presumed

**Much easier to win claims.**

## How to File a PACT Act Claim

### Step 1: File Intent to File

Lock in your effective date. Do this immediately if you have qualifying conditions.

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

**Required:**
- DD-214 (showing deployment locations)
- Medical records (diagnosis of condition)

**Helpful:**
- Deployment orders
- Service records showing location
- Medical records documenting symptoms/treatment

### Step 3: File Your Claim

**VA Form 21-526EZ:**
- List your condition(s)
- Indicate service location and dates
- Note "PACT Act presumptive" if applicable

**Online:** va.gov
**In person:** VA regional office
**With VSO:** Recommended for complex claims

### Step 4: C&P Exam

VA will schedule a Compensation & Pension exam to:
- Confirm your diagnosis
- Assess severity for rating

### Step 5: Rating Decision

VA issues decision. For presumptives, if you have:
- Qualifying service
- Confirmed diagnosis

**Service connection should be granted.**

## Toxic Exposure Screening

### Free VA Healthcare Screening

All veterans can now receive toxic exposure screening at VA healthcare:
- Review of service history
- Physical examination
- Documentation in medical record

### Why Get Screened

1. Documents your exposure history
2. Establishes VA care relationship
3. Helps identify conditions early
4. Supports future claims

## Healthcare Eligibility Expansion

### New Enrollment Periods

The PACT Act expands VA healthcare eligibility:

**Post-9/11 Veterans:**
- 10 years of eligibility after discharge (expanded from 5)
- Covers toxic exposure health effects

**Vietnam Veterans:**
- Enhanced enrollment priority
- Additional presumptive conditions

**All Veterans with Toxic Exposure:**
- Improved access to healthcare
- No copay requirements for certain conditions

### Priority Groups

The PACT Act enhanced priority group status for toxic exposure veterans, improving access to VA healthcare.

## Claiming Multiple Conditions

### Strategy

If you served in covered locations, consider claiming:
- All respiratory conditions you have
- Related secondary conditions
- Conditions that may be connected

### Example Claims Package

**Veteran who deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan:**

Primary claims (PACT Act presumptive):
- Asthma
- Chronic sinusitis
- Chronic rhinitis

Secondary claims:
- Sleep apnea (secondary to sinusitis)
- Migraines (secondary to sinusitis)
- GERD (secondary to medications)

### Combined Rating Impact

Multiple conditions combine for higher overall rating:
- Asthma: 30%
- Sinusitis: 30%
- Rhinitis: 10%
- **Combined: 50%+** (with secondaries, potentially higher)

## Special Considerations

### Previously Denied Claims

If you were previously denied for conditions now presumptive:
1. File a Supplemental Claim
2. New evidence: PACT Act presumption
3. VA should reconsider under new law

### Surviving Family Members

The PACT Act also benefits survivors:
- Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)
- Improved benefits for qualifying deaths
- New presumptive conditions for survivor claims

### Effective Dates

For most PACT Act conditions:
- Effective date is the date you file
- File Intent to File immediately to protect your date
- Some conditions have special effective date rules

## Common Questions

### Do I need proof of burn pit exposure?

**For presumptive conditions:** No. If you served in covered locations during covered dates and have the diagnosis, exposure is presumed.

### What if my condition isn't on the presumptive list?

You can still file. You'll need to establish nexus through evidence, but the PACT Act's toxic exposure framework may help.

### Can I reopen an old claim?

Yes. If you were denied before and your condition is now presumptive, file a Supplemental Claim.

### How long does the process take?

PACT Act claims are prioritized but still take 3-6+ months typically.

### Do I need a lawyer?

Not required. A VSO can help for free. Complex cases may benefit from legal help.

## Tips for PACT Act Claims

### Document Your Service

- Ensure your DD-214 shows deployment locations
- Gather any orders or records showing where you served
- Document specific exposure incidents if possible

### Get Diagnosed

- See a doctor for your symptoms
- Get formal diagnoses in writing
- Use VA healthcare (supports your claim)

### File Early

- File Intent to File immediately
- Don't wait for "more evidence"
- Earlier filing = earlier effective date = more backpay

### Claim Everything

- List all conditions that might be related
- Include secondary conditions
- Let VA evaluate—they may grant more than expected

### Use a VSO

- Free assistance
- Knowledge of PACT Act
- Help with paperwork
