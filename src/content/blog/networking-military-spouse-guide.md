# Networking as a Military Spouse: Digital + Local Strategies

## Bottom Line Up Front

Networking is how **70-80% of jobs are found**—but military spouses face unique challenges building networks when relocations reset local connections every 2-3 years. The solution is a **dual strategy**: build a portable digital network that travels with you, while also making meaningful local connections at each duty station. This guide shows you how to network effectively despite frequent moves and turn your unique position into a networking advantage.

- Plan what to wear (slightly overdressed > underdressed)

### At the Event

**Effective Approach:**

- Look for people standing alone or in groups of 3+
- Ask questions and listen more than you talk
- Exchange contact information
- Don't spend all time with one person

**Conversation Starters:**
- "What brings you to this event?"
- "How did you get into [industry]?"

## Overcoming Networking Challenges

### "I'm Introverted"

**Strategies:**
- Focus on one-on-one conversations
- Arrive early when crowds are smaller
- Take breaks during events
- Use online networking (more comfortable for many introverts)
- Quality over quantity—deep relationships matter more

### "I Don't Know What to Say"

**Simple Framework:**
- Ask about them (people love talking about themselves)
- Find common ground
- Share briefly about yourself
- Ask follow-up questions
- Exchange contact info

### "I'm New and Don't Know Anyone"

**The Military Spouse Advantage:**
Being new gives you permission to introduce yourself and ask questions. Use it.

**Opening:**
"I just relocated here and am building my professional network. Mind if I introduce myself?"

### "I Don't Have Time"

**Efficient Networking:**
- 15 minutes daily on LinkedIn
- One event per month
- Virtual events (no commute)
- Combine networking with other activities
- Focus on quality over quantity

### "I Feel Like I Have Nothing to Offer"

**What You Actually Offer:**
- Your perspective and experience
- Connections in other locations
- Information about industries you've worked in
- Genuine interest in others
- Willingness to help

## Maintaining Your Network Through PCS

### Before You Leave

- Connect with everyone on LinkedIn

- Attend final local events

### After You Move

- Send update to network about new location
- Stay engaged on social media

### Turning Old Locations Into Assets

Your network spreads geographically with each PCS. This is valuable:
- Connections for job searches in multiple areas
- Information about different markets
- References from multiple locations
- Friends who can introduce you to their networks

## Measuring Networking Success

### Quality Over Quantity

**Good Metrics:**
- Number of meaningful conversations this month
- Relationships that have developed over time

- Business cards collected

### Building Relationships That Last
