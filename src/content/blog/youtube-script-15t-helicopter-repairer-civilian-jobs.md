- General aviation mechanic: $45,000-$60,000/year
- Regional airline mechanic: $50,000-$70,000/year
- Helicopter mechanic: $55,000-$75,000/year

**With FAA A&P license:**
- Entry A&P mechanic: $55,000-$75,000/year
- Experienced A&P (3-5 years): $70,000-$95,000/year
- Senior/Inspector: $85,000-$110,000/year

**Major airlines/cargo (unionized):**
- Starting: $60,000-$75,000/year
- After 5-8 years: $135,000-$155,000/year

**Top-paying employers:**

- FedEx: $155,168 after 6 years
- Delta: $138,756 after 6.5 years
- American Airlines: $142,376 after 8 years

**Your situation:** As a 15T, you have helicopter maintenance experience. FAA requires A&P license for civilian aviation work, but your military experience counts toward requirements.

**Section 2: Getting Your A&P License (The Critical Step) (120 seconds)**

[Visual suggestion: A&P pathways comparison]

FAA Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) license is required for most civilian aviation mechanic jobs.

**Requirements:**
- 18 months experience in airframe OR powerplant
- OR 30 months combined experience
- OR completion of FAA-approved school

**Path 1: Military Experience Pathway (Fastest)**

Your 15T experience counts toward FAA requirements:
- Submit Form 8610-2 to FAA
- Provide military training documents
- FAA evaluates your experience
- You can test directly without school

**Reality:** FAA often approves 15T experience for A&P eligibility. Not guaranteed, but most 15Ts qualify.

**Cost:** $150-$200 per test (written, oral, practical for both Airframe and Powerplant = ~$1,200 total)

**Timeline:** 30-90 days if FAA approves your military experience

**Path 2: A&P School (If FAA Doesn't Accept Military Experience)**

FAA-approved aviation maintenance school:
- Duration: 18-24 months
- Cost: $20,000-$40,000 (GI Bill covers this)
- Guaranteed FAA testing eligibility
- More thorough civilian training

**Top A&P schools accepting GI Bill:**
- Aviation Institute of Maintenance (AIM)
- Spartan College of Aeronautics
- Redstone College
- Many community colleges

**Path 3: Helicopter-Specific Route**

Work as helicopter mechanic without A&P:
- Some helicopter operators hire on military experience
- Salary: $55,000-$75,000/year
- Work toward A&P while employed
- Slower path, but immediate income

**Recommendation:** Try military experience pathway first. If FAA denies, use GI Bill for A&P school.

**Growing field:** Modern aircraft = computers with wings
