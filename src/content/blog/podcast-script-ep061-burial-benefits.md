[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

Nobody wants to think about their own death or the death of a loved one. But here's what every veteran and military family needs to know: VA provides substantial burial benefits that can save families thousands of dollars during one of the most difficult times of their lives. In 2024, VA pays up to $978 burial allowance plus $978 plot allowance - nearly $2,000 total - for non-service-connected deaths. For service-connected deaths, up to $2,978. Beyond cash benefits, VA operates over 150 national cemeteries providing free burial, including gravesite, opening and closing of the grave, perpetual care, headstone, burial flag, and Presidential Memorial Certificate - all at zero cost to the family. And VA provides free headstones or markers for any veteran buried anywhere - even in private cemeteries - for life. The average funeral and burial costs $7,000-$12,000 in America. VA burial benefits can cover 25-40% of that cost, and national cemetery burial eliminates most costs entirely. But families must know these benefits exist and how to apply - preferably before they're needed. I'm Jacob, Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're covering exactly what VA burial benefits are available, how to qualify, the application process, and the special consideration for Arlington National Cemetery. This isn't a fun topic, but it's information that could save your family thousands and ensure you or your loved one receives the honor earned through military service. This is Veteran Transition Blueprint.

**The Three Types of VA Burial Benefits**

VA provides three separate categories of burial benefits. You might qualify for one, two, or all three depending on circumstances.

**Benefit #1 - Burial Allowance:** Cash payment to help cover funeral and burial costs. Amount varies based on whether death was service-connected.

**Benefit #2 - Plot Allowance:** Cash payment to help cover cost of burial plot or interment. Only applies if buried in private cemetery (not national cemetery).

**Benefit #3 - Burial in VA National Cemetery:** Free burial including gravesite, opening/closing, perpetual care, headstone, flag. This is not a cash payment - it's the actual burial service.

You can receive the burial and plot allowances (#1 and #2) if buried in a private cemetery. OR you can receive free burial in a national cemetery (#3). You don't get both - either cash to help with private burial, or free burial in national cemetery.

**Burial Allowance - The Cash Payment**

Let's start with the cash burial allowance that helps pay for funeral expenses.

**For deaths on or after October 1, 2024:** VA pays $978 burial allowance.

**For service-connected deaths:** VA pays up to $2,000 burial allowance. This is significantly more because VA recognizes that the death resulted from military service.

**What qualifies as service-connected death:**

- Death resulted from a service-connected disability (veteran rated for condition that caused or contributed to death)
- Veteran died while hospitalized by VA or in a VA-contracted facility
- Veteran died while traveling under VA authorization and at VA expense
- Death was directly caused by or resulted from a service-connected condition

**Example:** Veteran rated 70% for service-connected heart disease. Dies from heart attack. Medical evidence shows service-connected heart condition caused death. Family qualifies for $2,000 service-connected burial allowance.

**What qualifies for non-service-connected burial allowance ($978):**

- Veteran was receiving VA pension or compensation at time of death (even if death wasn't service-connected)
- Veteran died in a VA hospital (even if not receiving pension/compensation)
- Veteran was eligible for VA pension or compensation but not receiving it because they had other income sources

**Example:** Veteran rated 30% for tinnitus, receiving $524.31/month compensation. Dies in car accident unrelated to service. Family qualifies for $978 non-service-connected burial allowance because veteran was receiving compensation at time of death.

**Important limitation:** The non-service-connected burial allowance cannot exceed the actual cost of burial and funeral expenses. If your funeral costs $500, VA pays $500, not the full $978. For service-connected burial allowance, VA pays the full amount regardless of actual costs.

**Plot Allowance - Help with Burial Plot Costs**

Separate from the burial allowance, VA pays a plot allowance to help cover the cost of purchasing a burial plot in a private cemetery.

**Current amount (October 1, 2024 forward):** $978 plot allowance.

**Who qualifies:**

- Deaths from service-connected conditions
- Veterans who were receiving VA pension or compensation at time of death
- Veterans who died in VA hospital or VA-contracted facility

**Key point:** You only receive plot allowance if buried in a private cemetery. If buried in a VA national cemetery (which provides the plot free), you don't receive this payment. This makes sense - you either get a free plot at a national cemetery, or VA helps pay for a private cemetery plot.

**Combined burial and plot allowance for private cemetery burial:**

Non-service-connected: $978 + $978 = $1,956 toward private funeral and burial
Service-connected: $2,000 + $978 = $2,978 toward private funeral and burial

**These amounts are reimbursement.** You pay the funeral home and cemetery upfront, then file a claim with VA for reimbursement. VA doesn't pay the funeral home directly.

**Transportation Costs**

In certain situations, VA will reimburse transportation costs to move the veteran's remains to a national cemetery.

**Eligibility:** Death was service-connected, OR veteran died while being transported at VA expense, OR veteran died while in a VA hospital and was being transported to the place of burial at VA expense.

**What's covered:** Actual costs of transporting the remains, not to exceed the cost of transportation to the nearest national cemetery with available gravesites.

**This benefit is rarely used** because most families choose burial closer to home rather than transporting remains long distances.

**Burial in VA National Cemeteries - The Most Valuable Benefit**

This is often the most valuable burial benefit - free burial in one of VA's 150+ national cemeteries.

**What's included at no cost:**

- Gravesite in any VA national cemetery with available space
- Opening and closing of the grave
- Perpetual care of the gravesite (maintained by VA forever)
- Government headstone or marker
- Burial flag
- Presidential Memorial Certificate
- Military funeral honors (arranged separately through DoD, but coordinated with cemetery)

**What this saves families:** A burial plot in a private cemetery costs $1,000-$4,000 on average. Opening and closing the grave costs $1,000-$3,000. A headstone costs $1,500-$3,500. Perpetual care runs $500-$1,500. Total savings: $4,000-$12,000+ by using a VA national cemetery instead of private cemetery.

**Eligibility for national cemetery burial:**

**Veterans:** Any service member who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable qualifies. You don't need to have served 20 years, you don't need a disability rating, you don't need service-connected conditions. Just honorable discharge.

**Spouses:** The spouse of an eligible veteran can be buried in a national cemetery with the veteran. This applies even if the veteran predeceased the spouse - the spouse can still be buried in the national cemetery later.

**Dependent children:** Unmarried dependent children under 21 (or under 23 if in school) of eligible veterans can be buried in national cemeteries. Children who became permanently disabled before age 18 remain eligible for life.

**Important note on spouse eligibility:** If a surviving spouse remarries and later becomes widowed or divorced, they regain eligibility for burial in a national cemetery with their veteran spouse.

**How to arrange national cemetery burial:**

**Before need:** You can pre-plan and apply for eligibility determination before death occurs. This is highly recommended - it removes the burden from family during grief. Call the national cemetery where you'd like to be buried and request a pre-need eligibility determination.

**At time of need:** When death occurs, contact the national cemetery directly or have your funeral director contact them. The cemetery will schedule the burial based on availability, typically within 5-10 business days.

**No cost to apply.** No cost for burial. No hidden fees.

**Headstones and Markers - Available Anywhere**

Here's a benefit many veterans and families don't know about: VA provides free headstones or markers for eligible veterans buried ANYWHERE - including private cemeteries.

**What's provided:**

- Flat markers in granite, marble, or bronze
- Upright headstones in granite or marble
- Bronze niche markers for columbaria

**Inscriptions included:** Veteran's name, branch of service, year of birth, year of death, and war service dates. You can also add emblems of belief, military awards, and short personalization.

**What it costs:** Free. VA provides the headstone or marker at no charge. If placed in a VA national cemetery, VA also installs it free. If placed in a private cemetery, VA ships it to you free, but you pay for installation/setting (typically $300-$1,000).

**How to obtain:**

**For national cemeteries:** The cemetery orders it automatically based on information from the family. You don't file a separate application.

**For private cemeteries:** File VA Form 40-1330 (Claim for Standard Government Headstone or Marker). Can file online at VA.gov, by mail, or by fax. Processing takes 4-6 weeks, then VA ships the headstone to you or the cemetery.

**Eligibility:** Any veteran discharged under conditions other than dishonorable qualifies, regardless of when or where they served, whether they died during service or decades later.

**Replacement headstones:** If an existing headstone is damaged or becomes illegible, VA will provide a replacement at no cost.

**Presidential Memorial Certificate**

This is a simple but meaningful benefit: An engraved certificate signed by the current president honoring the veteran's military service.

**What it is:** A formal certificate with the veteran's name and a message recognizing their service and sacrifice.

**Eligibility:** Any veteran with honorable discharge, and their eligible dependents.

**How to obtain:** Request through VA using Presidential Memorial Certificate Request (VA Form 40-0247). Can request online at VA.gov, by mail, or through funeral director. There's no time limit - you can request it years after the veteran's death.

**No cost.** VA provides these free. You can request multiple copies for different family members.

**How to Apply for Burial Allowances**

Let's walk through the actual application process for the cash burial and plot allowances.

**Step One - Gather required documents:**

- Veteran's military discharge papers (DD-214 or equivalent)
- Death certificate
- Copies of funeral and burial bills showing costs paid
- If claiming service-connected burial, medical evidence linking death to service-connected condition

**Step Two - Complete VA Form 21P-530EZ:**

This is "Application for Burial Benefits." The form asks for:
- Veteran's identifying information
- Your relationship to veteran (as claimant)
- Date and place of death
- Whether death was service-connected
- Burial and funeral expenses paid
- Bank information for reimbursement

**Step Three - Submit your application:**

**Online (preferred):** Go to VA.gov/burials-memorials/veterans-burial-allowance/apply-for-allowance-form-21p-530ez/ and complete the application online. Fastest processing.

**By mail:** Send completed form and all supporting documents to VA regional office serving your area.

**By phone:** Call 1-800-827-1000 and a VA representative can help you file over the phone.

**Through VSO:** Veterans Service Organizations like VFW, DAV, or American Legion can help you complete and file the application.

**Step Four - Wait for decision:**

VA typically processes burial benefit claims within 3-6 months. If approved, reimbursement is sent via direct deposit to the bank account listed on your application or by check.

**Critical timing requirement:** For non-service-connected burial allowance, you must file within 2 years of the veteran's burial or cremation. After 2 years, you lose eligibility.

For service-connected burial allowance, plot allowance, and transportation reimbursement, there's no time limit. But don't wait - file within the first year to avoid delays and complications.

**Arlington National Cemetery - Special Consideration**

Arlington National Cemetery is the most well-known military cemetery, but it has the most restrictive eligibility requirements.

**Important distinction:** Arlington is NOT part of the VA national cemetery system. It's managed by the U.S. Army, not VA. Different rules apply.

**Two types of Arlington burial:**

**In-ground burial:** Extremely restrictive. Space has been limited since 1967. Generally limited to:
- Service members killed in action or who died on active duty
- Retirees with exceptionally distinguished military careers (Medal of Honor recipients, high-level military leadership, etc.)
- Specific Purple Heart recipients killed in action

**Above-ground inurnment (columbarium):** Much broader eligibility. Most veterans with honorable discharge and at least one day of active duty service (not just training) qualify for above-ground inurnment at Arlington.

**For most veterans:** If you want burial at Arlington, you'll qualify for above-ground inurnment (cremation urn placement in columbarium), not in-ground burial. The Army has tightened in-ground eligibility significantly due to space constraints.

**How to determine Arlington eligibility:** Visit arlingtoncemetery.mil or call 877-907-8585 to speak with Arlington staff about your specific situation.

**State Veterans Cemeteries:** Many states operate their own veterans cemeteries with benefits similar to VA national cemeteries. If no VA national cemetery is near you, check if your state has a state veterans cemetery. Eligibility and benefits are similar.

**Planning Ahead - What Veterans Should Do Now**

Don't wait until death is imminent to plan for burial benefits.

**Action #1 - Make your preference known:** Tell your family whether you want burial in a VA national cemetery or a private cemetery. Document it in writing.

**Action #2 - Gather documents:** Make sure your family knows where your DD-214 is stored. Keep copies in multiple places - with your important papers, with your spouse, with your attorney.

**Action #3 - Apply for pre-need eligibility:** If you want burial in a specific VA national cemetery, contact them now and apply for pre-need eligibility determination. They'll verify your eligibility and provide documentation, removing all doubt later.

**Action #4 - Consider pre-planning:** Many funeral homes offer pre-planning services. You can pre-arrange details and even pre-pay if desired. This removes the burden from your family.

**Action #5 - Inform family about burial benefits:** Make sure your spouse and adult children know VA provides burial allowances, free national cemetery burial, and free headstones. Many families don't know these benefits exist and pay full private costs unnecessarily.

**The Real Financial Impact**

Let's talk bottom line savings:

**Private cemetery burial without VA benefits:** Funeral services $4,000-$8,000 + burial plot $1,000-$4,000 + headstone $1,500-$3,500 + opening/closing $1,000-$3,000 = $7,500-$18,500 total

**Private cemetery burial WITH VA benefits:** Same costs, but VA reimburses $1,956 (non-service-connected) or $2,978 (service-connected). Out-of-pocket: $5,544-$15,522

**VA national cemetery burial:** Funeral services only: $4,000-$8,000 (can be reduced with simple service). Burial plot, opening/closing, headstone, perpetual care: $0 (provided by VA). Total: $4,000-$8,000 maximum

**Savings by using VA national cemetery over private:** $3,500-$10,500+ per burial

**For a married veteran couple both using VA national cemetery burial:** Lifetime savings of $7,000-$21,000 compared to private cemetery burials.

**These are significant savings during a time when families are emotionally devastated and financially vulnerable.**
