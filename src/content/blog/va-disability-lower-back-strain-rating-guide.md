# VA Disability Rating for Lower Back Strain: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Lower back strain (lumbosacral strain) is among the **top 10 most claimed VA disabilities**. Ratings range from **10% to 100%** under Diagnostic Code 5237, based primarily on your **range of motion** and whether you have **incapacitating episodes**. Most veterans receive **10-20%** for limited motion, but you can get higher ratings with documented muscle spasm, abnormal gait, or severely limited flexibility. The key to maximizing your rating is documenting your **worst flare-up days**, not your good days, and claiming **secondary conditions** like radiculopathy which add separate ratings. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Lumbosacral Strain and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Lumbosacral strain refers to injury or damage to the muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the lower back (lumbar spine region). It's one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions affecting service members due to the physical demands of military duty.

**Common military causes:**

- **Heavy lifting**: Equipment, ammunition, gear, supplies
- **Ruck marches**: Carrying 50-100+ lb packs for miles
- **Repetitive movements**: Loading/unloading, climbing, bending
- **Physical training**: High-impact exercises, obstacle courses
- **Airborne/parachute operations**: Landing impacts
- **Vehicle operations**: Vibration from tanks, HMMWVs, helicopters
- **Combat injuries**: Falls, blast exposure, carrying wounded
- **Body armor**: Wearing heavy protective equipment daily
- **Awkward postures**: Ship compartments, vehicle spaces, fighting positions
- **Sports/PT injuries**: Unit sports, mandatory fitness activities

**Why the VA recognizes back strain:**
Military service places extraordinary physical demands on the spine. The VA understands that even without a specific documented injury, years of wear and tear from service cause or contribute to back conditions.

## VA Rating Criteria for Lower Back Strain

Lower back strain is rated under **38 CFR § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237** using the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

### Rating Based on Range of Motion

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Forward flexion greater than 60° but not greater than 85°; OR combined range of motion greater than 120° but not greater than 235°; OR muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; OR vertebral body fracture with loss of 50% or more of height |
| **20%** | Forward flexion greater than 30° but not greater than 60°; OR combined range of motion not greater than 120°; OR muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis |
| **40%** | Forward flexion 30° or less; OR favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine |
| **50%** | Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine |
| **100%** | Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine |

### Understanding Range of Motion

**Normal thoracolumbar (lower back) range of motion:**
- Forward flexion: 0-90° (bending forward)
- Extension: 0-30° (bending backward)
- Left lateral flexion: 0-30° (bending left)
- Right lateral flexion: 0-30° (bending right)
- Left rotation: 0-30° (twisting left)
- Right rotation: 0-30° (twisting right)
- **Combined ROM: 240°** (all movements added together)

**What this means for your rating:**
- If you can bend forward 70°, you're at 10%
- If you can only bend forward 45°, you're at 20%
- If you can only bend forward 25°, you're at 40%

### Rating Based on Incapacitating Episodes

If you have Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS), you can be rated based on incapacitating episodes:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months |
| **20%** | Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months |
| **40%** | Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months |
| **60%** | Incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months |

**Important:** An "incapacitating episode" is legally defined as a period of acute signs and symptoms requiring **bed rest prescribed by a physician**. Self-prescribed bed rest doesn't count. Keep records when your doctor tells you to rest.

### Pain and Functional Loss

**38 CFR § 4.40 and 4.45** require the VA to consider:
- Pain on movement
- Weakened movement
- Excess fatigability
- Incoordination
- Painful motion
- Swelling, deformity, or atrophy from disuse
- Instability of station
- Disturbance of locomotion
- Interference with sitting, standing, and weight-bearing

**This is crucial:** Even if your measured range of motion doesn't meet the criteria for a higher rating, functional loss due to pain can increase your rating. Make sure to tell the examiner when pain begins during each movement.

### Flare-Ups

The C&P examiner must ask about and consider flare-ups. If you have periods where your back is significantly worse, this can support a higher rating. Document your flare-ups—how often they occur, what triggers them, and how much they limit your mobility during those periods.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**In-service documentation:**
- Service treatment records showing back complaints, treatment, or diagnosis
- Line of duty determinations for back injuries
- Physical profiles or duty limitations for back problems
- Sick call visits for back pain
- MRI, X-ray, or CT scan results from service
- Documentation of specific injury events

**Circumstantial evidence of in-service cause:**
- MOS requiring heavy physical labor
- Airborne or special operations service
- Combat deployment (carrying heavy gear)
- Physical fitness test results showing decline
- Statements about duties involving back strain

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA C&P exam diagnosis** (required for rating)
2. **Private physician diagnosis** with nexus statement
3. **Recent imaging** (X-ray, MRI, CT scan) showing:
   - Degenerative disc disease
   - Disc bulges or herniations
   - Arthritis changes
   - Stenosis

### Severity Evidence

1. **Medical records documenting:**
   - Frequency of treatment
   - Medications prescribed (muscle relaxants, pain medications)
   - Physical therapy records
   - Injections or other procedures
   - Surgical history

2. **Personal statement describing:**
   - Daily pain levels
   - Activities you can no longer do
   - Impact on work
   - Flare-up frequency and severity
   - Sleep disruption
   - Need for assistive devices

3. **Employment records showing:**
   - Accommodations needed
   - Missed work due to back problems
   - Job changes due to limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The back C&P exam is one of the most important for determining your rating. Here's what happens:

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file and medical records
2. Ask about your back history and symptoms
3. **Measure your range of motion** (this largely determines your rating)
4. Test for muscle spasm and guarding
5. Check your gait (how you walk)
6. Assess spinal contour
7. Perform neurological tests if radiculopathy is claimed

**Range of Motion Testing:**

The examiner will have you:
- Bend forward (flexion)
- Bend backward (extension)
- Bend to each side (lateral flexion)
- Twist to each side (rotation)

**Critical:** They measure where you stop, not where you could go with maximum effort. They should also note where pain begins and test again after repetitive motion (3 times) to see if range decreases.

**What to tell them:**

1. **Report where pain begins**: "I start feeling pain at about 45 degrees"
2. **Describe functional loss**: "After bending a few times, I can barely move"
3. **Explain your worst days**: "During flare-ups, I can barely get out of bed"
4. **Mention all symptoms**: pain, stiffness, muscle spasm, radiation into legs
5. **Describe impact on daily life**: "I can't sit for more than 30 minutes"

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Trying to push through pain**: Stop when it hurts—that's the measurement that matters
- **Having a "good day" at the exam**: If today is unusually good, tell the examiner your normal and worst days
- **Forgetting flare-ups**: Describe how bad it gets and how often
- **Not mentioning radiating pain**: This could support a separate radiculopathy claim
- **Wearing restrictive clothing**: Wear loose clothes so you can move freely
- **Taking pain medication right before**: Your medicated state isn't your baseline

**Documentation the examiner should complete:**
- Range of motion measurements (initial and after repetition)
- Whether pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination limit function
- Presence of muscle spasm or guarding
- Abnormal gait or spinal contour
- Flare-up frequency, duration, and additional limitation
- Opinion on limitation during flare-ups

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Lower Back Strain

Your back condition often causes or contributes to other issues:

1. **Radiculopathy (Lower Extremity)** - Diagnostic Codes 8520-8530
   - Nerve pain radiating into legs/feet
   - Each leg rated separately: 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%
   - Symptoms: shooting pain, numbness, tingling, weakness
   - Very commonly secondary to back conditions

2. **Sciatica** - Diagnostic Code 8520
   - Specific type of radiculopathy affecting sciatic nerve
   - Rated per leg based on severity

3. **Cervical Strain (Neck)** - Diagnostic Code 5237
   - Compensating for lower back often strains neck
   - Same rating criteria as lumbar spine

4. **Hip Conditions** - Diagnostic Code 5252, 5253
   - Altered gait causes hip problems
   - Can be secondary to back condition

5. **Knee Conditions** - Diagnostic Code 5260, 5261
   - Altered gait and weight distribution
   - Commonly secondary to back problems

6. **Erectile Dysfunction** - Diagnostic Code 7522
   - Nerve involvement can affect function
   - Secondary to back conditions affecting nerves

7. **Depression/Anxiety** - Diagnostic Code 9434, 9400
   - Chronic pain commonly causes mental health issues
   - Rated 0-100%

8. **Sleep Disorder/Insomnia**
   - Pain disrupts sleep
   - Can support mental health claims

9. **Bladder/Bowel Dysfunction** - Various codes
   - Severe nerve involvement
   - Indicates serious spinal condition

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "No current diagnosis"
**Why it happens:** C&P exam doesn't find diagnosable condition
**How to avoid:**
- Get private diagnosis with imaging before filing
- Bring copies of MRI/X-ray reports to exam

### 2. "No nexus to service"
**Why it happens:** Examiner attributes back condition to aging or civilian causes
**How to avoid:**
- Document in-service complaints or injuries
- Explain physical demands of your MOS
- Get buddy statements about heavy lifting/duties

### 3. "Range of motion doesn't meet criteria"
**Why it happens:** Good day at exam, pushed through pain
**How to avoid:**
- Stop movements when pain begins
- Explain flare-ups and functional limitations
- Describe worst days, not best days

### 4. "No incapacitating episodes documented"
**Why it happens:** No physician-prescribed bed rest on record
**How to avoid:**
- Ask doctor to prescribe rest during flare-ups
- Keep documentation of when told to rest

### 5. "Pre-existing condition"
**Why it happens:** Back problems noted before service
**How to avoid:**
- Argue aggravation during service
- Show worsening documented in service records
- Explain how military duties aggravated condition

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I don't have documented back problems in my service records?
Many veterans didn't complain about back pain during service. You can still win your claim by documenting your physical duties, providing buddy statements, and establishing that your current condition is consistent with military service. The VA considers circumstantial evidence.

### Can I get more than 40% without ankylosis?
Under the standard rating formula, 40% requires forward flexion of 30° or less OR favorable ankylosis. However, you can combine your back rating with separate ratings for radiculopathy (each leg), which can significantly increase your overall rating.

### What's the difference between strain and degenerative disc disease?
Lumbosacral strain (DC 5237) refers to muscle/ligament injury, while degenerative disc disease (DC 5242) and intervertebral disc syndrome (DC 5243) involve disc deterioration. All are rated similarly under the spine rating formula, though IVDS can also be rated based on incapacitating episodes. Most veterans have elements of multiple conditions.

### Should I claim my back before or after an MRI?
Having imaging before filing strengthens your claim significantly. An MRI showing disc bulges, herniations, or degenerative changes provides objective evidence of your condition.

### Can I get separate ratings for upper and lower back?
Yes. Cervical (neck) and thoracolumbar (mid and lower back) conditions are rated separately. If you have problems with both, claim both.

### What if my back has gotten worse since my rating?
File a claim for increased rating. You'll receive a new C&P exam. Make sure to document any treatment, new imaging, and increased functional limitations since your last rating.

### How do I prove my back condition is service-connected if my MOS was administrative?
Even desk jobs involve physical requirements—mandatory PT, weapons qualification, field exercises, and deployments. Document all physical demands of your service, not just your primary job duties.
