## Bottom Line Up Front

**Agent Orange exposure during Vietnam War service qualifies for extensive VA presumptive conditions.** Veterans who served in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, or Thailand during Vietnam War era are presumed exposed to Agent Orange. VA maintains extensive list of presumptive conditions including cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and others. No nexus letter required; VA assumes causation for qualifying conditions. Processing time 90-120 days; approval rates 85%+ for properly documented claims. Agent Orange claims are among the most generous VA presumptive programs with 15+ presumptive conditions.

## What Is Agent Orange and Exposure Details

### Background
- **Military herbicide**: Used extensively during Vietnam War to defoliate jungle
- **Widespread exposure**: Veterans who served in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand during War era assumed exposed
- **Dioxin contamination**: Agent Orange contained dioxin (TCDD), extremely toxic chemical
- **Health effects**: Documented health effects decades after exposure
- **VA presumption**: Service in Vietnam-era locations = presumed Agent Orange exposure (no need to prove actual exposure)

### Service-Connected Exposure Locations
- **Vietnam**: Anywhere in Vietnam during service (1962-1975)
- **Cambodia**: Service in Cambodia during 1962-1973
- **Laos**: Service in Laos during 1962-1973
- **Thailand**: Service at specific Thai bases known to have Agent Orange (U-Tapao, etc.)
- **Agent Orange Registry**: Veterans from other locations can join registry if exposed

## Eligibility Requirements

### Presumed Exposure Requirement

**Service in Vietnam-Era Locations:**
- Military service in Vietnam (anywhere in country, any date 1962-1975)
- OR service in Cambodia, Laos, or Thailand during Vietnam War era
- Service records show deployment to these locations
- **No need to prove actual Agent Orange exposure**: Presumed by location and dates

**Helpful Documentation:**
- DD 214 (discharge papers) showing Vietnam service
- Military service records showing deployment locations/dates
- Unit history (if records unclear)
- **Key dates:** 1962-1975 for Vietnam; 1962-1973 for Cambodia/Laos; specific dates for Thailand bases

### Presumptive Condition Requirement

**Medical Diagnosis:**
- Medical diagnosis of presumptive condition
- Documented in VA or private medical records
- Diagnosis at any time after exposure (can develop decades later)
- Diagnosis explicitly states condition (not "possible cancer," but "lung cancer diagnosis")

---

## Evidence Requirements (Simplified)

### Proof of Service

**Military Service Records:**
- DD 214 showing Vietnam service
- Military deployment documentation
- Service records indicating location/dates
- **Most important**: Service record explicitly shows Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, or Thailand service during War era

**If Records Missing:**
- Buddy statements confirming service
- Military unit records
- VA can research service in many cases
- Register with Agent Orange Registry (aids documentation)

### Medical Evidence

**Medical Diagnosis:**
- Explicit diagnosis of presumptive condition in medical records
- Diagnosed by any medical provider (VA or private)
- Medical documentation supporting diagnosis

**Diagnostic Testing:**
- Objective testing supporting diagnosis (blood tests, imaging, etc.)
- Medical records documenting condition severity
- Treatment history for condition

---

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Confirm Vietnam-Era Service (Week 1)

**Gather Service Documentation:**
- Discharge papers (DD 214)
- Service records
- Confirm service location: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, or Thailand
- Confirm service dates in relevant time period

### Step 2: Obtain Medical Diagnosis (Weeks 1-4)

**Existing Diagnosis:**
- Gather medical records documenting condition diagnosis
- VA or private medical provider diagnosis acceptable

**If Not Yet Diagnosed:**
- Schedule medical appointment for condition evaluation
- VA or private provider diagnosis both acceptable
- Timeline: 2-8 weeks depending on medical need

### Step 3: File Presumptive Claim (Week 5)

**Use Form 21-0960 (Standard Disability Claim):**
- Mark as presumptive condition claim
- List presumptive condition (e.g., "Type 2 diabetes presumptive to Agent Orange exposure")
- Service location: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, or Thailand
- Service dates at that location

**Simplified Narrative:**
"I am claiming [presumptive condition] presumptive to Agent Orange exposure. I served in Vietnam [or Cambodia/Laos/Thailand] from [dates]. I have been diagnosed with [condition], a presumptive condition for Agent Orange exposure. No nexus letter is required for presumptive conditions; VA presumes causation based on service location and dates."

### Step 4: Compile Documentation (Week 6)

**Agent Orange Presumptive Claim Package:**
1. Form 21-0960
2. DD 214 (or service records)
3. Medical diagnosis documentation
4. Optional: Additional medical records
5. **NO NEXUS LETTER REQUIRED**

### Step 5: File and Track Claim (Week 7)

**File at VA.gov or mail to VA Regional Office**

**Key Advantage:** Presumptive claims process faster than non-presumptive; no need for nexus letter or extensive causation evidence.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Service Location Uncertainty
**Mistake:** Filing without clear documentation of Vietnam service location/dates.

**Fix:** Provide DD 214 explicitly showing Vietnam service. Include service dates. Clear documentation eliminates processing delays.

### 2. Non-Presumptive Condition Claims
**Mistake:** Filing for non-presumptive condition expecting presumptive approval.

**Fix:** Check Agent Orange presumptive list first. File for presumptive conditions; file for non-presumptive with nexus letter.

### 3. Vague Medical Diagnosis
**Mistake:** Filing with "possible diabetes" or "suspected condition" instead of formal diagnosis.

**Fix:** Request explicit medical diagnosis from provider. Diagnosis must be documented in medical records.

### 4. Multiple Presumptive Conditions
**Mistake:** Listing multiple presumptive conditions without ensuring each is diagnosed.

**Fix:** File for conditions you've actually been diagnosed with. Don't speculate about conditions you might have.

### 5. Child/Offspring Claims Confusion
**Mistake:** Misunderstanding rules for presumptive conditions affecting veterans' children.

**Fix:** Agent Orange causes specific birth defects in veterans' children. File for children's birth defects, not your own condition. Different process.

## Presumptive Conditions for Veterans' Children

### Covered Birth Defects
Children of Vietnam veterans presumed to have Agent Orange-related birth defects include:
- Spina bifida
- Cleft palate
- Clubfoot
- Other specified birth defects
- Children born before service (not presumptive); children born after service (presumptive)

### Filing for Children
- Use different form (VA form for birth defects)
- Proof: child's birth defect diagnosis + parent's Vietnam service
- Similar presumptive approach; different process

---

- Optional registry for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange
- Helps document exposure and health conditions
- Can strengthen claims even for presumptive conditions

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to prove Agent Orange caused my condition?
**A:** No. Service in Vietnam (or specified other locations) during War era creates presumption of exposure. VA assumes causation for presumptive conditions.

### Q: Can I file for multiple presumptive conditions?
**A:** Yes. If diagnosed with multiple conditions, file for all. Separate ratings apply.

### Q: What rating will I receive?
**A:** Rating depends on condition severity: diabetes might be 10-20%; cancer might be 50%+; Parkinson's might be 30-50%. Functional impairment determines rating.

### Q: How long after service can I file?
**A:** Agent Orange conditions can appear decades post-service. You can file at any time. Many veterans file 30+ years after Vietnam service.

### Q: What if my service records are incomplete?
**A:** VA can research service in many cases. Provide best information available (unit, approximate dates, location). Buddy statements help if records missing.

### Q: Do I need to be in Vietnam Veterans organization to file?
**A:** No. Any Vietnam-era service at presumed exposure location qualifies. No organization membership required.
