# Rhode Island Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Rhode Island's standout veteran tax benefit is the complete exemption of military retirement income from state income tax—saving retirees $2,000-$3,500+ annually. For 100% disabled veterans, the state offers free vehicle registration, free license plates, property tax relief up to $3,000, and free admission to state parks.

Rhode Island ranks in the middle tier nationally for veteran tax benefits. The military retirement exemption (implemented in 2023) is excellent, but property tax exemptions are modest compared to states like Texas or Florida. A 100% disabled veteran with $50,000 military retirement saves approximately $3,500-$4,500 annually compared to neighboring Massachusetts.

The property tax exemption structure is municipality-based: disabled veterans can receive exemptions ranging from $306 to $3,000 depending on disability rating and location. Providence offers $306 for regular veterans and $614 for 100% service-connected disabled veterans. 100% disabled veterans also receive free vehicle registration and license plates—no annual fees at all.

Downsides? Rhode Island has high property taxes overall (average effective rate 1.39%, 13th highest nationally), and the veteran exemption only reduces assessed value by up to $3,000—which translates to modest tax savings of $40-$60 in most cities. Cost of living is also high, with median home prices around $455,000 statewide.

Overall verdict: Rhode Island is very good for military retirees (full income tax exemption) and excellent for 100% disabled veterans (free registration plus parking and park benefits), but property tax relief is limited. If you're under 100% disabled without military retirement income, benefits are minimal.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans (Service-Connected):**
- Exemption: $614 in Providence; varies by municipality (typically $500-$3,000 assessed value reduction)
- Requirements: 100% service-connected disability from VA
- Annual savings: $40-$60 depending on municipality and tax rate
- Additional benefit: Free vehicle registration and plates

Rhode Island uses an assessed value reduction system rather than a percentage exemption. If you're rated 100% disabled by the VA and your municipality offers a $3,000 exemption on assessed value, and your local tax rate is $20 per $1,000, you save $60 annually ($3,000 ÷ 1,000 × $20 = $60).

**Example in Providence:**
- Total disabled veteran exemption: $614
- Providence residential tax rate: approximately $17.23 per $1,000 (FY2025)
- Annual tax savings: approximately $10.58

The exemption amounts vary significantly by municipality. Some towns offer higher exemptions than others, so check with your local tax assessor.

**Partially Disabled Veterans:**
- Regular veteran exemption: $306 in Providence (varies by municipality)
- Requirements: Honorable discharge; other-than-dishonorable discharge qualifies
- Annual savings: $5-$10 depending on municipality

Veterans with service-connected disabilities under 100% may still receive the standard veteran exemption available in their municipality, though it won't be as generous as the 100% disabled rate.

**Purple Heart Recipients:**
- Benefit: Free vehicle registration and license plates (no annual fees)
- Requirements: Purple Heart medal for combat wounds
- Annual savings: $100-$200 (registration fees)

**Former Prisoners of War:**
- Benefit: Free vehicle registration and license plates
- Requirements: POW designation
- Annual savings: $100-$200

**Gold Star Parents:**
- Benefit: Exemption category available (varies by municipality)
- Requirements: Parent of service member who died in service

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local tax assessor** (Providence, Warwick, Cranston, Newport, or your town)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4, showing honorable or other-than-dishonorable discharge)
   - VA award letter showing service-connected disability rating
   - Proof of Rhode Island residency
   - Property deed

3. **File application with local assessor**
   - Contact your city/town tax assessor's office
   - Applications typically due by deadline set by municipality (often December 31 for following tax year)
   - Processing: 30-60 days
   - Effective: Tax year following approval

**Important:** Exemptions can be applied to either real estate OR motor vehicle tax, but not both. Choose the higher tax bill for maximum benefit.

### Property Tax by City

Rhode Island has the 13th highest property taxes nationally (average effective rate 1.39%). Here's what veterans can expect in major cities:

| City | Median Home Value | Tax Rate (per $1,000) | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | 100% Disabled Exemption | Annual Savings |
|------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Providence | $484,000 | $17.23 | $8,339 | $614 assessed value | ~$11 |
| Warwick | $425,000 | $12.70 | $5,398 | Varies by town | ~$40-60 |
| Cranston | $440,000 | ~$15.00 | $6,600 | Varies | ~$40-60 |
| Newport | $531,000 | ~$12.70 | $6,744 | Varies | ~$40-60 |
| Pawtucket | $315,000 | ~$16.00 | $5,040 | Varies | ~$40-60 |

**Example:** A 100% disabled veteran with a $425,000 home in Warwick could save approximately $40-$60 annually if the town offers a $3,000 assessed value exemption. Not huge, but combined with other benefits (free registration, free state park admission), it adds up.

The modest property tax savings mean Rhode Island's property tax benefit ranks below states like Texas (full exemption for 100% disabled), Florida ($5,000 exemption), or New Hampshire (full exemption for 100% P&T).

### Municipalities with Higher Exemptions

Some Rhode Island municipalities offer more generous veteran exemptions than others. According to the Municipal Finance Office's Veterans-Senior Exemptions Report, exemption amounts can range from a few hundred dollars to $3,000+ in assessed value reduction.

Contact your specific town tax assessor for current exemption amounts:
- Each of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns sets its own exemption levels
- The state law establishes categories (regular veteran, partially disabled, totally disabled, widow, POW, Gold Star parent)
- Municipalities determine actual dollar amounts within those categories

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—Rhode Island fully exempts military retirement from state income tax**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Effective date: January 1, 2023
- Annual savings: $2,000-$3,500+ compared to taxing states

Starting in 2023, Rhode Island completely eliminated state income tax on military retirement pay. This was a major policy change that makes Rhode Island one of the more tax-friendly states for military retirees.

**How it works:**
- Military retirees subtract their military pension from federal adjusted gross income when calculating Rhode Island taxable income
- No age limit, no income cap, no phase-in
- The exemption continues for surviving spouses receiving Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments
- This is separate from (and more generous than) Rhode Island's general pension modification

**Example savings:**

- **O-5 retiree with $60,000 pension:**
  - In Massachusetts (5% rate): $3,000 state tax
  - In Rhode Island: $0
  - **Annual savings: $3,000**

- **E-7 retiree with $35,000 pension:**
  - In Connecticut (top rate 6.99%): $2,447 state tax
  - In Rhode Island: $0
  - **Annual savings: $2,447**

- **O-6 retiree with $75,000 pension:**
  - In Vermont (top rate 8.75%): $6,563 state tax
  - In Rhode Island: $0
  - **Annual savings: $6,563**

Rhode Island's personal income tax has a top rate of 5.99% (for income over $158,550 in 2025). The military retirement exemption saves veterans thousands annually.

**Important distinction:** Rhode Island still has a general retirement income modification that applies to other pensions (401k, private pensions, Social Security). For tax year 2023 and beyond, this modification is limited to $20,000 with income restrictions. Military retirement receives FULL exemption regardless of amount or other income.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt federally and in all states
- Rhode Island: Not taxed
- No state taxes VA disability anywhere

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere. Rhode Island doesn't tax it either.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Rhode Island taxation: **$0 (fully exempt as military retirement)**
- Federal: Taxed federally
- Effective: 2023 forward

Surviving spouses receiving Survivor Benefit Plan payments from a deceased military retiree benefit from the same military retirement exemption. SBP is not subject to Rhode Island income tax.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Subject to RI income tax (rates 3.75%-5.99%)
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; RI doesn't tax it (if federally exempt)
- **Active duty pay:** Subject to RI income tax if you're a RI resident; protected under SCRA if you maintain out-of-state residency

Rhode Island only exempts military RETIREMENT pay, not active duty pay or drilling pay.

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Cost: **Free vehicle registration** (no annual fees)
- Cost: **Free disabled veteran license plates**
- Parking: Access to disabled parking with placard
- Annual savings: $100-$200 (registration fees and parking)

If you're determined by the VA to have a 100% service-connected disability, you receive free registration and plates. There's no limit on the number of vehicles, though you must pay commercial fees for commercial vehicles over 12,000 lbs.

**Purple Heart Recipients:**
- Cost: **Free Purple Heart license plates**
- Cost: **Free registration**
- Annual savings: $100-$200

Combat wounded veterans who received the Purple Heart Medal get free plates and registration.

**Former Prisoners of War:**
- Cost: **Free POW license plates**
- Cost: **Free registration**
- Annual savings: $100-$200

**General Veterans (All Honorably Discharged):**
- Veteran plates available
- No service charge or transfer charge for veteran plates
- Must still pay standard registration fees
- Annual savings: $20-$30 (service/transfer charges)

All honorably discharged veterans can get veteran plates without paying the service or transfer charge, though regular registration fees still apply unless you're 100% disabled, Purple Heart, or POW.

**Surviving Spouses:**
- All special plates (100% disabled, Purple Heart, POW) can transfer to the unremarried surviving spouse for their lifetime
- Free registration benefits transfer as well

**How to apply:**
- Contact RI Division of Motor Vehicles: (401) 462-4368
- Website: dmv.ri.gov
- Bring DD-214, VA disability letter (if applicable), Purple Heart orders (if applicable)

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **7%** (Rhode Island has a sales tax)
- Vehicle purchases: Subject to sales tax (7% up to $250,000; 8% on amount over $250,000)
- Goods and services: Taxed at 7%
- No veteran exemption

Rhode Island charges a 7% sales tax on most purchases. There are no veteran-specific exemptions from sales tax.

**Example:** Buying a $40,000 truck:
- Rhode Island sales tax: $2,800
- Compared to New Hampshire (0% sales tax): $2,800 more expensive

The lack of sales tax exemption for veterans means less benefit than no-sales-tax states like New Hampshire or Delaware.

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% Disabled Veteran (Providence, $484,000 home, $50,000 military retirement):**
- Property tax saved: ~$11 (modest exemption)
- Income tax saved (vs. Massachusetts): $4,000
- Vehicle registration saved: $200
- State park admission saved: $100
- **Total Annual Savings vs. Massachusetts: $4,311**
- **Total savings vs. non-exempt RI resident: $4,311**

**70% Disabled, Military Retiree ($40,000 retirement):**
- Property tax saved: ~$5 (regular veteran exemption)
- Income tax saved: $3,200
- Vehicle registration: Not exempt (pay regular fees)
- **Total annual savings: $3,205**

**Military Retiree, No Disability ($40,000 retirement):**
- Property tax saved: ~$5 (regular veteran exemption)
- Income tax saved: $3,200
- Vehicle registration: Not exempt
- **Total annual savings: $3,205**

The military retirement exemption is the biggest benefit. Property tax exemptions are modest across all categories.

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled Veteran:**
- Annual savings (vs. MA): $4,311
- 20-year total: $86,220
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $64,200

**70% Disabled Military Retiree:**
- Annual savings: $3,205
- 20-year total: $64,100
- NPV: $47,700

**Military Retiree (No Disability):**
- Annual savings: $3,205
- 20-year total: $64,100
- NPV: $47,700

Over 20 years, Rhode Island's military retirement exemption saves significant money, but it's not as generous as states with no income tax (Florida, Texas, Nevada) or states with massive property tax exemptions (Texas, Oklahoma).

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $50K Retirement, $484K Home) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rhode Island** | Exempt (since 2023) | ~$11-$60 | $4,311 |
| Massachusetts | Exempt | $750 | $750 |
| Connecticut | Partially exempt | $1,500 | $2,500 |
| New Hampshire | Exempt (no income tax) | Full exemption + $701 credit | $14,000+ |
| Vermont | Partially exempt | $40,000 assessed value | $3,500 |
| New York | Exempt (up to $41,000) | Varies by county | $2,500 |

**Verdict:** Rhode Island ranks **#2** among New England states for military retirees (behind New Hampshire), and middle-of-the-pack for disabled veterans. The military retirement exemption is excellent, but property tax benefits are modest.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** Top tier—full exemption of military retirement
- **Property tax exemption:** Bottom tier—modest assessed value reductions
- **Vehicle registration:** Top tier—free for 100% disabled, Purple Heart, POW
- **Overall ranking:** **Middle tier nationally** for military retirees; **lower tier** for disabled veterans under 100%

Rhode Island's 2023 military retirement exemption significantly improved its ranking for retirees. However, property tax benefits remain limited compared to states like Texas (full exemption for 100% disabled), Florida ($5,000 exemption), or South Carolina (up to $50,000 exemption).

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- Military retirees with pensions over $40,000 (save $3,000-$6,000+ annually on income tax)
- 100% disabled veterans (free registration, free plates, free parks, modest property tax relief)
- Purple Heart recipients (free plates and registration)
- Former POWs (free plates and registration)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (MA, CT, NY, VT)
- Veterans who want to live in New England with good state benefits

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans rated 30-90% disabled (minimal property tax relief)
- Veterans without military retirement income (no income tax benefit)
- Veterans seeking maximum property tax relief (other states offer more)

**Better options:**
- If you want no income tax AND massive property tax exemptions, consider Texas or Florida
- If you want the best New England state for 100% disabled veterans, consider New Hampshire (full property tax exemption)
- If you want low cost of living with good veteran benefits, consider South Carolina or Oklahoma

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- Rhode Island estate tax: **Yes** (estates over $1,733,264 in 2025)
- Rhode Island inheritance tax: None
- Veteran exemptions: No special veteran exemptions

Rhode Island is one of only 12 states with an estate tax. The threshold is $1,733,264 (2025), with rates up to 16% on amounts over that threshold. This affects wealthier veterans with significant estates.

**Tip:** Estate planning strategies (trusts, gifting) can minimize estate tax exposure. Consult a tax professional if your estate approaches $1.7 million.

### Other Benefits for 100% Disabled Veterans

**State Park Admission:**
- 100% disabled veterans: **Free admission** to all RI state parks
- Includes parking fees at beaches
- Annual value: $100+ (beach parking can be $10-20/day in summer)
- How to get: Bring VA disability letter to RI State Parks Headquarters (1100 Tower Hill Road, North Kingstown) Monday-Friday 9am-3pm

**Hunting & Fishing Licenses:**
- 100% disabled veterans: **Free permanent license** to hunt and/or fish
- Covers freshwater fishing and hunting
- Saltwater fishing: No license required but must have VA letter while fishing
- Annual value: $50-$100
- How to get: Apply at RIO.RI.GOV or authorized vendors with photo ID and VA disability letter

**Total additional value for 100% disabled veterans:** $150-$300/year in park admission, parking, and hunting/fishing licenses.

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish Rhode Island residency immediately.** Get a RI driver's license (free if 100% disabled with VA-provided vehicle or amputee/paraplegic), register to vote, update DFAS address.

2. **Apply for property tax exemption within first tax year.** Contact your local tax assessor, file before the deadline (often December 31), and choose whether to apply exemption to real estate or motor vehicle (choose the higher tax bill).

3. **Apply for disabled veteran plates and free registration if you're 100% disabled, Purple Heart, or POW.** Free plates, free registration—worth $100-$200/year. Apply at RI DMV.

4. **Update DFAS withholding.** Stop withholding Rhode Island state income tax on your military retirement (it's fully exempt). Update at myPay.dfas.mil.

5. **Get your free state park pass if you're 100% disabled.** Visit RI State Parks Headquarters with VA letter. Save $100+ annually on beach parking.

6. **Get your free hunting/fishing license if you're 100% disabled.** Apply at RIO.RI.GOV or authorized vendor. Save $50-$100/year.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not applying for property tax exemption by deadline:** You'll pay full property tax for that year. Even though the exemption is modest, every dollar counts.

- **Claiming exemption on wrong property:** Choose real estate OR motor vehicle, whichever has the higher tax bill. For most veterans, real estate is the better choice.

- **Not claiming free vehicle registration:** 100% disabled, Purple Heart, and POW veterans get free registration. Don't pay if you qualify.

- **Continuing to withhold RI state tax from military retirement:** Update DFAS immediately after establishing RI residency to stop withholding state tax on your pension.

- **Not maximizing other 100% disabled benefits:** Free parks, free hunting/fishing—these benefits add up to $200-$300/year. Claim them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I pay state income tax on my military retirement in Rhode Island?**

A: No. Starting January 1, 2023, Rhode Island fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax. No age limit, no income cap.

**Q: What's the property tax exemption amount for 100% disabled veterans in Rhode Island?**

A: It varies by municipality. In Providence, 100% service-connected disabled veterans receive $614 assessed value reduction. Other towns offer $500-$3,000. Contact your local tax assessor for your town's specific exemption amount.

**Q: Can I apply the veteran property tax exemption to both my house and my car?**

A: No. You must choose either real estate OR motor vehicle tax, but not both. Most veterans choose real estate because the tax bill is typically higher.

**Q: Do I get free vehicle registration if I'm 70% disabled?**

A: No. Free registration is only for 100% service-connected disabled veterans, Purple Heart recipients, and former POWs.

**Q: Does the property tax exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. It can only be applied to one property—either your primary residence or one motor vehicle.

**Q: I'm 100% P&T disabled. Do I need to reapply every year?**

A: Check with your local assessor. Some municipalities require periodic recertification, while others automatically renew the exemption.

**Q: Can my surviving spouse keep the benefits if I die?**

A: Yes. The military retirement income tax exemption continues for surviving spouses receiving SBP. Free vehicle registration and plates transfer to unremarried surviving spouses for their lifetime.

**Q: I'm TDIU (rated 70% but 100% unemployable). Do I qualify for 100% disabled veteran benefits?**

A: For property tax exemptions, check with your local assessor. TDIU may qualify you for the 100% disabled exemption in some municipalities. For vehicle registration, you need to be rated 100% service-connected (not TDIU) to qualify for free registration.

**Q: Does Rhode Island tax Social Security benefits?**

A: Rhode Island does tax Social Security benefits, but only if your federal adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds ($88,950 single / $111,200 joint for 2025). Most military retirees with modest Social Security won't pay RI tax on their Social Security.

**Q: I'm active duty stationed in Rhode Island but my home of record is Texas. Do I pay RI taxes?**

A: Under SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act), you can maintain your Texas residency and not pay RI income tax on your military pay. Texas has no income tax, so you pay $0 state tax.

**Q: What if I move from one RI town to another?**

A: You need to reapply for the property tax exemption with your new town's assessor. The exemption doesn't automatically transfer between municipalities, and the exemption amount may differ.

**Q: Are there local income taxes in Rhode Island?**

A: No. There are no local or municipal income taxes in Rhode Island.

**Q: Do I get a property tax exemption if I'm a Purple Heart recipient but under 100% disabled?**

A: For property tax, you'd receive the standard veteran exemption in your municipality (typically $200-$500). The Purple Heart medal qualifies you for free vehicle registration and plates, but not enhanced property tax exemptions unless you're also 100% disabled.

**Q: How much do I save on sales tax as a veteran in Rhode Island?**

A: Rhode Island charges 7% sales tax with no veteran exemptions. You don't save on sales tax unless you buy items in a no-sales-tax state like New Hampshire.

**Q: Can I get both free vehicle registration and the property tax exemption?**

A: Yes, if you're 100% disabled. You receive free registration AND the property tax exemption. However, you must choose whether to apply the property tax exemption to real estate or a motor vehicle. Since your vehicle registration is already free, apply the exemption to your real estate for maximum benefit.

**Q: What if I have a 100% VA rating but it's not permanent?**

A: Check with your local tax assessor and RI DMV. Some benefits may require permanent and total (P&T) status, while others accept 100% ratings even if not permanent. Bring your VA rating letter showing 100% service-connected disability.

**Q: How does Rhode Island's military retirement exemption compare to the general pension exemption?**

A: Military retirement is FULLY exempt regardless of amount or other income. The general pension modification (for private pensions, 401k, etc.) is limited to $20,000 with income restrictions. Military retirees get much better treatment.

**Q: I'm a disabled veteran who received a vehicle from the VA. Are there additional benefits?**

A: Yes. Veterans provided a vehicle by the VA (typically amputees, paraplegics, or blind veterans) receive a free driver's license in addition to free registration and plates. Check with RI DMV for documentation requirements.
