# North Dakota Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

North Dakota offers solid veteran healthcare through the **Fargo VA Medical Center** and **10 community-based outpatient clinics** covering all major cities (Bismarck, Minot, Grand Forks, Williston, Dickinson). The system serves 34,000+ veterans across North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and northeast South Dakota. Wait times are generally shorter than larger VA systems, and rural veterans benefit from extensive clinic coverage—you're never more than 90 minutes from VA care.

For education, the **University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University** both participate in the **Yellow Ribbon Program** with unlimited student slots, covering 100% of tuition for Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients. North Dakota also offers a **25% tuition waiver + 75% grant** for National Guard members and **free tuition for 45 months** for dependents of 100% disabled or killed-in-action veterans.

**Employment opportunities are excellent**, with North Dakota's veteran unemployment at just **2.3%** (among the lowest nationally). Oil and gas jobs in the **Bakken oil fields** pay $50,000-$112,000+ annually. **Minot AFB** (economic impact $651M) and **Grand Forks AFB** employ 1,200+ civilians combined. State/local government jobs offer veterans preference. Agriculture, healthcare, and tech sectors actively recruit veterans.

Challenges? **Brutal winters** (January averages 5-17°F), rural isolation in western counties, and limited public transportation. Healthcare access is good but requires driving for specialized care if you're not in Fargo. Housing is affordable (median $280,600) but inventory is tight in Bismarck and Fargo.

Overall verdict: North Dakota excels for **career-focused veterans** in energy, agriculture, or federal employment, and for **student veterans** using GI Bill benefits at UND/NDSU. Healthcare is solid but not exceptional. Best for self-sufficient veterans comfortable with cold weather, rural living, and strong work ethic. Avoid if you need specialized medical care frequently or can't tolerate harsh winters.
