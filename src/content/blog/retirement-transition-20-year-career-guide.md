| Part-time work (optional) | $2,000/month |

## Housing and Relocation

### Stay or Relocate Decision

**Stay (Near Military Base):**

- Medical care nearby
- Familiar environment
- Family/friends nearby

**Relocate to Lower Cost Area:**

- Low-cost area (AR, MS, MO): $25,000/year

**Potential Savings:** Relocating to lower-cost area could add $20-30K annual retirement income equivalent

## Special Considerations for Long-Service Veterans

### Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)

- Provides survivor income to family
- Protects family if you pass early

**Calculate Value:**
- Life insurance alternative

**Recommendation:** Most long-service veterans should convert SBP (financial security for family)

### Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)

**TSP Withdrawal Decisions:**
- Leave in TSP (good investment option)
- Roll to IRA (more investment options)
- Take distribution (taxation implications)

**Taxation:**
- Traditional TSP: Taxable on withdrawal
- Roth TSP: Tax-free withdrawal (if eligible)
- Plan withdrawals strategically

### Social Security (If Applicable)

**Action:** Check with Social Security Administration
