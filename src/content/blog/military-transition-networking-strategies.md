# Networking for Veterans: How to Build Connections That Get You Hired

## Bottom Line Up Front

**70-80% of jobs are filled through networking**, not job postings. Veterans have a massive advantage: the veteran network. Fellow veterans want to help you succeed. But networking requires intentionality—it won't happen by accident. This guide shows you how to build relationships that lead to job opportunities.

## Why Networking Matters

### The Hidden Job Market

Most positions are filled through:
- Internal referrals
- Network connections
- Direct outreach
- Never getting posted publicly

If you're only applying to posted jobs, you're competing with hundreds of applicants for ~20-30% of opportunities.

### Veterans Help Veterans

The veteran community is uniquely supportive:
- Instant common ground
- Shared values and understanding
- Strong desire to help
- Active veteran employee groups at most companies

**Fact:** Veteran employees often get referral bonuses and genuinely want to hire other vets.

## Building Your Network

### Start with Who You Know

**Current contacts:**
- Fellow service members (current and former)
- Chain of command (current and former)
- Military friends at civilian companies
- Family and friends
- Church, community, social connections

**Reach out:**
- Let them know you're transitioning
- Ask about their industry/company
- Request introductions to others

### Expand Through Veteran Organizations

**Veteran-focused networking:**
- American Corporate Partners (ACP)
- Veterati (mentor matching)
- Hire Heroes USA
- Military Officers Association (MOAA)
- Non-Commissioned Officers Association
- VetJobs networking events
- Service branch organizations (Association of the US Army, Navy League, etc.)

**What they offer:**
- Mentorship matching
- Networking events
- Job boards with connections
- Resume and interview help

### Company Veteran Employee Resource Groups

Most large companies have veteran ERGs (Employee Resource Groups):
- Active veteran employees who help with hiring
- Insight into company culture
- Potential referrals
- Some post jobs internally first

**How to connect:**
- Find them on LinkedIn
- Search "[Company] Veterans" on LinkedIn
- Ask for informational interviews

## LinkedIn for Veterans

### Optimize Your Profile

Your LinkedIn profile is your digital first impression:

**Photo:**
- Professional headshot
- No uniform (unless security/government role)
- Friendly, approachable

**Headline:**
Not: "Former Army Staff Sergeant"
Better: "Operations Leader | Logistics Expert | Army Veteran Transitioning to Supply Chain Management"

**Summary:**
- Who you are
- What you've done (in civilian terms)
- What you're looking for
- Call to action (connect with you)

**Experience:**
- Translated military experience
- Accomplishments with metrics
- No military jargon

### Building Connections

**Who to connect with:**
- Veterans in your target industry
- Recruiters in your field
- People at target companies
- Alumni from your military unit
- TAP classmates
- Professional groups in your industry

**How to connect:**
Always include a personalized note:

"Hi [Name], I noticed you served in the Navy and now work in cybersecurity at [Company]. I'm transitioning from the Marines and exploring opportunities in that field. I'd love to connect and learn from your experience. Thanks!"

### Engaging on LinkedIn

**Daily habits:**
- Comment on posts (thoughtfully)
- Share relevant articles
- Post about your transition journey
- Congratulate connections on achievements
- Engage with company content

**This keeps you visible and builds relationships.**

## Informational Interviews

### What They Are

An informational interview is a conversation (not a job interview) where you learn about:
- An industry
- A company
- A career path
- Someone's experience

**Goal:** Build relationships and gather information, NOT ask for a job.

### How to Request One

**LinkedIn message or email:**

"Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], a [rank/branch] veteran transitioning to civilian work. I'm exploring careers in [industry] and noticed your impressive background at [Company].

Would you be willing to share 15-20 minutes for a phone call or coffee? I'd love to hear about your career path and any advice you might have for someone entering the field.

Thank you for considering,
[Your Name]"

**Response rate:** Expect 20-30% to respond. Follow up once if no response.

### What to Ask

**Questions for informational interviews:**
- How did you get into this field?
- What does a typical day look like?
- What skills are most important for success?
- What do you wish you knew when starting out?
- What's the job market like in this field?
- How did your military experience translate?
- What advice do you have for someone like me?
- Who else would you recommend I talk to?

**Don't ask:**
- Can you get me a job?
- Will you refer me?
- Anything that puts them on the spot

### Following Up

After every informational interview:
1. Send thank-you email within 24 hours
2. Connect on LinkedIn if not already
3. Follow any advice they gave
4. Update them on your progress periodically
5. Ask if you can stay in touch

**When appropriate (not during the call):**
"I'm actively looking. If you hear of any opportunities that might be a fit, I'd appreciate you keeping me in mind."

## Networking Events

### Types of Events

### During the Event

- Arrive early (easier to meet people)
- Be approachable (smile, open body language)
- Focus on them, not you
