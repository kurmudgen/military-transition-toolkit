# VA Rating for Migraines and Headaches: Compensation Guide

Chronic migraines and headaches affect nearly 50% of post-9/11 veterans, making them among the most common service-connected disabilities. Yet many veterans don't realize they can receive VA compensation specifically for headaches and migraines—separate from any other conditions. If you experience frequent headaches, migraines with visual disturbances or nausea, or debilitating head pain that interferes with work and daily activities, you likely qualify for disability compensation.

## Understanding Headaches and VA Disability

The VA recognizes two primary categories of headaches:

**Primary Headaches** - Conditions where the headache itself is the disease:
- Migraines (often one-sided, pulsating, lasting 4-72 hours)
- Tension headaches (bilateral, constant pressure sensation)
- Cluster headaches (severe unilateral pain in orbital region)

**Secondary Headaches** - Resulting from other conditions:
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causing post-concussion headaches
- Neck/spine injury (cervicogenic headaches)
- Hypertension-related headaches
- Sleep apnea-related headaches
- PTSD and anxiety-related tension headaches

Veterans develop service-connected headaches through:
- Combat blast injuries or traumatic brain injury
- Motor vehicle accidents during military service
- Whiplash or neck injuries
- Heat injuries or dehydration during training
- Chronic stress from military service
- Concussive events during explosive ordnance disposal

## VA Rating Percentages for Headaches

The VA uses Diagnostic Code 8100 for migraine and 8099 for other headaches, with a five-level rating scale:

**0% (Not Rated)** - Occasional headaches without significant functional impact

**10% Rating** - Occasional migraines with:
- 1-4 migraines or severe headaches monthly
- Mild associated symptoms (minor nausea, sensitivity to light/sound)
- Minimal functional limitation
- Treatable with standard over-the-counter medications

**30% Rating** - Frequent migraines with:
- 4-8 migraines or severe headaches monthly
- Moderate associated symptoms (significant nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity)
- Some impact on work/daily activities
- Requires prescription medication
- Occasional lost work time

**50% Rating** - Severe migraines with:
- 8-15 migraines or severe headaches monthly
- Significant associated symptoms (debilitating nausea, temporary vision loss, photophobia)
- Substantial functional limitation
- Significant impact on employment capability
- Multiple lost work days monthly

**100% Rating** - Totally disabling migraines with:
- More than 15 migraines/severe headaches monthly
- Severe associated symptoms
- Total functional disability (unable to work)
- Usually requires multiple daily medications
- Often supported by TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) status

## Monthly Compensation Amounts

Migraine and headache compensation depends on rating percentage and dependent status. As of 2025:

**10% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $175-$185/month
- With spouse: $195-$210/month
- With child: $210-$230/month

**30% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $330-$350/month
- With spouse: $365-$390/month
- With child: $395-$425/month

**50% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $605-$625/month
- With spouse: $665-$690/month
- With child: $720-$755/month

**100% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $3,737-$3,850/month
- With spouse: $4,095-$4,230/month
- With child: $4,450-$4,600/month

These amounts increase annually with COLA. Your effective date determines your rate, with back pay calculated from when service connection should have begun.

## Evidence Requirements for Headache Claims

### Medical Documentation

**Diagnostic Records:**
- Medical records documenting migraine/headache diagnosis
- Physician diagnosis from VA or civilian provider
- Frequency and severity notes from medical providers
- Dates of onset relative to military service

**Treatment Records:**
- Medication list with prescriptions for migraine treatment
- Emergency room or urgent care visits for severe headaches
- Specialist referrals (neurology, pain management)
- Hospital records if headaches required hospitalization
- Imaging studies (MRI, CT scans) ruling out serious causes

**Headache Diary:**
- Records of migraine frequency, duration, and severity
- Associated symptoms (nausea, light sensitivity, vision changes)
- Triggers (stress, certain foods, sleep changes)
- Functional impact on each occurrence
- Treatment used and effectiveness

**Baseline Military Records:**
- Military medical records mentioning headaches
- Traumatic brain injury documentation (if applicable)
- Combat injury reports
- Service member statements about headaches during service

### Lay Evidence

Strong lay statements from:
- Yourself describing migraine history, triggers, and impact
- Family members witnessing migraine severity and frequency
- Employers documenting work impacts
- Service members who knew you during service

## Nexus Letter Guidance

A nexus letter from a neurologist or primary care provider is critical, establishing connection between military service and current headaches.

### Key Nexus Letter Components

**1. Clear Medical Opinion**
Must state headaches are "at least as likely as not" caused or aggravated by military service.

**2. Service-Related Cause**
Examples include:
- Traumatic brain injury from blast exposure
- Neck/spine injury causing cervicogenic headaches
- Combat-related stress and hypervigilance
- Sleep disturbance from PTSD

**3. Medical Evidence Review**
Reference diagnostic records, imaging results, and treatment history supporting service connection.

**4. Detailed Timeline**
Explain when headaches started relative to military service; if post-service, explain how service caused the condition.

### Quality Nexus Letter Providers

- **VA Neurologists**: Free through VA (may wait months)
- **Private Neurologists**: Board-certified specialists ($400-$800 for letter)
- **Headache Specialists**: Physicians specializing in migraine management
- **VA Service Organizations**: VSOs connect with approved providers
- **Telehealth VA Providers**: Specialized services for veterans ($300-$600)

Strongest nexus letters come from neurologists familiar with military-related TBI and combat stress effects on headache development.

## C&P Exam Preparation

The VA frequently schedules C&P exams for headache claims to assess severity and functional impact.

### Exam Components

**Medical History Review**: Focus on migraine/headache onset, frequency, pattern

**Symptom Description**: Associated symptoms (nausea, vision changes, light sensitivity)

**Functional Assessment**: Impact on work, sleep, social activities

**Physical Examination**: Neurological exam checking reflexes, sensation, coordination

**Mental Status**: Assessment of mood, anxiety, concentration (often affected by chronic pain)

### Questions Typically Asked

- When did migraines/headaches start?
- How often do you experience them per month?
- How long does each headache typically last?
- What's the pain severity on 1-10 scale?
- What medications do you take?
- Do you experience associated symptoms (nausea, vision changes)?
- How do headaches affect work and daily activities?
- Can you function during a migraine?
- Have you missed work due to headaches?
- What triggers your headaches?
- Do you see a neurologist or headache specialist?

### Preparation Tips

- **Keep a Headache Diary**: Log frequency, severity, associated symptoms for 2-3 months pre-exam
- **Bring Medical Records**: Include all neurology notes, imaging results, treatment records
- **Document Triggers**: Be specific about what triggers migraines (stress, lack of sleep, etc.)
- **Describe Functional Impact**: "I miss 2-3 days work monthly" is stronger than "I have bad headaches"
- **Note Medication Response**: Describe which medications help and side effects
- **Mention Specialist Care**: Seeing a neurologist strengthens severity claims
- **Be Detailed on Associated Symptoms**: Don't just mention nausea; describe impact—"vomiting prevents work performance"

The examiner evaluates both objective findings (imaging, neurological exam results) and subjective symptoms (your description of frequency and impact).

## Real Claim Examples

### Case 1: TBI-Related Migraines

A Marine with documented TBI from IED blast filed for service-connected migraines. Evidence included:
- Military traumatic brain injury documentation
- Neurology records from VA showing post-concussion headaches
- Brain imaging (fMRI) revealing TBI sequelae
- Migraine specialist report detailing frequency (12/month) and impact
- Medical nexus letter connecting TBI to chronic migraines

**Outcome**: 50% rating for migraines. Combined with 20% TBI = 60% overall. Monthly compensation: $1,100. Back pay: $18,000 (claim effective from discharge).

### Case 2: Tension Headaches from Combat Stress

A former Army sergeant filed for chronic tension headaches resulting from 8 years military service with multiple deployments. Documentation:
- Primary care physician notes on tension headaches (8-10 per month)
- Medication list with preventive and acute treatments
- Functional limitation notes from employer
- Service-related statement explaining stress-induced headaches

**Outcome**: 30% rating. Monthly compensation: $350. Combined with 10% hearing loss = 19% overall.

### Case 3: Cervicogenic Headaches from Neck Injury

A Navy pilot with documented cervical spine injury filed for resulting headaches. Evidence included:
- Medical records documenting neck injury during service
- MRI showing cervical spine degeneration
- Neurologist assessment of cervicogenic headaches
- PT notes documenting 15 headaches monthly secondary to neck dysfunction

**Outcome**: 50% rating for migraines secondary to neck condition. Combined rating: 60%. Monthly compensation: $825. Effective date: Service injury date.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Insufficient Frequency Documentation
Simply saying "I get frequent headaches" without specific monthly frequency isn't enough.

**Solution**: Keep detailed headache diary for at least 3 months pre-claim, documenting date, frequency, severity, and impact.

### Mistake 2: Weak Service Connection Link
Not explaining how military service caused headaches results in denial.

**Solution**: Provide medical nexus letter explicitly connecting service to current headaches.

### Mistake 3: Missing Specialist Care
Filing without neurologist evaluation weakens high-percentage claims.

**Solution**: See VA or civilian neurologist before filing for 50%+ ratings.

### Mistake 4: Downplaying Functional Impact
"I get migraines" won't justify 50% rating; functional disability information is needed.

**Solution**: Document work absences, ability loss, and specific functional limitations.

### Mistake 5: No Medication Documentation
Failing to list all preventive and acute migraine medications.

**Solution**: Provide complete medication list with prescriptions and treatment changes over time.

## Secondary Conditions Related to Migraines

Veterans with chronic migraines commonly develop secondary conditions:

**Medication Overuse Headache (10-50% rating)** - From frequent acute medication use

**Depression (10-100% rating)** - Chronic pain effects on mental health

**Anxiety (10-100% rating)** - Stress response to chronic migraines

**Sleep Disorder (10-100% rating)** - Headaches disrupting sleep

**Neck/Spine Conditions (10-100% rating)** - If cervicogenic headaches diagnosed

Filing secondary conditions increases total compensation through combined ratings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What headache frequency justifies 50% rating?**
A: Generally 8-15 migraines monthly with significant functional impact. The exact number depends on severity and functional limitation.

**Q: Can I get paid for migraines if they developed after military discharge?**
A: Yes, if they resulted from military service. Post-service development is acceptable if service connection is demonstrated.

**Q: Does the VA require brain imaging for headache claims?**
A: No. Brain imaging helps if available, but claims can succeed with medical testimony and symptom documentation alone.

**Q: What if my migraines are controlled with medication?**
A: You can still receive rating based on the condition's severity and functional impact, even if medication helps.

**Q: Should I file for migraines separately or with other conditions?**
A: File for headaches as a separate condition. They'll be combined with other service-connected disabilities using the VA rating formula.

## Conclusion

Chronic migraines and headaches represent a winnable VA disability category with proper documentation and medical evidence. With a clear diagnosis, detailed frequency records, and a solid nexus letter from a neurologist, approval rates exceed 65%.

Success requires thorough documentation of migraine frequency and functional impact, combined with professional medical opinion connecting your headaches to military service. Start your claim today through VA.gov, your VA Regional Office, or with a veterans' service organization. The earlier you establish your effective date, the more back pay you'll receive.

If initially denied, persistent appeals with improved evidence frequently result in successful approvals. Don't give up—many veterans win headache rating appeals after strengthening their documentation.
