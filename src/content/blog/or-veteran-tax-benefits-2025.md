# Oregon Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Oregon's best veteran tax benefit is having no sales tax—saving $1,500-$2,500 annually compared to neighboring states. For disabled veterans rated 40% or higher, Oregon offers property tax exemptions of $26,303-$31,565 in assessed value (worth $500-$3,000+ annually depending on county tax rates). However, Oregon taxes military retirement income with minimal exemptions, making it one of the worst states nationally for military retirees.

Oregon ranks in the middle tier nationally for veteran tax benefits. The state excels with its zero sales tax and decent property tax exemptions for disabled veterans, but severely underperforms on military retirement income taxation. A 100% disabled veteran with $50,000 military retirement saves approximately $2,000-$4,000 annually compared to Washington state, but pays $2,000-$3,000 more than states that exempt military retirement.

The property tax exemption provides $26,303 in assessed value exemption for non-service-connected disabled veterans, and $31,565 for service-connected disabilities rated 40%+ (2025 amounts). These amounts increase by 3% annually. A disabled veteran in Multnomah County (Portland) saves $2,800-$3,400 annually, while one in Lane County (Eugene) saves $2,400-$2,800.

Downsides? Oregon fully taxes most military retirement income at rates ranging from 4.75% to 9.9%, ranking it last in the nation for supporting military retirees. Only retirement pay earned before October 1, 1991 qualifies for exemption. Additionally, property taxes are generally high in urban areas (Portland averages 1.07% effective rate), though the exemption helps offset this.

Overall verdict: Oregon is good for disabled veterans (40%+ rating) who value zero sales tax and outdoor recreation, but poor for military retirees without significant disability ratings. If maximizing retirement income is your priority, consider Washington, Nevada, or Texas instead.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**40%+ Disabled Veterans (Service-Connected):**
- Exemption: **$31,565 of assessed property value** (2025)
- Requirements: VA disability rating of 40% or higher (service-connected); primary residence in Oregon
- Annual savings: $500-$3,400 depending on county tax rate
- Increases: 3% annually

If you're rated 40% or higher by the VA for service-connected disabilities, you receive a $31,565 reduction in your home's assessed value. Oregon taxes assessed value (not market value), so this directly reduces your tax bill.

**Example:** Portland home with $400,000 assessed value, 1.07% effective rate:
- Without exemption: $4,280/year property tax
- With exemption ($400,000 - $31,565 = $368,435): $3,942/year
- **Annual savings: $338** (for 40% rating)

**Non-Service-Connected Disabled Veterans:**
- Exemption: **$26,303 of assessed property value** (2025)
- Requirements: Any disability rating from military service; primary residence
- Annual savings: $400-$2,800 depending on county
- Increases: 3% annually

Veterans with non-service-connected disabilities or lower ratings still receive $26,303 in assessed value exemption.

**Surviving Spouses:**
- Exemption: Same as veteran's qualification ($26,303 or $31,565)
- Requirements: Unremarried surviving spouse or registered domestic partner
- Duration: Continues as long as spouse remains unmarried and lives in home

**Application Requirements:**
- Must file between January 1 and April 1 to claim exemption for the following tax year (beginning July 1)
- File with county assessor where property is located
- Exemption does NOT automatically transfer between properties—must reapply when moving

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local county assessor** (Multnomah, Washington, Lane, or your county)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
   - VA award letter showing disability rating
   - Proof of Oregon residency (6+ months)
   - Property deed showing ownership

3. **File application with county assessor**
   - Deadline: **April 1** for exemption beginning July 1
   - Processing: 30-60 days
   - Form: Oregon Form 310-676 (Disabled Veteran or Surviving Spouse Property Tax Exemption)

4. **Annual renewal:**
   - Once approved, exemption typically continues automatically
   - Update assessor if disability rating changes or you move

### Property Tax by County

Oregon property taxes vary significantly by county. The state average effective rate is 0.90%, but urban counties run higher:

| County | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Savings (40%+ SC) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Multnomah (Portland) | $500,000 | 1.07% | $5,350 | $338 ($31,565 exemption) |
| Washington (Beaverton, Hillsboro) | $504,300 | 0.93% | $4,690 | $294 |
| Lane (Eugene) | $475,000 | 1.11% | $5,273 | $350 |
| Deschutes (Bend) | $666,206 | 0.85% | $5,663 | $268 |
| Marion (Salem) | $423,498 | 1.02% | $4,320 | $322 |
| Jackson (Medford) | $400,000 | 0.95% | $3,800 | $300 |

**Note:** Savings calculations show reduction from $31,565 exemption applied at county rate. Actual savings vary based on your specific assessed value and local tax district.

**Example:** A 60% service-connected disabled veteran with a $500,000 assessed home in Portland:
- Full tax bill: $5,350
- With $31,565 exemption: $5,012
- **Annual savings: $338**

Over 20 years, that's $6,760 in tax savings (not accounting for increases).

### Municipal Tax Districts

Oregon property taxes include charges from multiple districts (county, city, school, special districts). The exemption applies to the total property tax bill across all districts, not just county taxes.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax rate: **4.75% to 9.9%** (based on income brackets)
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Exemptions: **Only for service before October 1, 1991**
- Annual cost: $1,500-$5,000 compared to states with no income tax

Oregon taxes military retirement income under its standard income tax system. Unlike many states that exempt military retirement, Oregon only allows exemptions for the portion earned before October 1, 1991.

**Oregon Income Tax Brackets (2025):**
- $0-$4,300: 4.75%
- $4,301-$10,750: 6.75%
- $10,751-$125,000: 8.75%
- $125,001+: 9.9%

**Exemption for Pre-1991 Service:**

If you served before October 1, 1991, you can subtract a proportional amount of your federal military pension based on months served before that date:

**Formula:** (Total Months Before Oct 1991 / Total Service Months) × Annual Pension = Exempt Amount

**Example:**
- Total service: 20 years (240 months)
- Service before Oct 1, 1991: 60 months
- Annual pension: $40,000
- Exempt amount: (60/240) × $40,000 = $10,000
- Taxable amount: $30,000
- Tax at 8.75%: $2,625

**Compare to states with full exemption:**
- Washington: $0 (no income tax)
- Nevada: $0 (no income tax)
- Texas: $0 (no income tax)
- **Oregon disadvantage: $2,625/year**

**Example savings for different retirees:**

**O-5 retiree with $60,000 pension (all post-1991 service):**
- Oregon tax: $5,250 (8.75% rate)
- Washington: $0
- **Annual cost of living in Oregon: $5,250**

**E-7 retiree with $35,000 pension (all post-1991 service):**
- Oregon tax: $3,063 (8.75% rate)
- Washington: $0
- **Annual cost: $3,063**

**Legislative Update (2025):**

Senate Bill 519 and House Bill 2050 have been proposed to exempt military retired pay from Oregon state income tax beginning in 2026. As of early 2025, these bills have not passed. Check with the Oregon Department of Revenue for current status.

If enacted, Oregon would join 30+ states that fully exempt military retirement income, significantly improving its ranking for military retirees.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt federally and in all states
- Oregon: Not taxed

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere. This is true in every state and federally.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Oregon taxation: **Taxed as ordinary income** at 4.75-9.9%
- Federal: Also taxed federally
- No special exemption

Surviving spouses receiving Survivor Benefit Plan payments must pay Oregon state income tax on those benefits (unless earned before Oct 1, 1991).

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Subject to Oregon income tax unless on active orders qualifying for exemption
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; Oregon exempts active duty pay for service members stationed outside Oregon
- **Active duty pay:** Oregon exempts active duty pay while serving in Oregon or deployed, under certain conditions (see ORS 316.792)

**Active duty stationed in Oregon:** If you're on active duty orders in Oregon and maintain a home of record in another state, Oregon generally doesn't tax your military pay under SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act).

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: Standard registration fees apply
- Eligibility: Any VA disability rating (even 0%)
- Parking: **Disabled veteran plates do NOT provide disabled parking privileges**
- Note: You must obtain a separate disabled parking placard to park in disabled spaces

Oregon offers permanent "Disabled Veteran" license plates that don't require renewal, available to veterans with any VA disability rating.

**Important:** These plates are decorative/honorary only. They do NOT allow parking in disabled parking spaces.

**Wounded Warrior Disabled Parking Placards:**
- Eligibility: Veterans with 50%+ service-connected disability rating who qualify for disabled parking permit
- Benefit: Legal parking in disabled parking spaces
- Design: Wounded Warrior option available on Oregon disabled parking placards

**Registration Fee Exemptions:**

Oregon does NOT offer vehicle registration fee exemptions for disabled veterans. All veterans pay standard registration fees.

**Driver's License Exemptions:**

Oregon does NOT offer free driver's licenses for disabled veterans. Standard fees apply.

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **0%** (Oregon has no sales tax)
- Vehicle purchases: Tax-free
- Goods and services: Tax-free

Oregon is one of five states with no sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon). This saves veterans and civilians hundreds to thousands annually on purchases.

**Example:** Buying a $40,000 truck:
- In Washington (8.7% sales tax, varies by location): $3,480 tax
- In California (7.25%+ sales tax): $2,900+ tax
- In Oregon: **$0**
- **Savings: $2,900-$3,480**

**Annual savings estimate:**

If you spend $30,000/year on taxable goods:
- Washington (8%): $2,400/year
- California (8%): $2,400/year
- Oregon: $0
- **Annual savings: $2,400**

**Why this matters for veterans:**

The lack of sales tax is Oregon's biggest tax advantage. While military retirees pay income tax, everyone benefits equally from zero sales tax. This is especially valuable for big purchases (vehicles, appliances, electronics, home improvements).

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 40%+ Disabled Property Exemption | Sales Tax | Net Advantage (Military Retiree) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Oregon** | Mostly taxed (4.75-9.9%) | $31,565 assessed value | 0% | Baseline |
| Washington | Exempt (no income tax) | $0 | 6.5-10.4% | +$1,100/year (better for retirees) |
| California | Exempt | Varies by county | 7.25-10.25% | -$500/year (worse) |
| Idaho | Exempt | $1,500 | 6% | +$800/year (better) |
| Nevada | Exempt (no income tax) | $27,144 assessed | 6.85-8.38% | +$1,500/year (better) |

**Verdict:** Oregon ranks **4th out of 5** among West Coast/Mountain states for military retirees. Washington and Nevada are significantly better. Oregon beats California due to no sales tax.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** Bottom tier—one of the worst nationally for taxing military retirement
- **Property tax exemption:** Middle tier—$31,565 exemption is helpful but not exceptional
- **Sales tax:** Top tier—no sales tax is excellent
- **Overall ranking:** **Middle tier** (25-35 out of 50 states)

Oregon ranks poorly for military retirees (40-45th nationally) but better for disabled veterans with property tax exemptions (15-25th nationally).

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- Disabled veterans rated 40%+ (property tax exemption)
- Veterans who make large purchases frequently (no sales tax)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (CA, NY, MA)
- Veterans who value outdoor recreation, progressive culture, and quality of life over tax savings
- Veterans with pre-1991 military service (partial retirement income exemption)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Military retirees with minimal or no disability ratings (full income tax on retirement)
- Military retirees focused primarily on maximizing income (better options: WA, NV, TX, FL)
- Veterans under 40% disabled (smaller property tax exemption, full income tax)

**Better options:**
- **For military retirees:** Washington (no income tax, near Oregon), Nevada, Texas, Florida
- **For 100% disabled veterans:** Texas (full property tax exemption), Oklahoma, South Carolina
- **For balance:** Washington state (no income tax but has sales tax, similar outdoor recreation)

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- Oregon estate tax: **Yes—estates over $1 million**
- Oregon inheritance tax: None
- Veteran exemptions: None

Oregon imposes an estate tax on estates exceeding $1 million (2025). Unlike most states that eliminated estate taxes, Oregon maintains this tax. No special exemptions exist for veterans.

**Impact:** For veterans with significant assets, Oregon's estate tax is a disadvantage. Plan accordingly with estate planning attorney.

### Other Tax Benefits

**No taxes on:**
- Sales/purchases (no sales tax)
- VA disability compensation

**Taxes that exist:**
- Income tax (4.75-9.9%)
- Property tax (average 0.90% effective rate, varies by county)
- Real estate transfer tax (varies by county)
- Estate tax (estates over $1 million)

**Benefits Oregon does offer:**
- No vehicle property tax (unlike Washington)
- No gross receipts taxes

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish Oregon residency and apply for property tax exemption immediately.** File Form 310-676 with your county assessor by April 1 to receive exemption beginning July 1. Don't wait—missing the deadline costs you a full year.

2. **If you have pre-1991 service, calculate your exemption.** Work with a tax professional to determine your exempt portion of military retirement and ensure you're claiming it on Oregon tax returns.

3. **Make major purchases in Oregon to maximize sales tax savings.** Buy vehicles, appliances, and large items here to avoid 6-10% sales tax charged in neighboring states.

4. **If you're 50%+ disabled, obtain a Wounded Warrior disabled parking placard.** Don't rely on disabled veteran license plates—they don't provide parking privileges.

5. **Consider timing of retirement.** If you're retiring from military and haven't yet established residency, compare Oregon to Washington and Nevada. Washington has no income tax and similar outdoor recreation; Nevada has no income tax and lower cost of living.

6. **If you qualify for VA disability, file your claim before moving.** Establishing a 40%+ rating provides the property tax exemption. Work with a VSO to maximize your rating.

7. **Update DFAS withholding for Oregon tax.** Ensure correct state withholding percentage (8-9% for most retirees) to avoid large tax bills in April.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not filing property tax exemption by April 1:** Missing the deadline means paying full property tax for that year. In Portland, that's $338 lost for a 40% disabled veteran.

- **Assuming disabled veteran license plates provide parking privileges:** They don't. You must obtain a separate disabled parking placard.

- **Expecting full military retirement exemption:** Oregon only exempts pre-1991 service. Many veterans are surprised by the income tax bill.

- **Not updating assessor when moving within Oregon:** The exemption doesn't automatically transfer. You must reapply with your new county assessor.

- **Overlooking Washington state as an alternative:** Just across the Columbia River, Vancouver, Washington offers no income tax while providing access to Portland amenities.
