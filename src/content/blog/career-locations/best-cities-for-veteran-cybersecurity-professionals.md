## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. How much does a TS/SCI add to salary?**
Typically $30,000-50,000 over equivalent uncleared positions, more with polygraph.

**2. Can I keep my clearance after leaving the military?**
Yes, if continuously sponsored. You have up to 24 months to be "picked up" by a new sponsor before reinvestigation.

**3. Should I stay near my current base or relocate?**
Consider whether your current area has civilian cyber jobs. D.C., San Antonio, and Columbia offer the most options.

**4. What certifications should I get before separating?**
Security+ meets DoD baseline. Consider CISSP if you have 5+ years experience.

**5. How does military cyber experience translate?**
Directly. Military cyber training (17C, 1B4X1, CTN) is highly valued, especially with clearance.

**6. Are bootcamps worth it for cybersecurity?**
For career changers, yes. VET TEC covers costs without using GI Bill.

**7. What's the job market like for entry-level cyber?**
Competitive but accessible. SOC analyst and junior penetration tester roles are common entry points.

**8. Should I target government or contractors?**
Contractors typically pay more but offer less stability. Government offers job security and retirement benefits.

**9. How important is a degree?**
Less important than certifications and experience in cybersecurity. Many positions require certs but not degrees.

**10. What MOSs/rates translate best to cybersecurity?**
17C (Army Cyber), 1B4X1 (Air Force Cyber), CTN (Navy), and all intelligence MOSs.

**11. Can I do cyber security without a clearance?**
Absolutely. Commercial cybersecurity is huge and pays well without clearance requirements.

**12. What's the career progression in cybersecurity?**
SOC Analyst → Senior Analyst → Team Lead → SOC Manager → CISO, or technical track to Principal Engineer.

**13. Is penetration testing a good career path?**
Yes, but competitive. OSCP certification is essentially required.

**14. How do I transition from IT to cybersecurity?**
Get Security+ certification, pursue SOC analyst roles, build skills through CTFs and home labs.

**15. What's the difference between cleared and commercial cyber?**
Cleared work focuses on government/defense, commercial protects private sector. Pay is comparable, lifestyle differs.

**16. How do geographic requirements work for SCIFs?**
Some SCIFs require living within a certain radius. Clarify this before accepting offers.

**17. Can I work cyber security remotely with a clearance?**
Limited. Secret-level work sometimes allows VPN access. TS/SCI typically requires SCIF.

**18. What should I include on my resume?**
Focus on unclassified achievements, tools used, certifications, and impact metrics.

**19. How do I network in the cybersecurity community?**
Join ISSA, ISACA, attend DEF CON/BSides, participate in CTFs, use LinkedIn.

**20. What's the best path for someone with no cyber experience?**
VET TEC bootcamp → CompTIA Security+ → SOC Analyst role → specialize from there.
