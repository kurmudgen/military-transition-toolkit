## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What IT roles are best for military veterans?**
System administration, network administration, technical support, and IT project management align well with military experience.

**2. Do I need a degree for IT jobs?**
Not necessarily. Certifications often matter more than degrees in IT. Many employers accept experience plus certifications.

**3. What certifications should I get first?**
CompTIA A+ for general IT, Network+ for networking focus, or Security+ if interested in security. These form the foundation.

**4. How does military IT experience translate?**
Directly. Military IT systems often exceed civilian complexity, and your experience with mission-critical systems is highly valued.

**5. Should I start in help desk roles?**
Help desk is a common entry point and provides broad exposure. Don't view it as beneath you—it builds foundational skills.

**6. What's the career progression in IT?**
Help Desk → Desktop Support/Jr. Admin → System Admin → Senior Admin → IT Manager/Architect.

**7. How important is security clearance for IT?**
Valuable in D.C. and near military installations, less important for commercial IT roles in most cities.

**8. Can I work IT remotely?**
Many IT roles offer remote options, especially system administration, cloud roles, and project management. Desktop support typically requires on-site presence.

**9. What military MOSs translate to IT?**
25B (Army IT Specialist), 3D0X2 (Air Force Cyber Systems), IT (Navy Information Systems) translate directly.

**10. Is cloud certification worth it?**
Yes. AWS and Azure certifications significantly boost marketability and salary, especially for mid-career growth.

**11. How long to find an IT job after separation?**
With relevant experience and certifications, typically 1-3 months. Without certs, expect longer as you build credentials.

**12. Should I specialize or stay general?**
Start general to build broad skills, then specialize based on interest. Specialization (cloud, security, network) increases earning potential.

**13. What's the difference between IT and software development?**
IT focuses on maintaining and supporting systems; software development creates new applications. Different skill sets and career paths.

**14. How do I network in IT?**
Join local chapters of CompTIA, ISACA, or user groups. Attend meetups. LinkedIn is essential for IT professionals.

**15. Are IT bootcamps worth it?**
For career changers or specific skill development, yes. VET TEC covers bootcamp costs without using GI Bill.

**16. What soft skills matter in IT?**
Communication, customer service, problem-solving, and patience. Your military leadership experience is an asset.

**17. Should I pursue management or technical track?**
Personal preference. Technical track (architect, engineer) can pay as well as management without people responsibility.

**18. How do VA benefits transfer when relocating?**
VA healthcare transfers immediately—just register at new facility. GI Bill continues at new educational institution.

**19. What if I have no IT experience?**
Start with A+ certification and entry-level help desk roles. Many veterans successfully transition from non-technical MOSs.

**20. How do I explain gaps during transition?**
Frame it positively: "I was completing my military service and preparing for civilian career through certifications and training."
