## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Should I stay near my current base or move to a tech hub?**
It depends on your priorities. Staying near base provides established networks and potentially lower transition stress, but tech hubs offer more opportunities and higher salaries.

**2. How important is my security clearance for software development?**
Extremely valuable in D.C., San Diego, and defense contractor hubs. A TS/SCI can add $20,000-40,000 to base salary in those markets.

**3. Can I work remotely from anywhere?**
Many positions allow remote work, but some companies adjust salary based on location. Research specific employer policies.

**4. What's the best city for a veteran with a family?**
Raleigh-Durham and Dallas-Fort Worth offer the best combination of good schools, affordable housing, and strong job markets.

**5. How long does it take to find a software developer job?**
For veterans with relevant skills, typically 2-4 months. Those transitioning from non-technical roles should expect 4-8 months including training.

**6. Should I complete a coding bootcamp before moving?**
If you don't have coding experience, consider VET TEC or MSSA programs before relocating. You can use them anywhere.

**7. What programming languages are most in demand?**
JavaScript, Python, Java, and TypeScript are most requested. Cloud skills (AWS, Azure, GCP) significantly boost marketability.

**8. Are there veteran-specific hiring programs?**
Yes, nearly every major tech company has veteran hiring initiatives. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce have the most established programs.

**9. How does military experience translate to software development?**
Leadership, problem-solving, working under pressure, and security awareness are highly valued. Technical MOSs (25B, 17C, etc.) provide direct experience.

**10. What if I don't have a computer science degree?**
Tech is increasingly skills-based. Bootcamps, certifications, and demonstrable projects often matter more than degrees.

**11. Should I pursue a degree while transitioning?**
If you have GI Bill remaining, a degree can help long-term career growth, but isn't necessary for entry. Consider part-time while working.

**12. What's the minimum salary I should accept?**
Research market rates for your target city. Entry-level veterans shouldn't accept less than $70,000 in most major metros.

**13. How do I negotiate salary as a veteran?**
Focus on your clearance value, leadership experience, and any certifications. Use sites like Levels.fyi for salary data.

**14. Is it worth moving to San Francisco despite the cost?**
Only if targeting specific companies not available elsewhere or seeking maximum career acceleration. For most, other cities offer better value.

**15. What about smaller cities not on this list?**
Cities like Boise, Nashville, and Austin suburbs offer growing opportunities with lower costs. Remote work makes this increasingly viable.

**16. How do VA benefits transfer when I move?**
VA healthcare transfers immediately—just register at your new facility. Disability continues regardless of location. GI Bill requires updating your school.

**17. Can I keep my clearance if I leave defense work?**
Clearances can be transferred between cleared employers. Without a sponsor, Secret clearances remain valid for 2 years, TS for 2 years (6 months without reinvestigation).

**18. What's the typical career progression in software development?**
Junior Developer (1-3 years) → Mid-level (3-6 years) → Senior (6-10 years) → Staff/Principal or Management track.

**19. Should I join a startup or established company?**
For transitioning veterans, established companies typically offer more structure and mentorship. Consider startups after 2-3 years of experience.

**20. How do I find other veteran developers?**
Join Veterati, American Corporate Partners, and LinkedIn groups like "Veterans in Tech." Most cities have local veteran tech meetups.
