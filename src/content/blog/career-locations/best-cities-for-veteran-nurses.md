**2. What's the best specialty for veterans?**
ICU, ER, and trauma nursing leverage military critical care experience. CRNA offers highest compensation for those pursuing advanced degrees.

**3. How does VA nursing compare to private hospitals?**
VA offers federal benefits, pension, job security, and veteran-focused care. Private hospitals often pay more base salary but may have less benefits.

**5. Can combat medics become RNs?**
Yes, with additional education. Many programs offer accelerated paths for those with military medical experience.

**6. What about travel nursing?**

**7. Is there a nursing shortage?**
Yes, significant. Especially ICU, ER, OR, and rural areas. Experienced nurses are in very high demand.

**8. What's the career path for advancement?**
Staff RN → Charge Nurse → Nurse Manager → Director → CNO. Or clinical path to NP, CRNA, or CNS.

**9. Do unions help nurses?**
Where present (California, Massachusetts, some others), unions provide higher wages, better ratios, and job protection.

**10. How is work-life balance?**
Shift work (3x12 common) offers flexibility. However, mandatory overtime and short staffing can impact balance.
