# VA Disability Rating for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 8045** with a complex system evaluating **10 facets of cognitive, emotional, and physical function**. The highest facet rating determines your overall TBI rating. Many veterans receive **10-40%** for mild TBI, but moderate-severe TBI can rate **70-100%**. Critically, TBI residuals (headaches, PTSD, vision problems, etc.) are often rated **separately**, so your total combined rating can be much higher. Blast exposure from IEDs is the most common cause in recent veterans. Claims typically take 6-12 months due to complexity.

## What Is TBI and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Traumatic Brain Injury occurs when an external force causes brain dysfunction. Severity ranges from mild (concussion) to severe (penetrating injury).

**Severity Classifications:**

**Mild TBI (Concussion):**
- Loss of consciousness < 30 minutes
- Alteration of consciousness/mental state
- Post-traumatic amnesia < 24 hours
- Normal structural imaging

**Moderate TBI:**
- Loss of consciousness 30 minutes to 24 hours
- Post-traumatic amnesia 1-7 days

**Severe TBI:**
- Loss of consciousness > 24 hours
- Post-traumatic amnesia > 7 days
- Abnormal imaging

**Common military causes:**

- **Blast exposure**: IEDs, mortars, rockets, grenades (most common in recent conflicts)
- **Vehicle accidents**: Rollovers, crashes, helicopter accidents
- **Falls**: From height, training accidents
- **Direct impact**: Struck by objects, sports injuries, combatives
- **Penetrating injuries**: Gunshot, shrapnel

**Symptoms of TBI residuals:**
- Headaches/migraines
- Memory problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Dizziness/balance problems
- Vision changes
- Hearing issues/tinnitus
- Mood changes (irritability, depression, anxiety)
- Sleep disturbances
- Fatigue
- Sensitivity to light and sound
- Cognitive slowing

## VA Rating Criteria for TBI

TBI is rated under **38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045** using a unique system that evaluates **10 facets** of brain function.

### The 10 Facets

Each facet is rated 0, 1, 2, 3, or "total." Your overall TBI rating is determined by your **highest facet level**:

| Highest Facet Level | TBI Rating |
|---------------------|------------|
| 0 | 0% |
| 1 | 10% |
| 2 | 40% |
| 3 | 70% |
| Total | 100% |

### The 10 Facets Explained

**1. Memory, Attention, Concentration, Executive Functions**
- 0: No complaints
- 1: Mild memory loss, difficulty following complex commands
- 2: Moderate memory loss, difficulty with highly complex work
- 3: Severe memory loss, inability to perform former work
- Total: Complete inability to function

**2. Judgment**
- 0: Normal
- 1: Mildly impaired (has difficulty with complex financial decisions)
- 2: Moderately impaired (has difficulty with safety awareness)
- 3: Severely impaired (total inability to make reasonable decisions)

**3. Social Interaction**
- 0: Normal
- 1: Occasionally inappropriate
- 2: Frequently inappropriate
- 3: Inappropriate most of the time
- Total: Totally inappropriate behavior

**4. Orientation**
- 0: Normal
- 1: Occasionally disoriented to one aspect (time, place, person, situation)
- 2: Occasionally disoriented to two aspects, or frequently disoriented to one
- 3: Frequently disoriented to two or more aspects

**5. Motor Activity (with intact motor and sensory system)**
- 0: Normal
- 1: Mild interference with normal activities
- 2: Moderate interference
- 3: Motor activity severely limited
- Total: Unable to perform motor activities

**6. Visual Spatial Orientation**
- 0: Normal
- 1: Mildly impaired (gets lost in unfamiliar areas)
- 2: Moderately impaired (gets lost in familiar areas)
- 3: Severely impaired (cannot recognize familiar people)

**7. Subjective Symptoms**
- 0: No symptoms
- 1: Mild symptoms that don't interfere with work
- 2: Moderate symptoms that occasionally interfere with work
- 3: Severe symptoms that frequently interfere
- Subjective symptoms rated under appropriate code if not part of TBI

**8. Neurobehavioral Effects**
- 0: None
- 1: Mild effects that occasionally interfere with interpersonal relations
- 2: Moderate effects that frequently interfere
- 3: Severe effects that interfere most of time

**9. Communication**
- 0: Normal
- 1: Comprehension or expression slightly impaired
- 2: Inability to communicate at simple levels occasionally
- 3: Inability to communicate at simple levels most of time
- Total: Unable to communicate

**10. Consciousness**
- Total: Persistently altered state of consciousness

### Separately Rated Residuals

**Critical:** Many TBI symptoms are rated **separately** under their own diagnostic codes, not as part of the TBI rating:

- **Headaches/Migraines**: DC 8100 (0-50%)
- **Mental health conditions**: PTSD (DC 9411), Depression (DC 9434), etc. (0-100%)
- **Vision problems**: Various DCs
- **Hearing loss**: DC 6100
- **Tinnitus**: DC 6260 (10%)
- **Vestibular disorders**: DC 6204
- **Motor/sensory deficits**: Various DCs
- **Seizures**: DC 8910-8914

**You should claim TBI AND all residual conditions separately to maximize your combined rating.**

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**Document the TBI event:**
- Service treatment records showing head injury
- Medical evacuation records
- Line of duty determination
- Emergency room or field treatment records
- Post-deployment health assessments
- Neuroimaging (CT, MRI) from service

**Blast exposure documentation:**
- Combat action records
- Unit records of IED attacks
- Witness statements
- Award citations mentioning blast exposure
- After-action reports

**Even "mild" TBI counts:**
Many veterans didn't realize they had TBI at the time. Document any:
- Being "dazed" or "seeing stars"
- Headaches after blast/impact
- Brief loss of consciousness
- Confusion or disorientation
- Memory gaps around event

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **TBI evaluation** (specific to TBI, not just general mental health)
2. **Neuropsychological testing** (documents cognitive deficits)
3. **Current imaging** if abnormalities exist
4. **Documentation of residual symptoms**

### Severity Evidence

- Ongoing treatment records
- Cognitive test results
- Functional limitations
- Work history showing decline
- Relationship impacts

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

TBI C&P exams are comprehensive and may take several hours.

**The examiner will evaluate:**
1. History of TBI event(s)
2. All 10 facets of function
3. Current symptoms and residuals
4. Functional impairment

**What happens:**
- Detailed history of TBI event(s)
- Cognitive testing (memory, attention, processing)
- Physical examination
- Review of symptoms
- Assessment of each facet

**What to tell them:**

1. **Describe ALL TBI events**, even mild ones
2. **Describe current symptoms in detail**
3. **Explain functional impact**: "I can't remember appointments without my phone"
4. **Don't minimize**: "good days" don't negate your difficulties
5. **Bring someone who knows you**: They can describe changes they've observed

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgetting to mention blast exposures
- Not describing how symptoms affect daily life
- Testing well on a "good day" without explaining variability
- Not claiming residuals separately

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With TBI

TBI causes or contributes to numerous conditions—**claim these separately**:

1. **Headaches/Migraines** - DC 8100 (0-50%)
2. **PTSD** - DC 9411 (0-100%)
3. **Depression** - DC 9434 (0-100%)
4. **Anxiety** - DC 9400 (0-100%)
5. **Sleep Apnea** - DC 6847 (0-100%)
6. **Tinnitus** - DC 6260 (10%)
7. **Hearing Loss** - DC 6100 (0-100%)
8. **Vertigo/Dizziness** - DC 6204 (0-100%)
9. **Vision Problems** - Various DCs
10. **Cognitive Disorder** - DC 9326 (if separate from TBI rating)
11. **Seizures** - DC 8910-8914 (if applicable)
12. **Erectile Dysfunction** - DC 7522

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied

### 1. "No documented TBI event"
**Why it happens:** No records of specific injury
**How to avoid:**
- Submit buddy statements describing event
- Cite blast exposures documented in unit records
- Note any post-deployment health assessment mentions

### 2. "Current symptoms not related to TBI"
**Why it happens:** Examiner attributes symptoms to other causes
**How to avoid:**
- Get private neuropsychological evaluation
- Establish timeline showing symptoms began after TBI

### 3. "TBI residuals rated under other codes"
**How to understand:** This isn't denial—your residuals (headaches, PTSD) may be rated separately. Check your total combined rating.

## Appeal Strategies

**Supplemental Claim with:**
- Neuropsychological evaluation
- Private neurology opinion
- Buddy statements about blast exposure
- Updated residual condition claims

**Important:** If your TBI rating seems low, check if residuals are being rated separately. Your combined rating may be appropriate even if the TBI rating alone is low.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I had a concussion but didn't report it. Can I still claim TBI?
Yes. Many service members didn't report "minor" head injuries. Document the event through buddy statements and describe ongoing symptoms.

### What if I had multiple blast exposures?
Each exposure can contribute to cumulative brain injury. Document all exposures, even if you felt "fine" afterward.

### How does TBI interact with PTSD?
TBI and PTSD often co-occur but are rated separately. The emotional/behavioral symptoms are separated—some under TBI facets, others under the mental health rating.

### What if my imaging is normal?
Normal imaging doesn't preclude TBI diagnosis, especially for mild TBI. Functional impairment is what matters for rating.

### Should I claim TBI or just the individual residuals?
Claim both. The TBI provides the nexus for residuals. Having TBI service-connected makes it easier to claim secondary conditions.
