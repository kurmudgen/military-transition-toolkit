# Best Cities for Veterans in Vermont 2025: Cost of Living & Benefits

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Burlington ranks #1 for Vermont veterans seeking maximum benefits ($40,000 property tax exemption), urban amenities, and employment (968 veterans, median home $442K, 30% higher cost of living), but Rutland (#2) offers better affordability (median home $258K, lowest cost of living in VT) while maintaining solid benefits ($20,000 exemption) and VA clinic access. Montpelier (#3) provides small-town capital charm with moderate costs (median home $461K but lower property taxes than Burlington). Brattleboro, South Burlington, Bennington, and Winooski round out the top 7 based on proximity to VA facilities, veteran-specific benefits, employment, and quality of life. Every city on this list offers access to VA healthcare within 30 minutes and minimum $10,000 property tax exemptions—your choice depends on whether you prioritize maximum benefits (Burlington/South Burlington), affordability (Rutland/Brattleboro), or small-town community (Montpelier/Bennington/Winooski).

## Ranking Methodology

I evaluated Vermont's cities on seven key factors critical to veteran quality of life:

1. **Veteran-Specific Benefits:** Property tax exemption amounts ($10,000-$40,000), proximity to VA facilities
2. **Veteran Population:** Number of veterans and percentage of population (community and resources)
3. **Housing Costs:** Median home prices, rental rates, property tax rates
4. **Employment:** Unemployment rates, major employers, veteran hiring programs
5. **Healthcare Access:** Distance to VA Medical Center or CBOCs, quality of non-VA healthcare
6. **Quality of Life:** Safety, education, recreation, amenities, veteran community
7. **Overall Affordability:** Cost of living index compared to national and Vermont averages

Each city receives honest pros AND cons—no sugar-coating. Your mission is to find the right fit for your priorities and budget.

## #1: Burlington - Maximum Benefits, Urban Amenities, Higher Costs

**Overall Score: 9.2/10**

**Veteran Population:** 968 veterans (±199), representing 2.4% of total population
**Total Population:** 44,432 (largest city in Vermont)
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $442,000
**Median Rent:** $1,351/month (single person)
**Property Tax Rate (FY 2024):** Homestead education $1.4485 per $100, Municipal $0.7523 per $100
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $40,000 (maximum)
**Cost of Living Index:** 133% of U.S. national average (33% higher)
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 2.5-3.0%

### Why Burlington Ranks #1

**Maximum property tax exemption:** Burlington voted to provide the full $40,000 property tax exemption permitted under state law—the highest benefit level in Vermont. For a veteran with a $400,000 home, this saves approximately $880 annually ($17,600 over 20 years).

**VA healthcare access:** Burlington-Lakeside CBOC at 128 Lakeside Avenue provides primary care, mental health, laboratory, and telehealth services. This is Vermont's largest CBOC, serving Chittenden County's large veteran population. The main VA Medical Center in White River Junction is 1 hour 15 minutes away (65 miles).

**Education hub:** Burlington houses the University of Vermont (premier Vermont university with strong veteran support), Champlain College (excellent tech/cybersecurity programs), and easy access to Community College of Vermont. Veterans using GI Bill receive in-state tuition at all three, plus UVM's unlimited Yellow Ribbon for undergrads.

**Employment opportunities:** Burlington and surrounding Chittenden County represent Vermont's strongest job market:
- University of Vermont Medical Center (state's largest employer, 8,500+ employees)
- GlobalFoundries semiconductor facility in Essex Junction (1,500+ employees, actively hiring veterans)
- Burlington International Airport (security, maintenance, operations—veteran-friendly)
- Numerous tech startups and small businesses
- Tourism and hospitality (ski industry, Lake Champlain resorts)

**Outdoor recreation:** Lake Champlain waterfront, Burlington Bike Path (8 miles of lakeside trail), nearby Green Mountains for hiking/skiing, vibrant downtown Church Street Marketplace.

**Veteran community:** With nearly 1,000 veterans in Burlington proper and 10,458 in the broader metro area, you'll find active VFW and American Legion posts, student veteran organizations at UVM, and regular veteran meetups.

### The Honest Cons

**Expensive:** Burlington's cost of living is 33% higher than the national average and the highest in Vermont. Median home price of $442,000 exceeds the state average ($421,400), and rental costs ($1,351/month) strain single-income budgets. Even with the $40,000 property tax exemption, veterans on fixed incomes may struggle with overall costs.

**Property taxes remain high even with exemption:** Despite the $40,000 exemption, Burlington's combined tax rate (education + municipal) means you'll still pay $7,923 annually on a $400,000 home after exemption—versus $5,800 for a similar home in Rutland.

**Traffic and congestion:** By Vermont standards, Burlington feels crowded. Limited parking downtown, traffic bottlenecks during rush hour and ski season, and population density far exceeding other Vermont cities.

**Housing shortage:** High demand and limited inventory make house-hunting competitive. Expect bidding wars and above-asking offers. Rental vacancy rates hover around 2%, making apartments hard to find.

**Liberal politics may not suit all:** Burlington leans heavily progressive—Bernie Sanders was Burlington mayor for 8 years. If you prefer conservative politics or small-government philosophy, Burlington's political culture might not fit.

**Distance to main VA facility:** While the Burlington CBOC handles most routine care, complex cases, surgeries, and specialty appointments require a 75-minute drive to White River Junction. Winter weather can make this trip challenging.

### Best For

- Veterans prioritizing maximum property tax savings
- Those seeking urban amenities, restaurants, cultural events
- Veterans with families wanting excellent public schools (Burlington School District is strong)
- College-bound veterans using GI Bill at UVM
- Veterans transitioning into tech, healthcare, or professional careers
- Those comfortable with higher cost of living in exchange for job opportunities

### Sample Monthly Budget for Single Veteran in Burlington

**Income:**
- VA disability 70%: $1,716
- Part-time job (20 hrs/wk at $18/hr): $1,440
- **Total: $3,156**

**Expenses:**
- Rent (1-bedroom apartment): $1,350
- Utilities: $150
- Food: $400
- Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas): $450
- Internet/phone: $100
- Healthcare copays: $50
- Entertainment/misc: $300
- **Total: $2,800**

**Surplus: $356** (sufficient for emergencies and savings)

**Verdict:** Burlington works for veterans with moderate income or dual-income households, but tight for those on VA disability alone without additional income.

---

## #2: Rutland - Best Affordability, Solid Benefits, Small-City Feel

**Overall Score: 8.9/10**

**Veteran Population:** Estimated 450-550 veterans (approximately 3.5% of population)
**Total Population:** 15,807 (third-largest city in Vermont)
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $258,267
**Median Rent:** $1,150/month
**Property Tax Rate (estimated):** Combined approximately $2.30 per $100
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $20,000 (enhanced above state minimum)
**Cost of Living Index:** 90.1% of U.S. national average (9.9% cheaper than national average)
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 3.0-3.5%

### Why Rutland Ranks #2

**Unbeatable affordability:** Rutland is Vermont's cheapest major city. Median home price of $258,267 is 42% less than Burlington and 39% below the Vermont state median. This makes homeownership achievable for veterans on VA disability or modest retirement incomes.

**Solid property tax benefits:** Rutland voted to provide $20,000 property tax exemption—double the state minimum and competitive with most Vermont cities. Combined with lower property values and moderate tax rates, veterans pay significantly less in annual property taxes than Burlington peers with equivalent disability ratings.

**VA clinic on-site:** Rutland CBOC at 232 West Street provides primary care, mental health services, laboratory, and telehealth. No need to drive to Burlington or White River Junction for routine appointments. Complex care requires 90-minute drive to White River Junction (68 miles).

**Central Vermont location:** Rutland sits at Vermont's geographic center, making it easy to reach other parts of the state. Killington and Pico ski resorts are 20 minutes away (winter employment), and Rutland provides a convenient base for exploring all of Vermont.

**Small-city benefits without rural isolation:** Rutland offers city services (hospital, schools, shopping, restaurants) without Burlington's congestion. You'll find chain stores (Walmart, Home Depot, Target) and local businesses, providing options without overwhelming choice.

**Regional Medical Center:** Rutland Regional Medical Center is a quality hospital for non-VA healthcare needs, employing 1,500+ and providing employment opportunities for veteran spouses.

**Active veteran community:** Multiple VFW and American Legion posts, regular veteran events, and strong community support for veterans. Rutland's smaller size means veterans often know each other and build tight-knit communities.

### The Honest Cons

**Limited employment diversity:** Rutland's economy is anchored by healthcare, tourism, and retail—solid sectors but lacking the diversity and high-wage jobs of Burlington. Tech and professional positions are scarce. Median household income ($47,000) is lower than Vermont average ($68,800).

**Economic struggles:** Rutland has faced economic challenges as manufacturing declined. While recovering, poverty rates exceed state averages, and downtown has struggled with empty storefronts (though revitalization efforts are underway).

**Opioid crisis impact:** Rutland was hit hard by the opioid epidemic. While the situation has improved, substance abuse rates remain higher than Vermont averages, affecting community safety perceptions.

**Limited cultural amenities:** Compared to Burlington, Rutland has fewer restaurants, cultural events, music venues, and entertainment options. If you want diverse dining or regular concerts, you'll drive to Burlington.

**Colder and snowier:** Rutland's inland location means colder winters and more snow than Burlington (which benefits from Lake Champlain's moderating effect). Expect temperatures 5-10°F colder and 20-30 more inches of snow annually.

**Lower home appreciation:** Rutland's slower economy means home values appreciate more slowly than Burlington or Montpelier. This improves affordability but limits wealth-building through real estate.

### Best For

- Budget-conscious veterans prioritizing affordability
- Retirees on fixed incomes (VA disability, military retirement)
- Veterans seeking small-city community feel
- Outdoor enthusiasts (skiing, hiking, hunting, fishing all nearby)
- Veterans comfortable with blue-collar economy
- Those wanting to own a home without mortgage stress

### Sample Monthly Budget for Single Veteran in Rutland

**Income:**
- VA disability 70%: $1,716
- Part-time seasonal work (ski resort): $800 (winter months)
- **Total: $2,516**

**Expenses:**
- Rent (1-bedroom apartment): $1,150
- Utilities: $130
- Food: $350
- Transportation: $400
- Internet/phone: $90
- Healthcare copays: $40
- Entertainment/misc: $250
- **Total: $2,410**

**Surplus: $106** (adequate, though tight)

**Verdict:** Rutland works well for veterans on VA disability alone, particularly if you purchase a home (mortgage payment potentially lower than rent). Much more budget-friendly than Burlington.

---

## #3: Montpelier - Capital City Charm, Moderate Costs, Government Jobs

**Overall Score: 8.7/10**

**Veteran Population:** 231 veterans (±76), approximately 3.5% of population
**Total Population:** 7,855 (smallest state capital in the U.S.)
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $461,000
**Median Rent:** $1,022/month
**Property Tax Rate:** Municipal approximately $0.90 per $100; education varies
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $20,000 (enhanced above state minimum)
**Cost of Living Index:** Approximately 105-110% of U.S. national average (5-10% above average)
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 2.5-3.0%

### Why Montpelier Ranks #3

**State government employment:** Montpelier is Vermont's capital, and state government is the dominant employer. Veterans receive 5-point hiring preference (10 points if disabled) for state positions, giving competitive advantage. Many state jobs offer good benefits, pension plans, and stability.

**Small-town feel with city amenities:** Montpelier is America's smallest state capital (population under 8,000), providing intimate community while offering restaurants, cafes, independent shops, and cultural events (Vermont College of Fine Arts, Lost Nation Theater, farmer's market).

**Enhanced property tax exemption:** $20,000 exemption (like Rutland) significantly reduces property tax burden. Combined with Montpelier's status as capital, veterans enjoy good benefits in a unique setting.

**Access to services:** Despite small size, Montpelier has hospital (Central Vermont Medical Center in nearby Berlin), VA services through community providers, and all essential city services.

**Highly educated population:** High concentration of state workers, college faculty, and professionals creates intellectually stimulating environment. Strong public schools and community emphasis on education.

**Walkable downtown:** Montpelier's compact downtown is extremely walkable—you can easily live car-light or car-free if desired, saving significantly on transportation costs.

**Proximity to recreation:** Surrounded by Green Mountains. Hiking, mountain biking, and skiing are 15-30 minutes away. Montpelier is a hub for outdoor enthusiasts.

### The Honest Cons

**Highest median home price in our rankings:** At $461,000, Montpelier's median home price exceeds even Burlington ($442,000). This reflects limited housing stock, high demand, and wealthy residents (state officials, professionals). Entry-level homes under $300,000 are rare.

**Very limited inventory:** With only 7,855 residents, housing turnover is minimal. You might search for months to find suitable homes for sale. Rental market is similarly tight.

**Higher property tax rates:** Despite the $20,000 exemption, Montpelier's property tax rates are among Vermont's highest. Washington County (which includes Montpelier) has median annual property taxes of $5,478—third-highest in Vermont.

**Limited diversity of employment:** State government dominates. If you don't work for the state or in supporting services (legal, consulting, nonprofits), job options are limited. Private sector opportunities are scarce.

**Flood risk:** Montpelier sits at the confluence of the Winooski and North Branch rivers. The city experienced devastating flooding in July 2023 (remnants of Hurricane Beryl), with downtown underwater. Flood insurance is essential, and climate change increases future flood risk.

**Distance from VA facilities:** No CBOC in Montpelier. Burlington CBOC is 40 minutes away; White River Junction VA is 45 minutes. Routine care requires regular drives.

**Political culture:** As the capital, Montpelier is politically engaged and leans progressive. If you prefer to avoid politics or hold conservative views, the constant political atmosphere might feel overwhelming.

### Best For

- Veterans seeking state government jobs with hiring preference
- Educated veterans who value intellectual community
- Small-town lovers who want walkability and charm
- Veterans with higher incomes who can afford $400K+ homes
- Those who enjoy outdoor recreation (hiking, skiing, mountain biking)
- Veterans who prefer civically engaged, politically aware community

### Sample Monthly Budget for Single Veteran in Montpelier

**Income:**
- Military retirement (E-7, 20 years): $2,500
- State government job (part-time): $1,800
- **Total: $4,300**

**Expenses:**
- Rent (1-bedroom apartment): $1,020
- Utilities: $140
- Food: $380
- Transportation: $300 (walkable downtown reduces costs)
- Internet/phone: $95
- Healthcare copays: $50
- Entertainment/misc: $350
- **Total: $2,335**

**Surplus: $1,965** (excellent financial position)

**Verdict:** Montpelier works best for veterans with dual income or solid retirement pay. Difficult for those on VA disability alone due to high housing costs.

## #4: Brattleboro - Artsy Southern Vermont, Moderate Costs, Strong Healthcare

**Overall Score: 8.5/10**

**Veteran Population:** Estimated 350-450 veterans
**Total Population:** 12,184
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $325,905
**Average Household Income:** $46,972
**Property Tax Rate:** Combined approximately $2.24 per $100
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $15,000 (enhanced above state minimum)
**Cost of Living Index:** 99.7% of U.S. national average (essentially at national average)
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 3.0-3.5%

### Why Brattleboro Ranks #4

**On-site VA clinic:** Brattleboro CBOC at 71 GSP Drive provides primary care, mental health, lab services, and telehealth, eliminating need for long drives for routine care. Complex care requires 2-hour drive to White River Junction (130 miles).

**Arts and culture:** Brattleboro has thriving arts scene—galleries, independent bookstores, Latchis Theatre (historic art deco movie palace), Brattleboro Museum & Art Center. If you appreciate culture, Brattleboro rivals Burlington while staying affordable.

**Moderate housing costs:** Median home price ($325,905) sits comfortably in the middle of Vermont prices—more affordable than Burlington/Montpelier, less cheap than Rutland. This sweet spot makes homeownership accessible without sacrificing quality.

**Healthcare excellence:** Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is a high-quality community hospital (often ranked among Vermont's best). Combined with the VA CBOC, veterans have excellent healthcare access.

**Southern Vermont location:** Close to Massachusetts border, providing easy access to larger cities (Greenfield MA, Northampton MA) for shopping, entertainment, and employment. Also convenient to New Hampshire and Connecticut.

**Progressive community:** Brattleboro attracts artists, writers, and free-thinkers. If you value diversity of thought, alternative lifestyles, and progressive politics, you'll find like-minded community.

**Food co-op culture:** Brattleboro Food Co-op is legendary in Vermont, offering organic and local foods, community events, and gathering space. Great for health-conscious veterans.

### The Honest Cons

**Distance from VA Medical Center:** Brattleboro is Vermont's southernmost city, making White River Junction a 2-hour drive (130 miles). Specialty care, surgeries, and complex cases require significant travel. Consider whether this is manageable for your healthcare needs.

**Limited employment:** Brattleboro's economy is small and focused on healthcare, education, tourism, and retail. Private sector jobs, especially high-wage positions, are limited. Many residents commute to Massachusetts for work.

**Smaller veteran community:** With an estimated 350-450 veterans (vs. Burlington's 968), the veteran community is smaller and less visible. Veterans seeking large, active VSO posts might feel isolated.

**Economic inequality:** Brattleboro has visible income inequality—affluent professionals alongside struggling residents. Downtown has pockets of poverty and some social challenges (homelessness, substance abuse).

**Remote location:** Southern Vermont feels isolated from the rest of the state. Burlington is 2.5 hours away. You're closer to Massachusetts cities than Vermont cities, which can feel disconnected from state resources.

**Aging infrastructure:** Some Brattleboro neighborhoods have older housing stock requiring maintenance and updates. Factor in potential renovation costs when budgeting for home purchase.

### Best For

- Art-loving, culturally minded veterans
- Those seeking small-city charm with reasonable affordability
- Veterans who value proximity to VA clinic over main medical center
- Progressive-leaning veterans comfortable in alternative community
- Veterans willing to commute to Massachusetts for higher-wage jobs
- Outdoor enthusiasts (nearby hiking, skiing at Mount Snow)

### Sample Monthly Budget for Single Veteran in Brattleboro

**Income:**
- VA disability 100%: $3,737
- **Total: $3,737**

**Expenses:**
- Rent (1-bedroom apartment): $1,100
- Utilities: $130
- Food: $370
- Transportation: $420
- Internet/phone: $90
- Healthcare copays: $0 (100% disabled = no copays)
- Entertainment/misc: $300
- **Total: $2,410**

**Surplus: $1,327** (strong financial position)

**Verdict:** Brattleboro works well for veterans on VA disability, particularly those rated 70%+. Affordability and CBOC access make it manageable on fixed income.

## #5: South Burlington - Burlington Benefits Without Downtown Density

**Overall Score: 8.4/10**

**Veteran Population:** Estimated 600-750 veterans (metro data includes South Burlington)
**Total Population:** 21,713
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $420,000-450,000 (estimated, similar to Burlington)
**Median Rent:** $1,300-1,400/month
**Property Tax Rate:** Similar to Burlington (municipal + education combined)
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $40,000 (maximum)
**Cost of Living Index:** 130-135% of U.S. national average (30-35% above average)
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 2.5-3.0%

### Why South Burlington Ranks #5

**Maximum property tax exemption:** Like Burlington, South Burlington offers the full $40,000 exemption—Vermont's highest benefit level.

**Suburban living, city access:** South Burlington provides suburban neighborhoods, larger lots, and quieter streets while maintaining immediate access to Burlington's employment, culture, and amenities. Many consider it "Burlington without the hassles."

**Excellent schools:** South Burlington School District consistently ranks among Vermont's best public schools—ideal for veterans with children.

**Employment hub:** South Burlington houses University of Vermont Medical Center's main campus, Burlington International Airport, numerous retail centers (Healthy Living, shopping plazas), and corporate offices (Burton Snowboards headquarters is nearby).

**Burlington CBOC access:** Burlington-Lakeside CBOC at 128 Lakeside Avenue is 10-15 minutes from anywhere in South Burlington, providing convenient VA healthcare access.

**More affordable than downtown Burlington:** While still expensive, South Burlington offers slightly more affordable housing than downtown Burlington, with more single-family homes and yards.

**New housing development:** South Burlington led Chittenden County with 422 new apartment units completed in 2024, increasing housing availability (though demand remains high).

### The Honest Cons

**Car-dependent:** Unlike walkable Burlington, South Burlington requires a car for nearly everything—grocery shopping, restaurants, healthcare, errands. Factor transportation costs into budget.

**Suburban sprawl:** South Burlington epitomizes suburban development—strip malls, big-box stores, and subdivisions. If you want walkable neighborhoods and historic charm, South Burlington disappoints.

**Property taxes remain high:** Even with $40,000 exemption, property taxes on $420,000 home exceed $8,000 annually. Combined with higher home prices, housing costs strain budgets.

**Less community character:** South Burlington feels more generic than Burlington's distinctive neighborhoods. Harder to develop sense of community in suburban environment.

**Limited public transit:** Green Mountain Transit serves South Burlington, but routes are limited and infrequent compared to Burlington proper. Car ownership is essential.

**Still expensive:** Cost of living is only marginally lower than Burlington—you save a bit on housing, but overall expenses remain 30%+ above national average.

### Best For

- Veterans with families prioritizing top-rated schools
- Those wanting Burlington benefits without downtown density
- Veterans employed at UVM Medical Center or Burlington Airport
- Suburban-lifestyle preference with yard and quiet streets
- Veterans who value maximum property tax exemption ($40,000)

### Sample Monthly Budget for Family of Four in South Burlington

**Income:**
- Military retirement (O-3, 20 years): $3,800
- Spouse employment (full-time): $3,500
- **Total: $7,300**

**Expenses:**
- Mortgage (15-year on $350,000 home): $2,100
- Utilities: $250
- Food: $900
- Transportation (2 cars): $700
- Internet/phone: $150
- Healthcare/insurance: $400
- Kids activities/misc: $500
- **Total: $5,000**

**Surplus: $2,300** (strong position with dual income)

**Verdict:** South Burlington works well for dual-income military families. Challenging for single veterans or single-income households.

## #6: Bennington - Southwest Vermont Hub, Adjacent to Veterans' Home

**Overall Score: 8.2/10**

**Veteran Population:** Estimated 450-550 veterans
**Total Population:** 15,333
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $280,000-310,000 (estimated)
**Property Tax Rate:** Combined approximately $2.28 per $100
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $15,000 (enhanced above state minimum)
**Cost of Living Index:** Approximately 95-100% of U.S. national average
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 3.0-3.5%

### Why Bennington Ranks #6

**Home of Vermont State Veterans' Home:** The Vermont State Veterans' Home (177-bed nursing facility) is located at 325 North Street, Bennington. Veterans and families appreciate proximity to this long-term care resource. The presence of the Veterans' Home creates strong community support for veterans.

**Bennington CBOC adjacent to Veterans' Home:** Bennington CBOC at 186 North Street sits directly next to the Veterans' Home, providing convenient primary care, mental health, lab services, and telehealth.

**Southwestern Vermont regional hub:** Bennington is the largest city in southwestern Vermont, serving as the regional center for shopping, healthcare, and services. Bennington College (private liberal arts) and Vermont Technical College (branch campus) provide education options.

**Affordable housing:** Median home prices around $280,000-310,000 make Bennington significantly more affordable than Burlington, Montpelier, or South Burlington, though less cheap than Rutland.

**Proximity to New York and Massachusetts:** Bennington sits near New York border (Albany 45 minutes) and Massachusetts border (Williamstown 15 minutes), providing access to larger cities for employment, entertainment, and shopping.

**Historic charm:** Bennington has rich Revolutionary War history (Battle of Bennington, Bennington Battle Monument), historic downtown, and classic New England architecture.

**Active veteran community:** Strong VFW and American Legion presence, regular veteran events, and community strongly supports veterans due to Veterans' Home presence.

### The Honest Cons

**Economic challenges:** Bennington's economy has struggled as manufacturing declined. Unemployment and poverty rates exceed Vermont averages. Median household income is low.

**Limited employment diversity:** Jobs concentrate in healthcare (Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, Veterans' Home), education, retail, and tourism. Professional positions are scarce.

**Remote from other Vermont cities:** Bennington is isolated in Vermont's southwestern corner—Burlington is 2.5 hours away, Rutland 1 hour. This feels disconnected from Vermont's core.

**Population decline:** Bennington (like many small Vermont cities) has experienced slow population decline, leading to closed businesses and aging infrastructure.

**Distance from VA Medical Center:** White River Junction is 2+ hours away (140+ miles), making complex care appointments a significant travel burden.

**Lower home appreciation:** Economic challenges mean home values appreciate slowly compared to Burlington or Montpelier, limiting wealth-building through real estate.

### Best For

- Veterans who want proximity to Vermont State Veterans' Home (for current or future long-term care needs)
- Retirees on fixed incomes seeking affordability
- Veterans open to commuting to Albany NY for higher-wage jobs
- History enthusiasts
- Those prioritizing low cost of living over employment diversity

- Transportation: $400
- Healthcare/insurance: $300
- Entertainment/misc: $400

**Surplus: $3,100** (excellent position for retirees with paid-off home)

**Verdict:** Bennington is ideal for retired veterans who've paid off mortgages and want low-cost living in community with strong veteran presence.

## #7: Winooski - Diverse, Walkable, Maximum Exemption, Adjacent to Burlington

**Overall Score: 8.0/10**

**Veteran Population:** Estimated 180-230 veterans
**Total Population:** 7,439 (small city, essentially a Burlington neighborhood)
**Median Home Price (2024-25):** $380,000-410,000 (estimated)
**Median Rent:** $1,250-1,350/month
**Property Tax Rate:** Similar to Burlington
**Veteran Property Tax Exemption:** $35,000 (near-maximum, second only to Burlington/South Burlington)
**Cost of Living Index:** 125-130% of U.S. national average
**Veteran Unemployment:** Estimated 2.5-3.0%

### Why Winooski Ranks #7

**$35,000 property tax exemption:** Winooski offers $35,000 exemption—higher than most Vermont cities and providing substantial tax savings.

**Most diverse city in Vermont:** Winooski is Vermont's most ethnically and culturally diverse community, with significant refugee populations (Bhutanese, Somali, Sudanese). Veterans who value diversity and multiculturalism thrive here.

**Extremely walkable:** Winooski is compact and walkable—you can access grocery stores, restaurants, schools, parks, and services on foot. This reduces transportation costs significantly.

**Burlington access without Burlington prices:** Winooski borders Burlington (5 minutes to downtown) while offering slightly lower housing costs. You get Burlington employment and amenities at modest discount.

**Burlington CBOC nearby:** Burlington-Lakeside CBOC is 10 minutes away, providing convenient VA healthcare access.

**Veteran-specific resource:** Canal Street Veteran Housing in Winooski provides supportive housing for homeless and at-risk veterans—demonstrating community commitment to veteran welfare.

**Urban revitalization:** Winooski has undergone significant downtown revitalization, with new restaurants, breweries (Four Quarters Brewing), and housing developments attracting young professionals and families.

### The Honest Cons

**Very small:** With only 7,439 residents, Winooski feels more like a neighborhood than a city. Limited housing inventory and few standalone amenities (most residents use Burlington services).

**Dense and urban:** Winooski's compact size means density—apartment buildings, limited green space, street parking challenges. Not ideal if you want a yard or suburban feel.

**Still expensive:** Cost of living remains 25-30% above national average. Housing costs are only marginally lower than Burlington.

**Limited standalone identity:** Winooski functions essentially as a Burlington neighborhood—most residents work, shop, and socialize in Burlington, using Winooski primarily for housing.

**Small veteran community:** With an estimated 180-230 veterans, the community is tiny. Harder to find veteran-specific events or large VSO posts.

**Noise and activity:** Urban density brings noise—traffic, nightlife (bars and breweries downtown), and general bustle. Not ideal for veterans seeking quiet.

### Best For

## Key Factors in Your Decision

### If Maximum Property Tax Savings is Your Priority

**Choose:** Burlington, South Burlington, or Winooski

These cities offer $35,000-$40,000 property tax exemptions—the highest in Vermont. Over 20 years, you'll save $14,000-$18,000 more than cities offering baseline $10,000 exemptions.

**Caveat:** Higher home prices in these cities may offset property tax savings. Run the numbers for your specific situation.

### If Affordability is Your Priority

**Choose:** Rutland or Bennington

Median home prices $258K-$295K (40%+ cheaper than Burlington) and cost of living at or below national average make these cities achievable on VA disability or modest retirement income.

**Caveat:** Employment opportunities are more limited, and you'll sacrifice some amenities available in larger cities.

### If VA Healthcare Access is Your Priority

**Choose:** Burlington, Rutland, Brattleboro, or Bennington

All have CBOCs providing primary care, mental health, and lab services on-site or within 10 minutes. You won't need to drive to White River Junction for routine care.

**Caveat:** Complex specialty care still requires travel to White River Junction from all cities. Rutland is 90 minutes away; Brattleboro and Bennington are 2+ hours.

### If Employment is Your Priority

**Choose:** Burlington or South Burlington

Chittenden County (Burlington metro) has Vermont's strongest job market, lowest unemployment, and highest wages. Tech, healthcare, education, and professional sectors all have opportunities.

**Caveat:** Higher cost of living means higher wages don't always translate to better quality of life. A $60,000 salary in Burlington provides similar purchasing power to $45,000 in Rutland.

### If You're a Retiree on Fixed Income

**Choose:** Rutland, Bennington, or Brattleboro

Moderate housing costs, reasonable property taxes (especially with exemptions), and below-average cost of living make these cities manageable on military retirement and VA disability alone.

**Caveat:** Limited employment means difficult to supplement retirement income if needed. Ensure your fixed income covers all expenses before committing.

### If You Have a Family

**Choose:** South Burlington or Burlington

Top-rated public schools, extensive youth programs, safe neighborhoods, and family amenities make these cities ideal for veterans with children.

**Caveat:** High cost of living means families typically need dual income. Single-parent veteran families may struggle financially.

### If You Value Small-Town Community

**Choose:** Montpelier, Bennington, or Winooski

Small populations (7,000-15,000) create tight-knit communities where people know their neighbors, participate in town meetings, and build lasting relationships.

**Caveat:** Limited anonymity—if you prefer privacy and blending in, small towns can feel intrusive. Everyone knows everyone's business.

**Q: Which Vermont city has the absolute lowest cost of living for veterans?**

A: Rutland. With median home price of $258,267, cost of living index 9.9% below national average, and rent at $1,150/month, Rutland is Vermont's most affordable major city. Bennington is a close second.

**Q: Where can I get the maximum property tax exemption?**

A: Burlington and South Burlington offer the maximum $40,000 exemption. Winooski offers $35,000. These are Vermont's highest property tax benefits for veterans.

**Q: I'm a 100% disabled veteran on a fixed income. Where should I live?**

A: Rutland or Brattleboro. Both offer solid property tax exemptions ($15,000-$20,000), on-site VA CBOCs, and cost of living at or below national average. Your VA disability of $3,737/month (2024 rate for 100% with no dependents) will provide comfortable living in either city.

**Q: Which city is best for finding a job as a veteran?**

A: Burlington or South Burlington. Chittenden County has Vermont's strongest job market, and the 5-point veteran hiring preference applies to state and federal positions. Healthcare, tech, education, and tourism sectors all hire actively.

**Q: My wife and I are retiring and want a small town with good veteran support. Where should we go?**

A: Montpelier or Bennington. Montpelier offers capital city charm, walkability, and intellectual community with population under 8,000. Bennington provides proximity to Vermont State Veterans' Home, on-site CBOC, and strong veteran community at affordable prices.

**Q: I'm using my GI Bill at UVM. Where should I live?**

A: Burlington, South Burlington, or Winooski. All three provide close proximity to UVM campus (10-15 minute commute), access to student housing or affordable apartments, and walkable/bikeable lifestyle reducing transportation costs.

**Q: How much do I actually save with the $40,000 property tax exemption vs. the $10,000 minimum?**

A: Approximately $450-$675 per year depending on local tax rates. Over 20 years, that's $9,000-$13,500 in additional savings. Burlington's combined rate of approximately $2.20 per $100 means $40,000 exemption saves $880/year vs. $220/year for $10,000 exemption—difference of $660 annually or $13,200 over 20 years.

**Q: Can I afford to buy a home in Vermont on VA disability alone?**

A: In Rutland or Bennington, yes—if you're rated 70%+ ($1,716/month) and have good credit. With median home prices around $260,000-$295,000 and VA loan (zero down payment), monthly mortgage payments would be $1,400-$1,600 including property taxes and insurance. This is tight but manageable at 70%+, comfortable at 90-100%. Burlington/Montpelier would be very difficult on VA disability alone.

**Q: I want to avoid cold winters. Which Vermont city is warmest?**

A: Burlington. Lake Champlain's moderating effect keeps Burlington 5-10°F warmer than inland cities in winter. That said, all Vermont cities have cold winters—Burlington's advantage is relative. If you truly want to avoid cold, consider southern or coastal states.

**Q: Which city has the best public schools for my kids?**

A: South Burlington and Burlington consistently rank highest on Vermont school quality metrics. Montpelier also has strong schools. Essex Junction (honorable mention) is excellent for families prioritizing education.

**Q: I'm concerned about political environment. Which city is most conservative/moderate?**

A: Vermont overall leans progressive, but Rutland and Bennington are Vermont's most politically moderate cities. Rural areas surrounding any city tend to be more conservative. Burlington, Montpelier, Brattleboro, and Winooski are notably progressive. If political culture is a major factor, spend time in each city before committing.

**Q: What if I need specialized VA care like surgery or cardiology?**

A: All veterans in Vermont travel to White River Junction VA Medical Center for complex specialty care, surgery, and advanced diagnostics. Burlington area is closest (75 minutes), Rutland is moderate (90 minutes), and Brattleboro/Bennington are furthest (2+ hours). If you anticipate frequent specialty appointments, Burlington area is most practical.

**Q: Can I live in Vermont and work remotely for an out-of-state employer?**

A: Absolutely. Vermont has strong internet infrastructure in cities (fiber optic available in Burlington, South Burlington, Montpelier, Brattleboro). Many veterans work remotely for employers in Boston, NYC, or other major cities while enjoying Vermont's quality of life. Just ensure your tax situation is handled correctly (Vermont will tax your income as a resident regardless of employer location).

**Q: How do I verify the exact property tax exemption amount for a specific town?**

A: Call the town assessor's office directly. Search "[Town Name] Vermont assessor" to find contact info. Ask: "What is the current property tax exemption amount for veterans with 50%+ VA disability rating?" Get the answer in writing if possible.

**Q: Are there neighborhoods within these cities I should avoid?**

A: Every city has variation. In Burlington, Old North End has higher crime but is improving. In Rutland, downtown has struggled with opioid issues but revitalization is ongoing. Brattleboro's West Brattleboro is older and less affluent. Research specific neighborhoods before buying—drive around, talk to neighbors, check crime statistics at city-data.com.

**Q: I'm a woman veteran. Which cities have the best support for women veterans?**

A: Burlington and South Burlington, due to proximity to Burlington-Lakeside CBOC which has Women Veterans Program Manager and connection to Women's Health Clinic at White River Junction. However, all cities provide access to VA women veterans services—difference is drive time.

**Q: What about winter driving? I'm from the South and have never driven in snow.**

A: Vermont cities plow roads thoroughly and quickly. Burlington/South Burlington have best snow removal due to larger budgets. All cities are navigable in winter with appropriate vehicle (all-wheel drive or front-wheel drive with snow tires). However, rural areas between cities can be treacherous in storms. Budget for snow tires ($600-$1,000 every 3-4 years) and consider defensive winter driving courses offered by some Vermont driving schools.

**Q: Can I have chickens/garden/livestock in these cities?**

A: Varies by city ordinances. Most Vermont cities allow backyard chickens with restrictions (number of birds, no roosters, coop setback requirements). Gardens are universally permitted. Larger livestock typically require rural properties outside city limits. Check specific city zoning ordinances before purchasing if chickens/gardening are priorities.

**Q: How important is the property tax exemption really?**

A: Very important for long-term savings. Example: $40,000 exemption in Burlington saves $880/year. Over a 30-year homeownership period, that's $26,400 in savings. If you're living in Vermont long-term, maximizing your property tax exemption can save tens of thousands of dollars. However, it shouldn't be your ONLY decision factor—overall cost of living, employment, and quality of life matter more than property tax exemption alone.

**Q: Are any of these cities good for starting a veteran-owned business?**

A: Burlington has the strongest ecosystem for small businesses—customer base, foot traffic, support services, networking. However, competition is fierce and commercial rents are high. Rutland, Brattleboro, and Bennington have lower costs and less competition, but smaller customer bases. Vermont has strong "buy local" culture that benefits small businesses. Vermont Office of Veterans Affairs can connect you with veteran business resources and SBA Vermont District Office (montpelier.sba.gov) provides veteran entrepreneur support.
