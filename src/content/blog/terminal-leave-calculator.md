# Terminal Leave Calculator: Should You Use It or Sell It? (2025 Guide)

## Bottom Line Up Front

Every separating service member faces this decision: take terminal leave or sell it back for cash? There's no universal right answer. It depends on your healthcare needs, job start date, and whether you value time or money more. **Most people with families should take the leave** for TRICARE coverage alone. Single folks with immediate job starts might benefit from the cash. Use our [Terminal Leave Calculator](/calculator/terminal-leave) to see the real numbers for your situation.

## The decision everyone faces

You've got 60 days of leave saved up. Maybe more. And now you're staring at two very different options.

Take it? You're technically still active duty, drawing full pay and benefits for another two months.

Sell it? You get a lump sum check and you're done. Civilian life starts now.

Simple choice, right?

Not really.

## Option 1: Take terminal leave

Here's what you keep when you take terminal leave:

- **Your full base pay** - same as always
- **BAH** if you're receiving it (and most people are)
- **TRICARE** for you and your family
- **Base access** for the gym, commissary, all of it
- **Time** to decompress, relocate, or just figure out what's next

You're still active duty. Your end of service date is just further out. You can start a civilian job during this time if you want (we'll get to that), or you can take an actual break.

## Option 2: Sell it back

Selling your leave means you get a check for your base pay multiplied by the number of days. Sounds great until you realize:

**The money gets taxed.** Not like normal paychecks either. It's a lump sum, which means it often gets hit at a higher rate. You might lose 25-30% to federal taxes right off the top.

**TRICARE ends immediately.** Your separation date is your separation date. No extended coverage. If you've got a family, you need insurance starting tomorrow.

**You're on the clock.** Got a cross-country move? Better hope you can do it fast. Need time to interview? Too bad. The military says you're done, so you're done.

## Let's talk real numbers

Say you're an E-6 with 60 days of leave. Your base pay is roughly $3,800/month, and you're getting $1,500 in BAH.

**If you take terminal leave:**
- 2 months of base pay: $7,600
- 2 months of BAH: $3,000
- 2 months of TRICARE: ~$1,500 value (compared to civilian insurance)
- **Total value: ~$12,100**

**If you sell it back:**
- Lump sum: $7,600 (base pay only, no BAH)
- After 25% federal tax: ~$5,700
- You need civilian insurance starting day 1: -$1,500
- **Net value: ~$4,200**

That's a **$7,900 difference**. For the same 60 days of leave.

Use our [Terminal Leave Calculator](/calculator/terminal-leave) to run your own numbers with your rank and BAH rate.

## The healthcare math is brutal

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat this. Healthcare in the civilian world is expensive.

Family coverage through most employers: **$600-1,200/month in premiums.** And that's the employee portion - the employer is paying way more.

Going on the marketplace? You're looking at **$1,000-2,000/month** for a family of four, depending on where you live and what plan you pick.

TRICARE? **$0/month** for active duty families. Sure, there's TRICARE Select after separation at $229/month for families, but that's still a fraction of civilian costs.

So when you sell back 60 days of leave, you're not just giving up two months of paychecks. You're giving up **$2,000-4,000 in healthcare costs** you would've avoided.

If anyone in your family has ongoing medical needs - prescriptions, physical therapy, pregnancy, literally anything - those savings multiply fast.

## When taking leave makes sense

You should probably take terminal leave if:

**You've got a family.** The TRICARE coverage alone usually makes this worth it. Run the numbers on civilian insurance premiums and you'll see what I mean.

**You need to relocate.** Moving from Okinawa to Ohio? You want time to do that without burning through your civilian PTO or trying to job hunt while living in a hotel.

**Your civilian job has flexibility.** Most good employers will work with you on a start date. If they can wait 60-90 days, take the leave.

**You're burned out.** Twenty years in and you're fried? Take. The. Break. You've earned it, and starting a civilian job while mentally exhausted is a recipe for failure.

**You don't have a job lined up yet.** Terminal leave buys you 2-3 months of paid time to interview, network, and find the right position instead of taking the first offer out of panic.

## When selling might make sense

Selling your leave could be the right call if:

**You're single with no dependents.** Healthcare costs aren't going to wreck you, and you can get on an employer plan immediately.

**Your civilian job starts NOW.** Some industries don't wait. If you've got a high-paying offer that requires you to start on a specific date, the math might favor selling.

**You need cash for a specific reason.** Buying a house and need more for the down payment? Starting a business? There are legitimate reasons to value immediate cash over extended benefits.

**You're going straight into grad school.** Student health plans are cheap, and you might value the extra cash for tuition.

**Your spouse has killer benefits.** If your spouse's health insurance is free or cheap and covers families well, the TRICARE advantage evaporates.

## What nobody tells you about taxes

When you sell terminal leave, the entire lump sum hits your W-2 in that tax year.

Let's say you separate in November and sell back 60 days at $7,600. That's $7,600 of income in November. On top of your ten months of regular military pay. On top of any civilian income you earn in November-December.

**This can bump you into a higher tax bracket** for the year. It can also surprise you next April when you owe money instead of getting a refund.

Taking terminal leave spreads that money across two months of normal paychecks, which usually means less tax impact.

Talk to a tax person if you're on the fence. Seriously. A hundred bucks for a consultation could save you thousands.

## The TRICARE gap nobody plans for

Here's a scenario we see all the time:

You sell your leave. You separate on January 15th. Your civilian job starts February 1st, and benefits kick in March 1st (most employers have a 30-day waiting period).

Congratulations, you've got **45 days with no health insurance.**

Hope nobody gets sick. Hope your kid doesn't break an arm. Hope your spouse's prescription doesn't run out.

You can get COBRA or marketplace insurance for the gap, but now you're paying $1,500-2,000 out of pocket for coverage you could've had for free.

## Can you work during terminal leave?

Yes. You can absolutely start your civilian job while on terminal leave. You're still getting your military paycheck, and you can draw a civilian paycheck too.

**BUT** - check with your gaining employer's HR department first. Some companies have policies about dual employment, especially if there are security clearances involved. Most don't care. Some do.

And obviously, don't take a civilian job that conflicts with any post-service restrictions (contracting back to your old unit, etc.). That's a different mess.

## The mental health angle

This is touchy, but it's real.

If you've been running at 100mph for years - deployments, underways, TDYs, the whole thing - your brain needs time to shift gears.

Going straight from military service to a civilian job without a break? Some people handle it fine. Others crash hard in month three when the adrenaline wears off.

Terminal leave gives you a buffer. Time to decompress. Time to remember what it's like to not have a 24/7 job. Time to figure out who you are when you're not in uniform.

You can't put a dollar value on that. But it's worth considering.

## How to actually decide

Here's how to think through this:

1. **Run the numbers** with our [Terminal Leave Calculator](/calculator/terminal-leave). Get the real comparison for your rank and situation.

2. **Calculate healthcare costs.** What would insurance cost you during those 60 days? Be honest.

3. **Check your job timeline.** When does your civilian job start? When do benefits kick in?

4. **Consider your life situation.** Moving? Family needs? Mental health? These aren't line items on a spreadsheet, but they matter.

5. **Do the tax math.** Will a lump sum push you into a higher bracket? Talk to a tax professional if you're not sure.

6. **Trust your gut.** After you've done the analysis, which option gives you more peace of mind?

## What we recommend

For most people? **Take the leave.**

The math usually works out better, especially if you've got a family. The TRICARE coverage alone tips the scales. Add in BAH, relocation time, and a mental health buffer, and it's not even close.

But every situation is different. Run your numbers. [Use the calculator](/calculator/terminal-leave). Make an informed decision instead of just doing what your buddy did.

## Common mistakes to avoid

**Don't assume you have to decide immediately.** You've got time to run the numbers and think it through.

**Don't forget about BAH.** You lose that if you sell back. For some people, that's $2,000+/month.

**Don't ignore healthcare.** Seriously, civilian insurance is expensive. Factor it in.

**Don't sell back just because you want to be "done" with the military.** Terminal leave is still separation. You just get paid more for it.

**Don't take advice from people who separated 10 years ago.** Rules change. Pay scales change. Healthcare costs definitely change.

## The bottom line

Terminal leave vs. selling it back isn't a trick question. It's a personal finance decision based on your specific circumstances.

Most people benefit more from taking the leave. But some people genuinely need the cash or have situations where selling makes sense.

Do the math. Consider your healthcare needs. Think about your timeline. Then decide.

And for the love of all that's holy, use our free [Terminal Leave Calculator](/calculator/terminal-leave) to see the actual numbers instead of guessing.

You've got one shot at this decision. Make it count.
