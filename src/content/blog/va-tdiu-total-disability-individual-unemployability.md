# VA TDIU: Total Disability Individual Unemployability Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

**TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability)** allows veterans who can't maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities to receive **100% compensation** even if their combined rating is less than 100%. If your disabilities prevent you from working but your rating is 60-90%, TDIU could get you **$3,737.85/month** (2024 rate) instead of your current lower payment. It's an often-overlooked path to maximum benefits.

## What Is TDIU?

TDIU is a VA benefit that pays you at the **100% disability rate** when:
- Your service-connected disabilities prevent substantially gainful employment
- Your combined rating is less than 100%

**It's not a rating—it's a compensation status.** Your rating stays the same (e.g., 70%), but you receive 100% pay.

## TDIU Eligibility Requirements

### Schedular TDIU (Standard Path)

To qualify under standard rules, you need:

**Option A:**
- One service-connected disability rated **60% or higher**

**Option B:**
- Combined rating of **70% or higher**
- At least one disability rated **40% or higher**

**AND for both:**
- Unable to maintain **substantially gainful employment** due to service-connected disabilities

### Extra-Schedular TDIU

If you don't meet the schedular requirements but can't work due to service-connected disabilities:
- Your case can be referred to the Director of Compensation Service
- They can grant TDIU on an extra-schedular basis
- Less common but available

### "Substantially Gainful Employment"

This is the key standard. It means:
- Employment that provides more than **marginal income**
- 2024 poverty threshold: ~$15,060/year
- If you earn above poverty level, employment is considered "substantially gainful"

**Exceptions:**
- Sheltered employment (working for family who accommodates your disability)
- Protected environment work
- May still qualify even if earning above poverty level in certain circumstances

## TDIU vs. 100% Schedular

| Factor | TDIU | 100% Schedular |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Monthly pay | Same ($3,737.85) | Same |
| Working | Restricted | No restrictions |
| DEA benefits | Yes | Yes |
| ChampVA | Yes | Yes |
| State benefits | Varies by state | Usually all |
| Protected? | Can be reduced if you work | More stable |

### Key Differences

**Working:** TDIU has restrictions; 100% schedular doesn't
**Stability:** 100% schedular is more protected
**Requirements:** Different paths to get there

**If you can get 100% schedular, it's generally better than TDIU due to work flexibility.**

## How to Apply for TDIU

### Step 1: File VA Form 21-8940

**Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability**

This form asks about:
- Your service-connected disabilities
- Employment history
- Education level
- Why you can't work

### Step 2: Submit VA Form 21-4192 (Optional)

**Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits**

Have former employers complete this form to document:
- Employment dates
- Reason for leaving
- Accommodations made

### Step 3: Provide Supporting Evidence

**Include:**
- Medical records showing disability impact on work
- Doctor statements about work capacity
- Personal statement explaining inability to work
- Employment records

### Step 4: Attend C&P Exam

VA will likely schedule a C&P exam to assess:
- Severity of your disabilities
- Functional impact on employment

## What VA Considers

### Medical Evidence

The VA looks at:
- Severity of service-connected disabilities
- How disabilities affect work-related functions
- Medical opinions about work capacity
- Treatment records showing limitations

### Employment History

- Jobs you've held
- Why you left positions
- Whether you've been fired or forced to quit
- Accommodations employers made
- Education and training

### Type of Work Available

VA considers whether you can perform:
- Sedentary work (if physical disabilities)
- Physical work (if mental disabilities)
- Any type of substantially gainful employment

### Individual Circumstances

- Education level
- Training and skills
- Age (as it affects ability to retrain)
- Prior work experience

## Common Reasons TDIU Is Denied

### 1. Currently Working Above Marginal Income

If you're earning above poverty level in non-protected employment, you'll likely be denied.

**Solution:** If your current employment is protected/sheltered, document it. If not, you may need to stop working to qualify.

### 2. Insufficient Medical Evidence

VA doesn't see how disabilities prevent employment.

**Solution:** Get a medical opinion specifically addressing inability to work due to your service-connected conditions.

### 3. Disabilities Don't Meet Schedular Requirements

Don't have 60% single or 70% combined.

**Solution:** File for increase on existing conditions or secondary conditions to meet requirements. Or pursue extra-schedular TDIU.

### 4. Education/Skills Suggest Employability

VA believes you could do sedentary work based on your background.

**Solution:** Provide evidence that your disabilities affect sedentary work capacity (mental health, fatigue, medication side effects, etc.).

## Building a Strong TDIU Claim

### Medical Opinion

The strongest evidence is a medical opinion stating:
- Your service-connected disabilities prevent substantially gainful employment
- Specific limitations that affect work
- Why sedentary alternatives aren't viable

### Social and Industrial Survey

Request or obtain a vocational evaluation showing:
- Your work limitations
- Types of jobs you cannot perform
- Assessment of employability

### Personal Statement

Write a detailed statement explaining:
- How your disabilities affect daily life
- Why you can't maintain employment
- Examples of work problems
- How symptoms interfere with work functions

### Employment Documentation

Gather:
- Termination letters
- Performance reviews showing decline
- ADA accommodation requests
- Letters from employers about limitations

## TDIU and Working

### Marginal Employment Exception

You can earn up to the **poverty threshold** (~$15,060/year in 2024) without losing TDIU.

**Example:** Part-time work earning $12,000/year likely won't affect TDIU.

### Protected/Sheltered Employment

Work in a protected environment (family business, understanding employer making significant accommodations) may not count as substantially gainful even if above poverty threshold.

**Document this carefully.**

### Rehabilitation Programs

You can participate in VA Vocational Rehabilitation (VR&E) while on TDIU:
- Training and education allowed
- Work under VR&E protection
- Transition planning

### Working While on TDIU: Risks

If you work and earn above marginal income:
- VA may propose reduction
- You'll have opportunity to respond
- May lose TDIU status

**Important:** VA can audit your income. Don't hide employment.

## TDIU and Other Benefits

### Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA)

TDIU qualifies your dependents for DEA benefits:
- Chapter 35 education benefits
- Up to 36 months of education for dependents

### ChampVA

Dependents qualify for ChampVA healthcare coverage.

### State Benefits

Some state benefits require "100% P&T" (Permanent and Total):
- TDIU may or may not qualify
- Check your specific state's requirements
- Some accept TDIU, others require schedular 100%

### Social Security

TDIU doesn't automatically qualify you for Social Security Disability (SSDI/SSI):
- Different standards
- Can receive both
- Apply for Social Security separately

## TDIU and Permanent & Total (P&T)

### Can TDIU Be P&T?

Yes. Your TDIU can be designated Permanent & Total if VA determines your unemployability is permanent.

**Check your rating letter for:**
- "No future examinations scheduled"
- "Permanent and Total" language

### Benefits of P&T Status

- No re-evaluations
- More state benefits
- Greater stability
- DEA benefits become permanent

## Appeals If Denied

### Higher-Level Review

If TDIU denied but you believe evidence supports it.

### Supplemental Claim

Submit with new evidence:
- Nexus letter specifically addressing unemployability
- Vocational assessment
- Additional employment documentation

### Board Appeal

For complex cases requiring judge review.

## Common Questions

### Can I work part-time on TDIU?

Yes, as long as earnings stay below the poverty threshold (marginal employment). Above that is risky.

### Will VA review my TDIU status?

Yes. VA can review, especially if they receive income information suggesting substantially gainful employment.

### Can I get TDIU temporarily?

TDIU can be temporary while you recover or permanent if your unemployability won't improve.

### Does age matter?

VA can consider age when evaluating ability to adapt or retrain, but TDIU isn't age-based.

### Can TDIU be combined with Social Security?

Yes. You can receive both VA disability compensation (including TDIU) and Social Security benefits simultaneously.

### What if I become able to work?

Notify VA. You may transition off TDIU if you return to substantially gainful employment.

## Key Takeaways

1. **TDIU provides 100% pay** without 100% rating
2. **Requirements:** 60% single OR 70% combined (with 40%+ single)
3. **Must be unable** to maintain substantially gainful employment
4. **Can work marginally** (below poverty threshold)
5. **File VA Form 21-8940** to apply
6. **Strong medical opinion** is critical
7. **TDIU can be P&T** for maximum stability

If your disabilities prevent you from working but your rating isn't 100%, TDIU could be the path to maximum compensation.
