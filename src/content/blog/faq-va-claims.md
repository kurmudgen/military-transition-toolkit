## FILING CLAIMS (Q001-Q020)

### Q001: How do I file my first VA disability claim? {#q001}

**A:** You can file your VA disability claim online through VA.gov, by mail using VA Form 21-526EZ, through a VA regional office in person, or with help from an accredited Veterans Service Officer (VSO).

The online method through VA.gov is the fastest and most convenient option. You'll need to create a login.gov or ID.me account to access the eBenefits portal. The online application walks you through each step and allows you to upload supporting documents directly.

Before filing, gather these essential items:
- Your DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)
- Medical records showing your current diagnosis
- Service treatment records (STRs) documenting the injury or illness during service
- Any buddy statements or lay evidence supporting your claim
- Private medical records if you've sought treatment outside the VA

The VA recommends using VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File) before submitting your full claim. This reserves your effective date and gives you up to one year to gather evidence while preserving your potential back pay date.

Processing times average 140-150 days as of 2024, though this varies by regional office and claim complexity. Working with a VSO can significantly improve your chances of approval on the first submission.

### Q002: What is an Intent to File and why should I submit one? {#q002}

**A:** An Intent to File (VA Form 21-0966) is a notice that reserves your effective date for up to one year while you gather evidence for your full claim, potentially increasing your back pay by thousands of dollars.

When the VA approves your claim, they pay you retroactively from your "effective date"—usually the date they received your claim. If you submit an Intent to File on January 1, 2024, but don't file your complete claim until October 1, 2024, your effective date is still January 1. This means you'll receive 9 additional months of back pay that you wouldn't get if you filed your complete claim in October without an Intent to File.

**Example scenario:**
- You submit an Intent to File on March 1, 2024
- You're eventually awarded 70% disability ($1,716.28/month in 2024)
- You complete your full claim on December 1, 2024 (9 months later)
- You receive $15,446.52 in back pay (9 months × $1,716.28) from the March effective date
- Without the Intent to File, your back pay would only go back to December

**Important considerations:**
- You have exactly 1 year from the Intent to File date to submit your complete claim
- If you miss the 1-year deadline, your effective date becomes the date you finally file
- An Intent to File doesn't require any evidence—just basic information
- You can submit it online in about 5 minutes through VA.gov
- You can have multiple Intents to File for different types of benefits

The Intent to File is especially valuable when you're still gathering medical records, waiting for appointments, or working on getting a nexus letter. It protects your financial interests while you build the strongest possible claim.

### Q003: How long does it take the VA to process a disability claim? {#q003}

**A:** As of 2024, the average VA disability claim takes approximately 140-150 days to process, though individual claims can take anywhere from 60 days to over a year depending on complexity.

The VA tracks claims processing time from the date they receive your claim to the date they make a decision. This timeline varies significantly based on several factors:

**Factors that affect processing time:**

*Faster processing (60-90 days):*
- Fully Developed Claims (FDC) with all evidence submitted upfront
- Claims for conditions with clear service connection
- Single-condition claims
- Use of direct VA medical records
- Claims filed by veterans already in the VA healthcare system

*Slower processing (6-12+ months):*
- Complex claims with multiple conditions
- Claims requiring C&P exams from contracted providers
- Claims involving records requests from military archives
- Appeals or supplemental claims with new evidence
- Claims for conditions requiring detailed medical opinions

**Regional variation:**
Processing times differ by VA Regional Office. Some offices process claims in 100 days on average, while others take 200+ days. You can check processing times at your regional office on VA.gov.

**How to check your claim status:**
- Online: Log into VA.gov and check your claim status tracker
- Phone: Call 1-800-827-1000
- Mobile: Use the VA mobile app

The VA has made significant improvements in recent years. In 2013, the average wait was over 260 days. Today's 140-150 day average represents substantial progress, though there's still room for improvement.

If your claim has been pending for longer than the average timeframe, you can contact the VA or your VSO to inquire about the delay.

### Q004: Can I file a claim while still on active duty? {#q004}

**A:** Yes, through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program, you can file a disability claim 90 to 180 days before your separation date, potentially receiving benefits as soon as you leave service.

The BDD program is designed to help transitioning service members get their VA disability compensation started as quickly as possible after discharge. This program is one of the most valuable—yet underutilized—resources for separating service members.

**BDD eligibility requirements:**
- You must file between 90-180 days before separation
- You must be available for VA exams for at least 45 days
- You must have a copy of your service treatment records
- You must be separating under honorable conditions

**Benefits of using BDD:**
- Receive disability compensation within 60 days of separation (vs. 140+ days for standard claims)
- Complete C&P exams while still on active duty
- Get help from military transition counselors
- Seamless transition from military pay to disability compensation
- Earlier effective date preserves back pay

**How to file a BDD claim:**

1. **90-180 days before separation:** Submit VA Form 21-526EZ through eBenefits, VA.gov, or with a VSO
2. **Attend C&P exams:** Schedule and complete all required exams before separation
3. **Provide service treatment records:** Upload or deliver your STRs to the VA
4. **Separate from service:** Complete your military out-processing
5. **Receive decision:** Get your rating decision within 60 days of separation

**Important notes:**
- If you file more than 180 days out, your claim will be rejected
- If you file less than 90 days before separation, use the standard claims process instead
- You must be available for C&P exams—if you're deploying or will be unavailable, BDD won't work
- National Guard and Reserve members can use BDD if separating from active duty orders of 90+ days

**What to claim:**
File for everything that happened or worsened during service, even if symptoms seem minor. Conditions often worsen after separation, and it's much easier to prove service connection while you're still in uniform with recent service treatment records.

### Q005: What does "service-connected" mean? {#q005}

**A:** "Service-connected" means your disability or condition was caused by, aggravated by, or otherwise related to your military service, making you eligible for VA disability compensation.

The VA will grant service connection for a disability if you can prove three key elements:

**1. Current diagnosis**
You must have a current medical diagnosis of the condition. This can be from a VA provider, private doctor, or even diagnosed during your C&P exam. The diagnosis must be documented in medical records.

**2. In-service event, injury, or illness**
Something must have happened during your military service that caused or contributed to your current condition. This could be:
- A specific injury (combat wound, training accident, vehicle collision)
- Exposure to hazards (burn pits, Agent Orange, loud noise)
- Development of illness during service
- Aggravation of a pre-existing condition beyond its natural progression

**3. Nexus (connection)**
There must be a medical link between your current diagnosis and your in-service event. This is often called a "nexus." The VA standard is "at least as likely as not" (50% or greater probability) that your current condition is related to service.

**Types of service connection:**

**Direct service connection:** The condition was directly caused by military service
- Example: Hearing loss from exposure to weapons fire

**Secondary service connection:** The condition was caused by another service-connected disability
- Example: Sleep apnea caused by service-connected PTSD

**Presumptive service connection:** The VA automatically presumes certain conditions are service-connected based on where or when you served
- Example: Respiratory conditions for veterans with burn pit exposure under the PACT Act
- Example: Type 2 diabetes for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange

**Aggravation:** A pre-existing condition that permanently worsened beyond its natural progression due to service
- Example: Pre-service asthma that significantly worsened during military service

**Understanding service connection is crucial** because only service-connected disabilities qualify for VA disability compensation. Non-service-connected conditions can still be treated through VA healthcare (if you're enrolled), but they don't result in monthly compensation.

### Q006: What are presumptive conditions under the PACT Act? {#q006}

**A:** The PACT Act added over 20 presumptive conditions for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic exposures, meaning the VA automatically presumes these conditions are service-connected if you served in specific locations and time periods.

The PACT Act (Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act) is perhaps the largest expansion of VA benefits in history, signed into law in August 2022 with implementation continuing through 2024.

**What "presumptive" means:**
Normally, you must prove your condition is connected to service. With presumptive conditions, if you served in designated locations during specific time periods and develop one of the listed conditions, the VA automatically assumes (presumes) your service caused it. You only need to prove:
1. You served in the qualifying location/time period
2. You have a current diagnosis of the condition

You don't need to prove the toxic exposure actually happened or that it caused your condition.

**Qualifying locations and time periods:**

*Gulf War and post-9/11 locations (on or after August 2, 1990):*
- Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman
- Djibouti, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Jordan
- Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey (certain airbases)
- Any other location where VA determines burn pit exposure occurred

*Vietnam War (August 5, 1964 - May 7, 1975):*
- Republic of Vietnam (for Agent Orange)
- Thailand (certain locations)
- Other locations with herbicide exposure

**New presumptive conditions added (2022-2024):**

*Cancers (12):*
- Brain cancer
- Gastrointestinal cancers (colon, pancreatic, others)
- Glioblastoma
- Head and neck cancers
- Kidney cancer
- Lymphomas
- Melanoma
- Reproductive cancers
- Respiratory cancers (lung, bronchus, larynx, trachea)

*Respiratory illnesses (12):*
- Asthma diagnosed after service
- Chronic bronchitis
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Chronic rhinitis
- Chronic sinusitis
- Constrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis
- Emphysema
- Granulomatous disease
- Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
- Pleuritis
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Sarcoidosis

*Other conditions:*
- Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)

**2024 updates:**
In June 2024, VA added three additional cancers: male breast cancer, urethral cancer, and paraurethral gland cancer.

**How to file a PACT Act claim:**
1. File a standard disability claim (VA Form 21-526EZ)
2. Provide proof of service in qualifying locations (DD-214 usually sufficient)
3. Provide medical diagnosis of the presumptive condition
4. No need for a nexus letter or additional proof of exposure

**Important note:** Even if you previously filed for these conditions and were denied, you should file again. Many veterans are getting claims approved that were previously denied before the PACT Act.

### Q007: How much back pay will I receive if my claim is approved? {#q007}

**A:** Back pay is calculated from your effective date (usually your claim filing date) to your decision date, multiplied by your monthly disability rate, typically ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars.

The amount of back pay depends on three main factors:

**1. Your disability rating (determines monthly amount)**
2024 monthly rates for veterans without dependents:
- 10%: $171.23
- 20%: $338.49
- 30%: $524.31
- 40%: $755.28
- 50%: $1,075.16
- 60%: $1,361.88
- 70%: $1,716.28
- 80%: $1,995.01
- 90%: $2,241.91
- 100%: $3,737.85

**2. Your effective date (when back pay starts)**
Usually the date VA received your claim or Intent to File, whichever is earlier. Special rules apply for:
- BDD claims: Date of separation
- Claims within 1 year of separation: Day after separation
- Supplemental claims: Date of new claim (not original claim)
- Increased ratings: Date condition worsened or date of new claim

**3. Length of time to decision**
From effective date to decision date (when VA approves your claim)

**Example calculations:**

*Example 1: Standard claim*
- Effective date: January 1, 2024 (Intent to File submitted)
- Decision date: July 1, 2024 (6 months later)
- Rating: 70% ($1,716.28/month)
- Back pay: 6 months × $1,716.28 = $10,297.68

*Example 2: Longer processing*
- Effective date: March 1, 2023
- Decision date: November 1, 2024 (20 months)
- Rating: 50% ($1,075.16/month)
- Back pay: 20 months × $1,075.16 = $21,503.20

*Example 3: Multiple ratings*
If you're awarded multiple ratings that change over time during the processing period, the VA calculates each period separately and adds them together.

**How and when you receive back pay:**

Back pay is typically paid as a lump sum via direct deposit within 2-4 weeks of your award decision. In some cases, the VA may split large payments into multiple installments.

**Important considerations:**

- Back pay is **tax-free** (VA disability compensation is not taxable income)
- If you have dependents (spouse, children), your monthly rate is higher, which means more back pay
- If you had an Intent to File, your effective date goes back to that date, not your full claim date
- For increased ratings, back pay only goes to when the condition worsened or when you filed for increase
- The VA may offset back pay for certain VA benefits you received during the pending period

**Protecting your effective date:**

The most important factor in maximizing back pay is protecting your effective date through:
- Filing an Intent to File before gathering all evidence
- Filing within 1 year of separation if recently separated
- Filing supplemental claims promptly if you have new evidence
- Appealing within the 1-year window if denied

A veteran who files an Intent to File and then takes 11 months to submit their complete claim can receive nearly a full year of additional back pay compared to someone who waits to file until they have everything ready.

### Q008: Can I file a claim for multiple conditions at once? {#q008}

**A:** Yes, you should file for all service-connected conditions in a single claim to streamline processing, and the VA will evaluate each condition separately and assign individual ratings that combine into your overall disability percentage.

Filing for multiple conditions simultaneously is not only allowed—it's recommended. Here's why:

**Benefits of filing multiple conditions together:**

1. **One application process:** Complete VA Form 21-526EZ once, listing all conditions
2. **Single C&P exam cycle:** The VA often schedules multiple exams together or during one appointment period
3. **Better overall picture:** The examiner can see how conditions interact and affect you holistically
4. **Higher combined rating:** Multiple conditions combine using VA math to reach higher overall ratings
5. **Same effective date:** All approved conditions share the same effective date, maximizing back pay

**How to list multiple conditions:**

When filling out VA Form 21-526EZ, you'll see sections for listing conditions. For each condition, provide:
- Specific name of the condition (use medical terminology when possible)
- When symptoms first appeared
- How it's related to service
- How it affects your daily life

**Example of proper filing:**

Instead of filing separate claims for:
- "Back problems"
- "Mental health"
- "Hearing"

List specific conditions:
- "Degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine"
- "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)"
- "Tinnitus, bilateral"
- "Hearing loss, bilateral sensorineural"
- "Sleep apnea, obstructive"
- "Radiculopathy, left lower extremity, secondary to lumbar spine"

**Strategic considerations:**

**File now vs. wait:**
If you have strong evidence for some conditions but need to gather evidence for others, you have options:

*Option 1:* Submit Intent to File, then file all conditions together when ready (within 1 year)
*Option 2:* File well-supported conditions now, add others as supplemental claims later (but with later effective dates)

Most VSOs recommend Option 1 to preserve the earliest effective date for all conditions.

**Primary vs. secondary conditions:**
You can file for both primary (directly service-connected) and secondary (caused by a service-connected condition) in the same claim. Example:
- Primary: Knee injury from service
- Secondary: Lower back pain caused by altered gait from knee injury

**Common multi-condition claims:**

Veterans often file for related groups:
- Musculoskeletal: Back, neck, knees, shoulders
- Mental health: PTSD, depression, anxiety
- Sleep/breathing: Sleep apnea, insomnia
- Hearing: Tinnitus, hearing loss
- Gulf War: Multiple respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological conditions

**How the VA processes multiple conditions:**

The VA will:
1. Review each condition separately
2. Order C&P exams for each (may be multiple appointments)
3. Rate each condition individually
4. Combine ratings using VA math (not simple addition)
5. Issue one decision with all ratings

**If some conditions are denied:**
The VA may approve some conditions and deny others in the same claim. Each condition receives its own decision that can be appealed independently.

**Timeline considerations:**

Multiple-condition claims don't necessarily take longer than single-condition claims. In fact, filing separate claims creates duplicate work and may extend your overall timeline.

### Q009: Do I need a lawyer or VSO to file a VA claim? {#q009}

**A:** No, you can file a VA claim yourself, but working with a free Veterans Service Officer (VSO) significantly increases approval rates and is highly recommended, especially for first-time filers.

**Your three options:**

**1. File on your own (DIY)**

*Pros:*
- Complete control over your claim
- No waiting for appointments
- Learn the system thoroughly
- Can file immediately online

*Cons:*
- Steep learning curve for VA regulations
- Easy to make costly mistakes
- May miss important evidence or arguments
- Lower initial approval rates
- No one to advocate if claim is denied

*Best for:* Simple, straightforward claims with clear service connection and strong evidence

**2. Work with a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) - RECOMMENDED**

*Pros:*
- **Completely free** (by law, VSOs cannot charge fees)
- Experienced with VA claims process
- Know common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Can access your records through VA systems
- Represent you in appeals
- Higher approval rates than DIY claims
- Many are veterans themselves

*Cons:*
- May have to wait for appointments
- Quality varies by individual VSO
- Less control over timeline
- Some VSOs are overworked and less responsive

*Best for:* Most veterans, especially first-time filers and complex claims

**Major VSO organizations:**
- Disabled American Veterans (DAV)
- Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
- American Legion
- Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)
- Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA)
- AMVETS
- State/county veterans services offices

**3. Hire an accredited attorney or claims agent**

*Pros:*
- Professional expertise
- Motivated by payment (contingency fee)
- Good for complex appeals
- Resources for medical opinions and evidence
- Aggressive advocacy

*Cons:*
- **Expensive:** Typically 20-33% of back pay
- Can only charge fees for appeals (not initial claims)
- May not be worth the cost for straightforward claims
- Still not better than a good VSO for many claims

*Best for:* Complex appeals, denials after working with VSO, large back pay at stake, legal issues

**How to find and work with a VSO:**

1. **Search for local VSOs:**
   - VA.gov VSO search tool
   - Contact your county/state veterans office
   - Visit your local VA medical center
   - Call major VSO organizations

2. **Schedule an intake appointment:**
   - Bring your DD-214
   - Bring medical records if you have them
   - List all conditions you want to claim
   - Be honest and thorough about symptoms

3. **Sign VA Form 21-22** (Appointment of VSO):
   - Authorizes the VSO to represent you
   - Allows them to access your VA records
   - Required before they can help with your claim

4. **Stay involved:**
   - Respond promptly to requests for information
   - Attend all C&P exams
   - Keep your VSO updated on changes
   - Don't assume they're handling everything—follow up

**Statistics on representation:**

While exact statistics vary, studies show:
- VSO-assisted claims have 10-20% higher approval rates
- Appeals with representation are significantly more successful
- Initial claims can be filed successfully DIY, but appeals benefit greatly from expertise

**When to switch representatives:**

If your VSO is:
- Not responding to calls/emails for weeks
- Missing deadlines
- Giving incorrect advice
- Not filing documents you've requested

You can switch VSOs or hire an attorney at any time by filing a new VA Form 21-22.

**Bottom line recommendation:**

For your initial claim: Work with a VSO (free and effective)
For appeals after denial: Continue with VSO or consider an attorney if claim is complex
For straightforward increases: Can do yourself if you understand the process

The cost-benefit analysis strongly favors using a free VSO for most veterans. The potential increase in your rating by even 10% (about $1,200/year) far outweighs the time investment of working with a VSO.

### Q010: What is a Fully Developed Claim and should I file one? {#q010}

**A:** A Fully Developed Claim (FDC) is a faster-tracked claim where you submit all evidence upfront, potentially reducing processing time by 30-60 days, but you give up the right for the VA to help you gather evidence.

**How FDC works:**

In a standard claim, the VA will help gather evidence by:
- Requesting your service treatment records
- Requesting VA medical records
- Requesting private medical records (with authorization)
- Providing C&P exams

With an FDC, **you** gather and submit all evidence yourself before filing, promising you have nothing else to add. In exchange, the VA prioritizes your claim and aims for faster processing.

**FDC requirements:**

To file an FDC, you must submit:

1. **Completed VA Form 21-526EZ** with FDC designation
2. **All service treatment records** (STRs) relevant to your claim
3. **All VA medical records** related to your claimed conditions
4. **All private medical records** from non-VA providers
5. **Any supporting statements** (buddy statements, personal statements)
6. **DD-214** (proof of service)

You're certifying these five things:
- You have no additional evidence to submit
- You understand VA will not assist in gathering evidence
- You authorize VA to request records you've identified
- You'll attend all VA exams if requested
- You'll certify you're not missing any relevant records

**Pros of FDC:**

- **Faster processing:** Average 30-60 days quicker than standard claims
- **Priority handling:** FDCs jump ahead in the queue
- **Your timeline:** File when YOU'RE ready with all evidence
- **Better organization:** Forces you to gather comprehensive evidence upfront
- **Option to convert:** Can convert to standard claim if you later find missing evidence

**Cons of FDC:**

- **More work upfront:** You must gather all records yourself
- **Risk of incomplete evidence:** Easy to overlook important records
- **No VA assistance:** VA won't help track down missing records
- **May delay filing:** Gathering everything might take months
- **Could miss Intent to File window:** If you can't gather everything within 1 year

**Who should file an FDC:**

*Good candidates:*
- Veterans with well-documented conditions
- Those with all medical records in hand
- Simple, straightforward claims
- Veterans who've already used VA healthcare (records easily accessible)
- Those with help from a VSO organizing evidence

*Poor candidates:*
- Recently separated veterans waiting on military records
- Those with incomplete medical documentation
- Complex claims with multiple conditions
- Veterans who haven't gathered private medical records
- Claims requiring extensive records requests

**FDC vs. Standard Claim timeline comparison:**

*FDC timeline example:*
- Month 1: Gather all records
- Month 2: Submit FDC
- Month 3-4: VA reviews (no waiting on records)
- Month 4: C&P exam
- Month 5: Decision
- **Total: 5 months from start to decision**

*Standard claim example:*
- Month 1: File claim
- Month 2-3: VA requests records
- Month 4: Records received
- Month 5: C&P exam
- Month 6-7: Decision
- **Total: 7 months from filing to decision**

**Important notes:**

**You can convert from FDC to standard claim** if:
- You discover missing evidence after filing
- VA identifies needed evidence you don't have
- Your claim becomes more complex than anticipated

Simply inform the VA you want to convert, and your claim continues as standard. Your effective date doesn't change—it remains the date you filed the FDC.

**FDC doesn't guarantee speed:**
While FDCs are prioritized, they still depend on:
- C&P exam availability
- Complexity of your conditions
- Regional office workload

Some FDCs still take the full 140+ days if exams are delayed or the claim is complex.

**The VA's perspective:**

The VA encourages FDCs because:
- Reduces their workload requesting records
- Fewer delays waiting on records requests
- Clears backlog faster
- Better evidence often leads to faster decisions

**Bottom line recommendation:**

File an FDC if:
- You have all records in hand
- Your VSO confirms evidence is complete
- You're confident in your documentation
- You want to prioritize speed

File a standard claim if:
- You're missing any medical records
- You're unsure what evidence you need
- You want VA assistance gathering evidence
- You're filing close to your Intent to File expiration

Many VSOs recommend standard claims for first-time filers to ensure nothing is missed, but FDC can work well for increases or straightforward claims where you know exactly what's needed.

### Q011: What is the difference between VA disability and military medical retirement? {#q011}

**A:** VA disability compensation is a monthly benefit for service-connected conditions from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while military medical retirement is a pension from the Department of Defense for service members medically discharged with conditions that make them unfit for duty.

These are two separate systems with different purposes, eligibility, and payment rules:

**VA Disability Compensation (from VA):**

*Purpose:* Compensate for loss of earning capacity due to service-connected disabilities

*Eligibility:*
- Any veteran with a service-connected condition
- Any disability rating (10%-100%)
- Honorable, general, or some other discharge types
- Applies after leaving service

*Payment:*
- Based solely on disability rating
- Tax-free
- Not reduced by other income
- Continues for life (as long as condition exists)
- Subject to periodic re-evaluations

*Requirements:*
- Must apply for VA disability
- Must prove service connection
- Rating based on severity of condition, not fitness for duty

**Military Medical Retirement (from DoD):**

*Purpose:* Provide retirement pension for service members who cannot continue military service due to medical conditions

*Eligibility:*
- Must be found "unfit for duty" by Physical Evaluation Board (PEB)
- Disability rating of 30% or higher (DOD rating, not VA rating)
- Typically for active-duty members medically discharged
- Or 20+ years of service with retirement-eligible status

*Payment:*
- Based on either disability rating OR longevity (whichever is higher)
- Formula: (Years of service × 2.5%) × Base pay OR Disability% × Base pay
- Generally taxable (except combat-related portions)
- Continues for life or until condition improves

*Types:*
- **Permanent Disability Retirement List (PDRL):** Stable conditions, permanent retirement
- **Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL):** Unstable conditions, re-evaluated every 18 months for up to 3 years

**Can you receive both?**

**Yes, but with limitations:**

Prior to 2004, you could not receive both full amounts (offset applied). Now:

**Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay (CRDP):**
- Available to military retirees with 20+ years of service AND 50%+ VA rating
- Allows you to receive both full military retirement and VA disability
- Phase-in completed; now receiving both without offset

**Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC):**
- Available to military retirees with combat-related disabilities
- Allows you to receive military retirement and a CRSC payment equal to the VA amount
- CRSC is tax-free
- Must apply through your branch of service

**If you don't qualify for CRDP or CRSC:**
- If you receive military retirement, VA disability is offset dollar-for-dollar
- You receive the higher of the two payments
- Effectively, you don't get both

**Medical separation vs. medical retirement:**

**Medical Separation:**
- DOD disability rating below 30%
- Found unfit for duty but doesn't qualify for retirement
- Receive severance pay (lump sum)
- Can still apply for VA disability (separate system)
- Severance pay may be recouped from VA disability pay

**Medical Retirement:**
- DOD disability rating 30% or higher, OR
- 20+ years of service regardless of rating
- Monthly retirement payments for life
- Can still apply for VA disability
- May receive both if eligible for CRDP/CRSC

**Example scenario:**

*Service Member A:*
- Medically retired from Army after 12 years
- DOD disability rating: 40%
- Military medical retirement: $2,000/month (taxable)
- Later awarded VA disability: 70% ($1,716/month, tax-free)
- Since doesn't have 20 years AND has less than 50% VA rating: Receives the higher amount ($2,000 military retirement) but VA disability is offset

*Service Member B:*
- Retired from Navy after 22 years
- Later awarded VA disability: 60%
- Has 20+ years AND 50%+ rating
- Qualifies for CRDP: Receives BOTH full military retirement and full VA disability

**Important distinctions:**

| Feature | VA Disability | Military Medical Retirement |
|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Who pays | Department of Veterans Affairs | Department of Defense |
| When applies | After separation | At medical discharge |
| Rating system | VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities | DOD/Military ratings |
| Minimum rating | 0% (no compensation) | 30% (for retirement) |
| Years of service required | None | None for medical; 20+ for regular |
| Taxable | No | Yes (mostly) |
| Based on | Severity of condition | Unfitness for duty |
| Must apply | Yes | Automatic if medically separated |

**Action items for transitioning service members:**

1. **Understand your DOD rating vs. future VA rating:** These use different rating systems and may differ significantly
2. **Apply for VA disability:** Even if medically retired, you must separately apply for VA disability
3. **Determine CRDP/CRSC eligibility:** Work with your finance office and VA
4. **Keep all medical records:** You'll need them for both DOD and VA processes
5. **Use BDD program:** File VA claim 90-180 days before separation
6. **Don't assume automatic VA rating:** Medical retirement doesn't guarantee VA compensation

The key takeaway: These are separate systems. Being medically retired by DOD doesn't automatically give you VA benefits, and having VA disability doesn't mean you'll get military medical retirement. You may qualify for both, one, or neither depending on your specific circumstances.

### Q012: Can I reopen a previously denied claim? {#q012}

**A:** Yes, you can reopen a denied claim by filing a Supplemental Claim with new and relevant evidence, and your effective date will be the date of your new claim, not your original filing date.

When the VA denies your claim, you have several options. Understanding which to use depends on timing and whether you have new evidence.

**Your options after a denial:**

**1. Supplemental Claim (most common for reopening)**

*When to use:*
- You have new and relevant evidence that wasn't in your original claim
- The 1-year appeal deadline has passed
- You want the VA to review your claim with fresh evidence

*What you need:*
- VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim)
- New and relevant evidence (medical records, nexus letter, buddy statements, etc.)
- The evidence must be information that wasn't in your original claim

*Effective date:*
- Date the VA receives your Supplemental Claim
- NOT retroactive to your original claim date
- This is a major difference from appeals

*Example:*
- Original claim filed: January 2022 (denied May 2022)
- Supplemental claim filed: March 2024
- New VA rating approved: September 2024
- Effective date: March 2024 (you receive back pay from March 2024, not January 2022)
- You lost 2 years of back pay by waiting

**2. Higher-Level Review**

*When to use:*
- You believe the VA made an error in your denial
- You're within 1 year of the decision
- You don't have new evidence

*What you need:*
- VA Form 20-0996
- Specific errors to point out in the review
- NO new evidence can be submitted

*Effective date:*
- Original claim date (if approved)

**3. Board Appeal**

*When to use:*
- You want a Veterans Law Judge to review your claim
- Within 1 year of decision
- You can choose evidence options

*What you need:*
- VA Form 10182 (Board Appeal)
- Choose your review lane: Direct Review, Evidence Submission, or Hearing

*Effective date:*
- Original claim date (if approved)

**What counts as "new and relevant" evidence:**

**New evidence:**
- Medical records from after your original claim
- Recent C&P exam from a private doctor
- A nexus letter from a medical professional
- Buddy statements from people who recently remembered events
- New diagnosis of your condition
- Evidence of worsening condition
- Research studies supporting your claim

**NOT new evidence:**
- The same records you already submitted
- Records that were available but you didn't submit (unless you can explain why)
- Just a different argument using the same facts

**Relevant evidence:**
- Directly relates to your claimed condition
- Could reasonably change the outcome
- Proves service connection, current diagnosis, or nexus

**Example of new and relevant evidence:**

*Denied for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD (2022):*
- Supplemental claim includes: New sleep study showing severe sleep apnea, new nexus letter from pulmonologist linking it to PTSD, treatment records from 2023-2024 showing ongoing CPAP use
- Result: Likely to be approved because evidence is both new (created after original claim) and relevant (proves current diagnosis and connection)

**Strategic considerations:**

**Timing matters:**
Don't wait years to file a supplemental claim. Every month you wait is a month of lost back pay.

If you're denied and need time to gather evidence:
1. File a Higher-Level Review immediately (within 1 year) to preserve your effective date
2. Simultaneously gather new evidence
3. If HLR is denied, file Supplemental Claim with new evidence

**Multiple denied claims:**
Some veterans have filed and been denied 3, 4, or 5 times for the same condition. Each time, if you have new evidence, you can file again. However:
- Each denial makes the next claim harder (VA assumes previous decisions were correct)
- You're losing years of back pay with each delay
- Consider working with a VSO or attorney after the first denial

**Common reasons for denials and how to fix them:**

| Denial Reason | How to Fix in Supplemental Claim |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| No current diagnosis | Get diagnosis from doctor, submit medical records |
| No service connection proven | Obtain nexus letter from medical professional |
| Insufficient evidence of in-service event | Submit buddy statements, service records, or research on presumptive conditions |
| Condition not severe enough for rating | Submit evidence of worsening, new functional impact statements |
| No nexus between service and condition | Get independent medical opinion (IMO) or nexus letter |

**PACT Act impact on denied claims:**

If you were previously denied for:
- Respiratory conditions
- Cancers
- Other conditions now presumptive under the PACT Act

AND you served in qualifying locations (burn pit exposure zones), file a supplemental claim immediately. Many veterans are getting previously denied claims approved without new medical evidence because the PACT Act changed the rules.

**How long do supplemental claims take:**

Processing time: Similar to original claims (120-150 days average)
- May be faster if evidence is clear and complete
- May be slower if additional exams are needed

**Can you file unlimited supplemental claims?**

Yes, there's no limit on how many times you can file a supplemental claim, as long as you have new evidence each time. However:
- It's not a strategy for success—fix the underlying evidence problem
- Each denial creates a stronger presumption the VA was correct
- You're losing potential back pay with each delay

**Bottom line:**

If your claim was denied:
1. **Understand why:** Read the decision letter carefully
2. **Within 1 year:** File HLR or Board Appeal if you think VA made an error (preserves effective date)
3. **After 1 year OR with new evidence:** File Supplemental Claim
4. **Get help:** Work with a VSO or attorney to identify what evidence is missing
5. **Don't give up:** Many conditions are eventually approved after 2-3 attempts with proper evidence

The most important factor: Don't wait. Every month of delay is lost compensation you'll never recover.

### Q013: How often does the VA re-evaluate my disability rating? {#q013}

**A:** The VA can schedule routine future exams (RFEs) to re-evaluate your condition, typically every 2-5 years for conditions expected to improve, but permanent and total (P&T) ratings and static conditions are generally not re-examined.

**Types of VA ratings and re-evaluation frequency:**

**1. Static ratings (not re-evaluated)**
- Conditions that are permanent and unlikely to improve
- Amputations, total hearing/vision loss, severe brain injuries
- Clearly documented as permanent in your rating decision
- The VA decision will state "static" if applicable

**2. Permanent and Total (P&T) ratings (rarely re-evaluated)**
- 100% disability rating
- Scheduler rating (not TDIU/IU)
- Decision indicates "permanent and total"
- Not subject to routine future exams
- Can still be reduced if fraud is discovered or significant improvement occurs

**3. Ratings subject to routine future exams (RFE)**
- Most ratings below 100%
- Conditions expected to improve over time
- Mental health conditions
- Service-connected conditions where improvement is medically possible

**Typical RFE timelines:**
- **2-5 years:** Most common interval
- **1-2 years:** Conditions with high likelihood of improvement
- **6-7 years:** Stable conditions with low likelihood of change
- **Protected ratings (10-20+ years):** See below

**What happens during a re-evaluation:**

1. **Notice:** VA sends you a letter scheduling a C&P re-examination (usually 30-60 days notice)

2. **Exam:** You attend a new C&P exam to assess current severity

3. **Decision:** VA reviews exam and either:
   - Maintains your current rating
   - Increases your rating (if condition worsened)
   - Decreases your rating (if condition improved)
   - Proposes a reduction (with due process)

**Important: If VA proposes to reduce your rating:**

You have rights and protections:
- VA must send a **proposal to reduce** letter first (not an immediate reduction)
- You have **60 days** to request a hearing or submit evidence of continued severity
- VA must prove your condition improved based on actual medical evidence
- If you've had the rating for 20+ years, reduction is very difficult (see protected ratings below)

**Protected ratings (harder to reduce):**

**5-year protection:**
- After holding a rating continuously for 5 years, VA must prove "sustained improvement" to reduce
- Can't reduce based on a single exam showing slight improvement
- Must show the improvement is stabilized and maintained over time

**10-year protection:**
- After 10 continuous years, VA cannot sever (completely remove) service connection
- Can still reduce the rating percentage, but cannot deny service connection altogether

**20-year protection:**
- After 20 continuous years, VA generally cannot reduce your rating except in rare cases (fraud, clear error)
- Provides the strongest protection

**Why the VA schedules re-evaluations:**

The VA's position is that disability compensation should reflect current severity. If your condition improves significantly, your compensation should decrease. If it worsens, your compensation should increase.

However, the system is controversial because:
- Many conditions worsen over time (aging, progression)
- Re-exams create anxiety and uncertainty for veterans
- Some examiners downplay symptoms
- Administrative burden on already-backlogged system

**How to protect yourself during re-evaluations:**

**Before the exam:**
1. **Review your file:** Know your current rating and symptoms documented in prior exams
2. **Gather evidence:** Collect recent medical records showing ongoing treatment and severity
3. **Document symptoms:** Keep a log of daily impact, bad days, limitations
4. **See your doctor:** Get recent appointments documenting persistent or worsening symptoms

**During the exam:**
1. **Be honest and specific:** Describe your worst days, not your best days
2. **Don't downplay symptoms:** C&P examiners are evaluating for potential reduction—be thorough
3. **Bring a witness:** Spouses or caregivers can provide observations
4. **Document:** Take notes on what was asked and how you answered

**After the exam:**
1. **Review the DBQ:** Request a copy of the examiner's report
2. **Submit rebuttal if inaccurate:** If the exam contains errors, submit corrections within 30 days
3. **Monitor your decision:** Check eBenefits for status updates

**What if you miss a re-evaluation exam?**

**Consequences:**
- VA may propose to reduce or discontinue your benefits
- Considered failure to report for exam
- Must have a **very good reason** to reschedule

**Valid reasons to reschedule:**
- Medical emergency or hospitalization
- Death in immediate family
- Severe weather or natural disaster
- No transportation (documented)

**How to reschedule:**
- Call VA immediately (number on appointment letter)
- Provide explanation and documentation
- Request new appointment ASAP

**How to avoid re-evaluations:**

**Seek a static or P&T rating:**
- Request your doctor document your condition as permanent and unlikely to improve
- Submit evidence that your condition is static
- Request a nexus letter stating the condition is permanent

**File for increases if worsening:**
- Don't wait for RFE—if your condition worsens, file for an increase immediately
- This resets the re-evaluation clock and may result in higher rating

**Veterans over age 55:**
- VA policy generally discourages RFEs for veterans over 55 unless substantial improvement is expected
- While not absolute protection, age is a factor in RFE scheduling

**Recent changes and trends:**

**COVID-19 impact:**
- Many routine exams were postponed during the pandemic
- Backlog of RFEs created delays in the system

**Rating modernization:**
- VA is updating rating criteria for certain conditions
- May trigger re-examinations even for older ratings

**Proactive re-evaluations:**
- Some veterans intentionally request re-evaluation if their condition worsened
- Can result in increased rating and back pay from request date

**Bottom line:**

- If you have a P&T or static rating, you likely won't face re-evaluation
- If you have a non-P&T rating, expect re-evaluation every 2-5 years
- Protected ratings (5, 10, 20 years) make reductions more difficult
- Always attend re-evaluation exams and take them seriously
- Submit evidence of continued severity proactively

If you're facing a proposed reduction, don't panic—you have rights and can fight it with medical evidence, VSO support, or legal help.

### Q014: What should I do while waiting for my claim decision? {#q014}

**A:** While waiting, continue medical treatment, document your symptoms, respond promptly to VA requests, check your claim status regularly, and avoid making major financial decisions based on anticipated ratings.

The average VA claim takes 140-150 days, which can feel like an eternity. Here's how to productively use that waiting period:

**1. Continue regular medical treatment**

**Why it matters:**
- Documents ongoing severity of your condition
- Shows treatment-seeking behavior (proves condition is serious)
- Creates medical records useful for future increases
- Establishes baseline for potential re-evaluations

**What to do:**
- Keep all scheduled appointments (VA or private)
- Seek treatment for all claimed conditions
- Document symptoms at each visit
- Ask providers to note specific limitations and functional impacts

**Don't make this mistake:**
Some veterans stop treatment thinking it might hurt their claim. Wrong. Regular treatment strengthens your case for ongoing severity.

**2. Respond immediately to VA requests**

**You may receive:**
- Requests for additional evidence
- C&P exam scheduling notices
- Authorization forms for private medical records
- Requests for clarification

**Time-sensitive actions:**
- **C&P exam notices:** Attend ALL exams on time. Missing an exam can result in denial.
- **Evidence requests:** Submit within the deadline (usually 30-60 days)
- **Phone calls from VA:** Answer or return calls promptly

**Track communications:**
- Save all letters from the VA
- Note phone conversations (date, time, person's name, what was discussed)
- Send documents via certified mail or upload through eBenefits with confirmation

**3. Check your claim status (but don't obsess)**

**How to check:**
- VA.gov: Log in and view "Track Claims" (most current)
- eBenefits: Check claim status tracker
- VA mobile app: Real-time updates
- Phone: 1-800-827-1000 (hold times can be long)

**What you'll see:**

The claim status tracker shows 8 steps:
1. Claim received
2. Initial review
3. Evidence gathering
4. Evidence review
5. Preparation for decision
6. Pending decision approval
7. Preparation for notification
8. Complete

**Important notes:**
- Steps may go backward (this is normal)
- Timeline estimates are often inaccurate
- Status may not update for weeks
- Don't panic if it seems stalled

**How often to check:**
- **Recommended:** Once per week
- **Not recommended:** Multiple times per day (it won't speed things up and increases anxiety)

**4. Document your symptoms**

Keep a daily or weekly journal documenting:
- Specific symptoms and severity (1-10 scale)
- Limitations on activities (can't stand for more than 30 minutes, can't lift over 20 lbs)
- Impact on work, family, social life
- Good days vs. bad days (focus on bad days)
- Medications and side effects
- Sleep quality

**Why this matters:**
- Useful if you need to file an appeal
- Helpful for future increase claims
- Evidence for secondary conditions
- Prepares you for potential additional exams

**5. Prepare for potential C&P exams**

**If you receive a C&P exam notice:**

*Before the exam:*
- Review all claimed conditions
- Review your service treatment records
- List all symptoms, even if they seem minor
- Identify how conditions limit your daily life
- Bring copies of recent medical records
- Bring medications (shows ongoing treatment)
- Consider bringing a spouse or witness

*During the exam:*
- Be honest and thorough—describe your worst days
- Answer all questions fully
- Don't minimize symptoms
- Explain how conditions interact
- Describe limitations specifically
- Stay calm and professional

*After the exam:*
- Take notes on what was discussed
- Request a copy of the DBQ (disability benefits questionnaire)
- Submit corrections if exam contains errors

**6. Stay informed but avoid misinformation**

**Good resources:**
- VA.gov official information
- Accredited VSO guidance
- VA's YouTube channel and webinars
- Reputable veteran advocacy organizations

**Avoid:**
- Facebook groups with unreliable advice
- Reddit speculation on timelines
- "Guaranteed rating increase" scams
- Overpriced "VA claim courses"

**Learning is helpful, but:**
- Every claim is unique—someone else's timeline doesn't predict yours
- Rating criteria are complex—don't self-diagnose your expected rating
- Comparing your situation to others creates unnecessary stress

**7. Don't make major financial decisions**

**Tempting but risky:**
- Borrowing money expecting back pay
- Quitting your job assuming you'll get 100% P&T
- Making large purchases based on anticipated rating
- Taking out loans against future compensation

**Why this is dangerous:**
- Claims can be denied
- Ratings may be lower than expected
- Processing times can extend beyond estimates
- Back pay amounts vary significantly

**Wait until:**
- You have a final decision letter
- You've verified your monthly compensation amount
- Payment has actually started

**8. Prepare for possible outcomes**

**If approved:**
- Review decision letter carefully
- Verify rating percentages are correct
- Check effective date
- Understand your appeal rights (1 year to appeal)
- Set up direct deposit if not already done
- File for any missing conditions

**If denied:**
- Read denial reasons thoroughly
- Don't panic—denials are common and often overturned
- Contact your VSO immediately
- Determine appeal strategy (HLR, Supplemental Claim, or Board Appeal)
- Gather missing evidence
- File appeal within 1 year to preserve effective date

**If partially approved:**
- Review which conditions were approved and which denied
- Check if ratings match expected severity
- Appeal denied conditions
- File for increase on low-rated conditions
- File for secondary conditions that may have been missed

**9. Address financial concerns**

**If facing financial hardship during processing:**
- Contact VA at 1-800-827-1000 to inquire about claim status
- Ask VSO about expedited processing for financial hardship
- Consider emergency assistance from veteran organizations
- Look into VA's Veterans Community Care program for healthcare
- Research state/local veteran benefits available while waiting

**10. Take care of your mental health**

The waiting period is stressful. It's normal to feel:
- Anxiety about the outcome
- Frustration with the timeline
- Anger at the system
- Hope mixed with fear

**Healthy coping:**
- Stay busy with work, hobbies, family
- Exercise and maintain routines
- Talk to fellow veterans who understand
- Seek counseling if needed (VA or private)
- Avoid obsessing over the claim

**When to contact VA during processing:**

**DO contact if:**
- You move and need to update your address
- You receive a request for evidence
- You want to add new conditions to pending claim
- You've been waiting over 200 days with no updates
- You missed a C&P exam and need to reschedule
- You have new evidence to submit

**DON'T contact asking:**
- "Where is my claim?" after only 30 days
- "Can you speed it up?" (unless hardship)

### Q015: Can I file a claim for a condition that started after service? {#q015}

**A:** Yes, you can file for conditions that appeared after service if they're secondary to a service-connected condition, caused by VA medical care, or are presumptive conditions that typically manifest years after exposure.

Many veterans mistakenly believe they can only claim conditions that showed symptoms while in service. This is incorrect. Here's when you can file for post-service conditions:

**1. Secondary service connection (most common post-service scenario)**

**What it is:**
A condition caused or aggravated by an already service-connected disability

**Example scenarios:**

*Knee injury → Back problems:*
- Service-connected: Right knee injury from parachute landing (2010)
- Secondary condition: Lower back pain from altered gait (developed 2018)
- Service connection: Back condition is secondary to service-connected knee

*PTSD → Sleep disorders:*
- Service-connected: PTSD from combat (2005)
- Secondary conditions: Insomnia and sleep apnea (developed 2015-2020)
- Service connection: Sleep disorders secondary to PTSD

*Mental health → Physical conditions:*
- Service-connected: Anxiety disorder
- Secondary conditions: IBS, hypertension, chronic headaches
- Service connection: Physical manifestations of mental health condition

**Requirements for secondary claims:**
- Current diagnosis of secondary condition
- Established service-connected primary condition
- Medical nexus linking secondary to primary (usually requires nexus letter)

**2. Presumptive conditions (delayed manifestation)**

**What it is:**
Certain conditions the VA presumes are service-connected if they appear within specific time frames after exposure, even decades later

**Agent Orange presumptives:**
- Can develop 20-50+ years after service
- Vietnam veterans: Type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, many others
- No time limit on when condition appears

**PACT Act burn pit presumptives:**
- Respiratory conditions, cancers
- Can manifest 10-30+ years after exposure
- Presumed if you served in qualifying locations since 1990

**Radiation exposure presumptives:**
- Various cancers
- Can appear decades after exposure

**Gulf War presumptives:**
- Chronic multisymptom illness
- Must manifest to degree of 10% or more within prescribed time period (varies by condition)

**3. Conditions caused by VA medical treatment**

**What it is:**
Injuries or illnesses that resulted from VA medical care

**Examples:**
- Infection from VA surgery
- Medication side effects causing new condition
- Misdiagnosis leading to condition worsening
- Surgical complications

**Requirements:**
- Must prove VA care caused the condition
- Need medical evidence linking VA treatment to injury
- File VA tort claim in addition to disability claim

**4. Conditions aggravated by service-connected conditions**

**What it is:**
Pre-existing conditions that worsened due to service-connected disabilities

**Example:**
- Pre-service diabetes (not service-connected)
- Service-connected lower extremity amputation
- Diabetes worsens significantly due to limitations from amputation
- Claim: Aggravation of diabetes secondary to service-connected amputation

**5. Late-manifesting combat conditions**

**What it is:**
Certain chronic conditions that appeared after service but are presumed related to combat

**Requirements:**
- Combat veteran
- Condition developed to compensable degree within 1 year of separation (for most conditions)
- Conditions include: hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular-renal disease (various sub-conditions)

**How long after service can you file?**

**There is no time limit** to file a VA disability claim. You can file:
- 5 years after service
- 10 years after service
- 30 years after service
- 50+ years after service

**However:**
- Your effective date is the date you file, not when the condition started
- The longer you wait, the harder it may be to gather evidence
- You lose potential back pay for years you waited

**Example:**
Vietnam veteran files for Type 2 diabetes in 2024 (50+ years after service). Claim is approved because diabetes is an Agent Orange presumptive. Effective date is 2024, not when diabetes was first diagnosed in 2005. He lost 19 years of compensation by waiting.

**Evidence requirements for post-service conditions:**

**For secondary conditions:**
1. **Current diagnosis:** Medical records showing secondary condition
2. **Primary service connection:** Evidence of existing service-connected condition
3. **Nexus:** Medical opinion linking secondary to primary

*Most critical: Nexus letter*
- From qualified medical professional (MD, DO, PA, NP, PhD psychologist)
- States "at least as likely as not" (50%+) secondary condition is caused by primary
- Provides medical rationale for connection
- References medical records and research

**For presumptive conditions:**
1. **Current diagnosis:** Documented condition
2. **Service in qualifying location/time:** DD-214 or service records
3. **No nexus needed:** Presumption does the work for you

**Common mistakes when filing post-service conditions:**

**Mistake 1: Assuming you can't file because it started after service**
- Incorrect. File if there's any potential service connection (especially secondary)

**Mistake 2: Not filing for obvious secondary conditions**
- Example: Have service-connected knee injury but never filed for resulting back pain
- You're leaving money on the table

**Mistake 3: Filing without nexus evidence for secondary claims**
- VA may deny for lack of nexus
- Get nexus letter before filing, or submit as Supplemental Claim

**Mistake 4: Waiting too long to file**
- Every year you wait is lost compensation
- File as soon as diagnosed

**Mistake 5: Not understanding presumptive conditions**
- Veterans entitled to presumptive service connection never file because they don't know
- Research your presumptives (Agent Orange, burn pits, radiation, etc.)

**How to file for post-service conditions:**

**Process is the same as any claim:**
1. Submit VA Form 21-526EZ
2. List condition(s)
3. Specify type: Secondary to [primary condition] OR Presumptive based on [exposure]
4. Provide medical evidence and nexus (for secondary) or proof of service in qualifying location (for presumptive)
5. Attend C&P exam if scheduled

**Strategic approach:**

**If you have a service-connected condition, review for secondaries:**
- Mental health → Sleep disorders, IBS, cardiovascular, chronic pain
- Back/neck injuries → Radiculopathy, headaches, gait abnormalities
- Knee/hip/ankle → Back problems, opposite leg issues
- Tinnitus → Insomnia, headaches, mental health issues
- PTSD → Substance abuse, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders

**If you served in qualifying locations, research presumptives:**
- Vietnam → Agent Orange presumptives (diabetes, heart disease, cancers, neuropathy)
- Gulf War/Post-9/11 → Burn pit presumptives (respiratory, cancers)
- Specific locations → Radiation, herbicide exposure

**If a condition appeared 20-30 years after service:**
- Don't assume it's too late
- Research if it's a known presumptive
- File immediately upon diagnosis

**Bottom line:**

Don't let the fact that a condition appeared after service stop you from filing. Many legitimate service-connected conditions don't manifest until years or decades later. Research secondary connections and presumptive conditions, gather proper evidence (especially nexus letters for secondaries), and file as soon as you're diagnosed.

The worst that happens is a denial—which you can appeal with more evidence. The best that happens is approval and compensation for a condition you thought wasn't service-connected.

### Q016: What is the difference between a VA claim and a VA appeal? {#q016}

**A:** A VA claim is your initial request for disability benefits, while a VA appeal is a challenge to a VA decision you disagree with, filed through the new Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decision review process.

Understanding this distinction is crucial because the process, timelines, and strategies differ significantly.

**VA CLAIM (Initial Request):**

**Purpose:** Request VA disability compensation for service-connected conditions

**When filed:**
- First time claiming a condition
- Adding new conditions to existing service connection
- Requesting an increase in current rating
- Reopening a previously denied claim with new evidence (Supplemental Claim)

**Forms:**
- VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation)
- VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File)

**Process:**
1. Submit application with evidence
2. VA gathers additional evidence
3. VA schedules C&P exam(s)
4. VA issues rating decision
5. Compensation begins (if approved)

**Timeline:** Average 140-150 days

**Outcome:** Approval (with rating %), partial approval, or denial

**Your rights after decision:**
- Accept the decision
- File for increase if rating too low
- Appeal if denied or disagree with rating

---

**VA APPEAL (Challenge to Decision):**

**Purpose:** Challenge a VA decision you believe is incorrect

**When filed:**
- You disagree with a denial
- You believe your rating is too low
- VA made an error in their decision
- New evidence shows decision was wrong

**Forms (depends on appeal type):**
- VA Form 20-0996 (Higher-Level Review)
- VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim)
- VA Form 10182 (Board Appeal)

**Three appeal options under AMA:**

**1. Higher-Level Review (HLR)**
- Senior reviewer examines same evidence
- Looks for errors in original decision
- **No new evidence** allowed
- Faster timeline: 125 days average
- If approved, effective date = original claim date

**2. Supplemental Claim**
- File with **new and relevant evidence**
- Fresh review with additional evidence
- Timeline: Similar to initial claim (140+ days)
- If approved, effective date = date of supplemental claim (not original)

**3. Board Appeal**
- Veterans Law Judge reviews case
- Choose from 3 dockets:
  - Direct Review (no new evidence, no hearing)
  - Evidence Submission (submit new evidence)
  - Hearing (testify before judge)
- Longest timeline: 1-3+ years depending on docket
- If approved, effective date = original claim date

**Timeline:** Varies widely (4 months to 3+ years)

**Outcome:**
- Grant (overturn denial or increase rating)
- Deny (uphold original decision)
- Remand (send back for additional development)

---

**KEY DIFFERENCES:**

| Feature | VA Claim | VA Appeal |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Request new benefits | Challenge a decision |
| **When used** | First time or adding conditions | After receiving decision |
| **Evidence** | Submit all available evidence | Depends on appeal type |
| **Form** | 21-526EZ | 20-0996, 20-0995, or 10182 |
| **Deadline** | No deadline (file anytime) | 1 year from decision for HLR/Board; anytime for Supplemental |
| **Effective date** | Date claim received | Original date (HLR/Board) or new date (Supplemental) |
| **Processing time** | 140-150 days average | 125 days to 3+ years |

---

**Example scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: First-time claim**
- Action: File **VA Claim** (21-526EZ)
- Process: Submit evidence → C&P exam → Decision
- Outcome: Approved at 30% for back pain
- Next step: Accept decision OR appeal if too low

**Scenario 2: Denied claim with no new evidence**
- Original claim: Denied for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD
- Why denied: Examiner said no connection between PTSD and sleep apnea
- Action: File **Higher-Level Review** (20-0996)
- Argument: Examiner's conclusion contradicts medical research; original decision was an error
- Outcome: HLR grants, reverses denial, awards 50% rating
- Effective date: Original claim date (back pay preserved)

**Scenario 3: Denied claim with new evidence**
- Original claim: Denied for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD (lacked nexus letter)
- Action: Get nexus letter from private doctor, then file **Supplemental Claim** (20-0995)
- Outcome: Approved with new evidence
- Effective date: Date supplemental claim filed (lost back pay from original date)

**Scenario 4: Rating too low**
- Original claim: Approved at 10% for tinnitus, but veteran believes should be higher
- Action: File **Board Appeal** (10182) OR file new **claim for increase** (21-526EZ)
- Note: Filing for increase might be faster than Board Appeal

---

**Which should you file?**

**File a CLAIM when:**
- First time claiming a condition
- Adding new conditions not previously claimed
- Requesting increase for worsening condition
- More than 1 year has passed since denial
- Have new evidence for previously denied condition (file Supplemental Claim)

**File an APPEAL when:**
- Recently received an unfavorable decision (within 1 year)
- Disagree with denial or rating
- Believe VA made an error
- Want to preserve original effective date

---

**Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) - Important Changes:**

**Before AMA (Legacy system - pre-Feb 2019):**
- One appeal lane
- Multi-year timelines
- Complex process with many stages

**After AMA (Current system - Feb 2019+):**
- Three appeal options (HLR, Supplemental, Board)
- Clearer timelines
- Can switch lanes or file multiple options
- Veterans have more flexibility

**Legacy appeals still in system:**
Veterans with appeals filed before Feb 2019 can:
- Continue in legacy system
- Opt-in to new AMA system (usually faster)

---

**Common mistakes:**

**Mistake 1: Filing an appeal when you should file a claim**
- Example: Want to add a new condition (file claim, not appeal)

**Mistake 2: Filing Supplemental Claim instead of HLR**
- If VA made an error and you have no new evidence, HLR preserves effective date
- Supplemental Claim loses original effective date

**Mistake 3: Missing the 1-year deadline for HLR or Board Appeal**
- After 1 year, only option is Supplemental Claim with new evidence
- Lose ability to preserve original effective date

**Mistake 4: Not understanding evidence rules**
- HLR: No new evidence allowed
- Supplemental: Must have new evidence
- Board: Depends on docket chosen

**Mistake 5: Filing appeals without VSO/attorney help**
- Appeals are more complex than initial claims
- Errors can result in years of delays
- Professional help is especially valuable for appeals

---

**Bottom line:**

- **Claim** = asking for benefits (first time or adding to existing)
- **Appeal** = challenging a decision you disagree with

Know which one you need based on your situation, understand the three appeal options under AMA, and file the right form within the right timeline to preserve your effective date and maximize your benefits.

If you're unsure, consult a VSO before filing. Using the wrong form or process can cost you years of back pay.

### Q017: Can I get disability compensation for my pre-service condition? {#q017}

**A:** Generally no, unless your pre-service condition was permanently aggravated (worsened beyond its natural progression) by military service, in which case you can receive compensation for the degree of aggravation.

Pre-existing conditions complicate VA disability claims, but you may still qualify in specific circumstances.

**The general rule:**

The VA will not compensate for disabilities that existed before service UNLESS:
1. The condition was **aggravated (permanently worsened)** by service beyond its natural progression, OR
2. The condition was **incurred in the line of duty** during service

**What "aggravated beyond natural progression" means:**

**Natural progression:** How a condition would have worsened on its own with time and age

**Aggravation:** The condition got worse **because of military service**, beyond how it would have naturally progressed

**Example:**
- Pre-service: Mild asthma, controlled with occasional inhaler
- During service: Exposed to burn pits, sand, and harsh conditions
- Post-service: Severe chronic asthma requiring daily medications and hospitalizations
- Claim: Asthma aggravated by service beyond natural progression
- Result: May be service-connected for the **degree of aggravation** (difference between pre-service severity and current severity)

**VA's presumption of soundness:**

**Important legal protection for veterans:**

If you entered service with a pre-existing condition but it wasn't noted as disqualifying at entry, the VA presumes you were "sound" (healthy) when you entered. The VA must prove with "clear and unmistable evidence" that:
1. The condition existed before service, AND
2. It was not aggravated by service

This presumption helps veterans because it shifts the burden to the VA to prove the condition wasn't aggravated.

**How the VA handles pre-service conditions:**

**Step 1: Determine if condition existed before service**
- Review entrance exam (DD Form 2807-1 and 2808)
- Review enlistment physical
- Review pre-service medical records

**Step 2: Determine if condition was noted at entry**
- If noted and waived: VA knows it pre-existed
- If not noted: Presumption of soundness applies

**Step 3: Evaluate aggravation**
- Compare severity at entry vs. during service vs. current
- Determine if worsening was due to service or natural progression
- C&P examiner provides opinion on aggravation

**Step 4: Rate the degree of aggravation**
- If aggravated, VA rates the current severity minus the baseline pre-service severity
- You're compensated for the difference (degree of aggravation)

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Knee condition aggravated**
- Pre-service: Previous knee surgery in high school from sports injury, 90% healed
- Entrance exam: Knee noted, condition waived for entry
- During service: Airborne training and ruck marches worsened knee significantly
- Post-service: Degenerative knee condition requiring eventual replacement
- **Claim:** Service aggravated pre-existing knee beyond natural progression
- **Rating:** Evaluated based on current severity minus pre-service baseline
- **Result:** Service-connected for degree of aggravation (might be rated 20-30% for current severity vs. 0-10% pre-service)

**Example 2: Asthma aggravated**
- Pre-service: Mild childhood asthma, rarely symptomatic as adult
- Entrance exam: Asthma NOT noted (veteran forgot to mention)
- During service: Burn pit exposure caused severe worsening
- **Claim:** Asthma aggravated by service
- **Presumption of soundness:** Applies because asthma wasn't noted
- **VA must prove:** Clear and unmistakable evidence asthma existed AND wasn't aggravated
- **Result:** Harder for VA to deny; presumption favors veteran

**Example 3: Pre-service condition NOT aggravated**
- Pre-service: Type 1 diabetes diagnosed at age 10
- Entrance exam: Diabetes noted and waived for entry (rare)
- During service: Diabetes managed, no change in severity
- Post-service: Diabetes continues with typical progression
- **Claim:** Diabetes service-connected
- **Result:** Likely denied—no evidence of aggravation beyond natural progression

**Common pre-service conditions claimed:**

- Asthma
- Knee/back injuries from pre-service sports or accidents
- Mental health conditions (anxiety, depression)
- Hearing loss (pre-service noise exposure)
- Skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis)
- Vision issues
- Previous fractures/orthopedic issues

**Evidence needed to prove aggravation:**

**1. Pre-service medical records**
- Document baseline severity before service
- Show pre-service treatment and symptoms

**2. Service treatment records (STRs)**
- Document in-service worsening
- Show increased treatment frequency or severity
- Note any specific incidents that aggravated condition

**3. Current medical records**
- Document current severity
- Show ongoing treatment and symptoms

**4. Nexus letter (medical opinion)**
- Physician compares pre-service baseline to current severity
- States "at least as likely as not" service aggravated condition beyond natural progression
- Provides medical rationale for aggravation

**5. Lay evidence**
- Buddy statements noting worsening during service
- Personal statement describing symptom changes

**How aggravation is rated:**

The VA rates **current severity** but considers **pre-service baseline**.

**Example:**
- Current knee disability: Would rate 30% based on current limitations
- Pre-service knee severity: Would have rated 10% if rated at that time
- **Service-connected rating: 20%** (current 30% minus pre-service 10%)
- Monthly compensation based on 20% rating

**Special case: Temporary aggravation**

If a pre-service condition temporarily worsened during service but returned to baseline after separation, it's generally NOT compensable.

**Example:**
- Pre-service: Mild seasonal allergies
- During service: Allergies worsened due to desert deployment
- Post-service: Allergies returned to pre-service mild level
- **Result:** Not service-connected (temporary aggravation)

**What if you didn't disclose the condition at entry?**

**Fraudulent enlistment concerns:**

Some veterans worry that if they didn't disclose a pre-service condition, they'll be accused of fraudulent enlistment.

**Reality:**
- VA generally doesn't pursue fraudulent enlistment for undisclosed conditions
- Presumption of soundness protects you if condition wasn't noted
- Focus is on whether condition was aggravated, not why you didn't disclose

**However:**
- Deliberately hiding a serious disqualifying condition could be problematic
- Be honest in your current claim—lying now can result in denial or fraud charges

**Common mistakes:**

**Mistake 1: Not filing because condition pre-existed**
- Many veterans assume pre-service conditions can never be service-connected
- Wrong—aggravation claims are legitimate and often approved

**Mistake 2: Failing to gather pre-service records**
- Without baseline documentation, VA can't determine degree of aggravation
- Get civilian medical records from before service

**Mistake 3: Not getting a nexus letter**
- Aggravation claims almost always require medical opinion
- Physician must compare baseline to current and attribute worsening to service

**Mistake 4: Claiming only the aggravated portion**
- File for the full current condition, noting pre-service history
- VA will determine the degree of aggravation
- Don't try to rate it yourself

**Bottom line:**

Pre-service conditions CAN be service-connected if they were aggravated by service beyond their natural progression. To succeed:

1. Gather pre-service medical records (baseline)
2. Gather service treatment records (in-service worsening)
3. Document current severity
4. Get a nexus letter from a physician explaining aggravation
5. File your claim, noting the pre-service history honestly
6. Let the VA determine the degree of aggravation

Don't assume a pre-service condition disqualifies you. Many veterans successfully get aggravation claims approved and receive compensation for the service-related worsening of their pre-existing conditions.

- **Before filing:** Ideal—allows you to review evidence and file Fully Developed Claim
- **After filing:** Still helpful for Supplemental Claims or appeals

**How to submit with claim:**
- Upload through VA.gov when filing online
- Mail with paper application
- Give to VSO to upload
- VA will also request records, but having them speeds up your claim

**Common problems and solutions:**

**Problem: Records are incomplete or missing**
- Solution: Request specific records by date or provider
- Request c from multiple VA facilities if you've used different centers

**Problem: Records are incorrect or inaccurate**
- Solution: Request corrections through VA facility
- Submit personal statement clarifying inaccuracies
- Get independent medical opinion if needed

**Problem: Can't access My HealtheVet**
- Solution: Call 1-877-327-0022 for My HealtheVet help desk
- Set up account in-person at VA facility
- Use alternative methods (ROI office)

**Problem: Records take too long**
- Solution: File Intent to File to preserve effective date
- Request expedited processing (if eligible)
- Consider filing claim and submitting records later (less ideal)

**Tips for organizing records:**

**Create organized folders:**
- By condition (back pain, PTSD, tinnitus, etc.)
- By date (chronological)
- By type (C&P exams, treatment notes, test results)

**Highlight key information:**
- Diagnoses
- Statements about severity or functional limitations
- References to service connection

**Create a timeline:**
- Document when symptoms started
- Note major treatments or events
- Show progression over time

**Bottom line:**

Getting your VA medical records is essential for a strong claim. Use My HealtheVet Blue Button for quick access to recent records, request complete records from your VA facility's ROI office for comprehensive documentation, and don't forget to also obtain service treatment records and private medical records if applicable.

Start the records request process early—before you file your claim if possible—and organize everything by condition to make your claim as strong as possible.

### Q019: What is a VA regional office and do I need to visit one? {#q019}

**A:** A VA Regional Office (VARO) is a local VA facility that processes disability claims, provides benefits counseling, and offers veterans services, but you generally don't need to visit one as most claims can be filed and managed online or with a VSO's help.

**What VA Regional Offices do:**

**Primary functions:**
1. **Process disability compensation claims**
   - Review applications
   - Request medical evidence
   - Schedule C&P exams
   - Issue rating decisions

2. **Provide benefits counseling**
   - Education benefits
   - Home loan assistance
   - Vocational rehabilitation
   - Life insurance

3. **Host Veterans Service Officers (VSOs)**
   - Free claims assistance
   - In-person appointments
   - Help with appeals

4. **Process other benefits**
   - Pension claims
   - Dependency claims
   - Burial benefits
   - Appeals

**What VA Regional Offices are NOT:**

- **Not medical facilities:** They don't provide healthcare (that's VA Medical Centers)
- **Not walk-in claim centers:** Most claims are filed online, not in person
- **Not emergency services:** For urgent help, contact VA crisis line or local VA medical center

**Do you need to visit a VA Regional Office?**

**Usually, NO:**

**Most veterans never need to visit a VARO** because:
- Claims can be filed online (va.gov)
- VSOs can be met at other locations (county offices, veteran centers, VFW halls)
- Phone and online support handles most needs
- Mail and upload options available

**When you MIGHT visit:**

**1. In-person VSO appointment**
- Some VSOs have offices inside VAR

Os
- Can meet face-to-face to discuss claim
- Bring documents and questions

**2. Benefits counseling**
- Want in-person help understanding benefits
- Complex situations requiring face-to-face discussion

**3. Homeless veteran services**
- Many VAROs have homeless veteran coordinators
- Walk-in assistance available

**4. Complicated issues**
- After multiple denials and appeals
- Need to speak with decision-makers directly (rare)

**5. Hearings**
- If you requested a hearing for your appeal
- Board of Veterans' Appeals video conference hearings held at VAROs

**What to expect if you visit:**

**Security:**
- Government building with security screening
- Bring photo ID
- Allow extra time for security

**Services:**
- Front desk can direct you to specific offices
- Benefits counselors available (sometimes by appointment)
- VSO offices typically require appointment

**Wait times:**
- Can be long without appointment
- Schedule in advance when possible

**How to find your VA Regional Office:**

**Online:**
- VA facility locator: va.gov/find-locations
- Filter by "VA benefits" or "Regional office"

**By phone:**
- Call 1-800-827-1000
- Ask for nearest regional office

**There are 56 VA Regional Offices** across the United States and territories:

**Major VA Regional Offices:**
- Atlanta, GA
- Baltimore, MD
- Boston, MA
- Chicago, IL
- Cleveland, OH
- Denver, CO
- Detroit, MI
- Honolulu, HI

- Los Angeles, CA
- New York, NY
- Philadelphia, PA
- Phoenix, AZ
- Portland, OR
- San Diego, CA
- Seattle, WA
- St. Louis, MO
- St. Petersburg, FL
- Washington, DC

**Plus dozens more** in smaller cities and states

**Which VARO processes your claim?**

**Usually based on your mailing address:**
- Claim is assigned to VARO responsible for your region
- You can file from anywhere—doesn't matter where you are physically
- Processing happens at your assigned VARO

**Note:** You can't choose which VARO processes your claim. It's assigned based on your address.

**VARO processing times vary:**

**Some VAROs are faster than others:**
- Some average 100 days
- Others average 180+ days
- Depends on staffing, backlog, and complexity of claims in that region

**Can you transfer your claim to a faster VARO?**
- No—changing your address for this purpose isn't allowed
- Your claim stays with the VARO assigned to your residence

**Alternatives to visiting a VARO:**

**1. File online (BEST for most veterans)**
- VA.gov: File claims, check status, upload documents
- My HealtheVet: Access medical records
- eBenefits: Manage benefits (being phased out, migrating to VA.gov)

**2. Call VA**
- General info: 1-800-827-1000 (Monday-Friday, 8am-9pm ET)
- Hearing impaired: TTY 1-800-829-4833
- Can check claim status, ask questions, request help

**3. Meet VSO at local office**
- County/state veteran service offices
- VFW, American Legion, DAV posts
- Community locations (not just VAROs)

**4. VA.gov virtual appointments**
- Video calls for some services
- Easier than in-person visits

**5. Mail**
- Submit forms and documents via mail
- Slower than online, but works

**What services require in-person visits?**

**Few services now require in-person:**
- **C&P exams:** Usually at VA medical center, contract provider, or VARO
- **Hearings:** If you requested Board Appeal hearing (video or in-person)
- **Some homeless services:** Walk-in assistance

**Most services are now remote:**
- Filing claims: Online
- Checking status: Online or phone
- Submitting evidence: Upload online
- VSO meetings: Phone, video, or local offices
- Appeals: Filed online or by mail

**COVID-19 impact:**

**VAROs shifted to remote work:**
- Many services now permanently remote
- Virtual appointments expanded
- Walk-in services reduced
- Online filing encouraged

**This is a GOOD thing for most veterans:**
- Faster, easier access from home
- No travel required
- 24/7 online access vs. limited office hours

**Common misconceptions:**

**Misconception 1: "I have to visit the VARO to file my claim"**
- False. File online, by mail, or with VSO help remotely

**Misconception 2: "Visiting in person speeds up my claim"**
- False. In-person filing doesn't prioritize your claim
- Online filing is often faster (immediate confirmation)

**Misconception 3: "I can go to any VARO"**
- Technically yes, but you'll be served by the VARO assigned to your address
- Visiting a different VARO won't change processing location

**Misconception 4: "VARO staff can tell me my rating decision"**
- False. You receive decisions via decision letter
- VARO staff usually can't access decision details before you receive the letter

**When to contact your VARO directly:**

**Rare situations:**
- Your VSO can't resolve an issue
- Your claim has been pending for 12+ months with no updates
- You believe there's an error in your claim processing (missing documents, incorrect assignment)
- You need to request an in-person hearing

**How to contact:**
- Call general number: 1-800-827-1000
- Ask to be transferred to your regional office
- Explain situation and ask for assistance

**Bottom line:**

VA Regional Offices exist and process your claim, but you rarely need to visit one. File claims online through VA.gov, work with a VSO at a convenient local location, manage everything from home using digital tools, and save in-person VARO visits for rare situations where remote options don't work.

The VA has modernized significantly—take advantage of online services for convenience and efficiency.

### Q020: Can I file for my dependents to receive additional benefits? {#q020}

**A:** Yes, if you have a VA disability rating of 30% or higher, you can add dependents (spouse, children, or dependent parents) to receive additional monthly compensation, and you should file VA Form 21-686c to add them.

**Eligibility for dependent benefits:**

**Rating requirement:**
- Must have at least **30% VA disability rating**
- 10% and 20% ratings don't qualify for additional dependent pay

**Qualifying dependents:**

**1. Spouse**
- Legally married (including same-sex marriage)
- Common-law marriage (if recognized by state)
- Can include step-children from spouse's previous relationships

**2. Children**
- Biological children under 18
- Adopted children under 18
- Stepchildren under 18 (if living with you)
- Children age 18-23 if attending school full-time
- Children of any age if permanently incapable of self-support due to disability before age 18

**3. Dependent parents**
- Your biological, adoptive, or step-parents
- Must be financially dependent on you (income below a threshold)

**How much additional compensation for dependents (2024 rates):**

**Example for 30% rating:**
- Veteran alone: $524.31/month
- Veteran with spouse: $577.31/month (+$53)
- Veteran with spouse and 1 child: $616.31/month (+$39 for child)
- Veteran with spouse and 2 children: $653.31/month (+$37 for 2nd child)

**Example for 100% rating:**
- Veteran alone: $3,737.85/month
- Veteran with spouse: $3,95 4.10/month (+$216.25)
- Veteran with spouse and 1 child: $4,058.59/month (+$104.49 for child)
- Veteran with spouse and 2 children: $4,161.68/month (+$103.09 for 2nd child)

**Higher ratings = More additional compensation for dependents**

**Full 2024 rate tables available at:** va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates

**How to add dependents:**

**Form to file:**
**VA Form 21-686c** (Declaration of Status of Dependents)

**When to file:**
- When you get married
- When you have or adopt a child
- When a child turns 18 and enrolls in college
- When you become responsible for a dependent parent
- When awarded 30%+ rating (if previously below 30%)

**How to file:**

**Online (fastest):**
- Log into VA.gov
- Go to "Add or remove a dependent"
- Complete digital form
- Upload supporting documents
- Submit

**By mail:**
- Download VA Form 21-686c: va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c
- Complete and sign
- Mail with supporting documents to your regional office

**Through VSO:**
- VSO can help complete and submit
- Can upload on your behalf

**Required documents:**

**For spouse:**
- Marriage certificate
- Spouse's social security number
- Spouse's date of birth
- Marriage date
- If previously married: Divorce decree or death certificate of former spouse

**For children:**
- Birth certificate or adoption papers
- Child's social security number
- For stepchildren: Marriage certificate to child's parent
- For disabled adult children: Medical evidence of disability

**For school-age children (18-23):**
- Proof of full-time enrollment (letter from school, transcript)
- School name and address
- Expected graduation date
- Must be enrolled full-time (as defined by the school)

**For dependent parents:**
- Parent's income and net worth information (VA Form 21P-509)
- Evidence of financial dependency
- Parent's social security number and date of birth

**Processing time:**

**Typical timeline:**
- Online submission: 2-4 weeks
- Mail submission: 4-8 weeks

**When benefits start:**
- Effective date is generally the date VA receives the claim
- If filed within 1 year of marriage, birth, or adoption: Effective date can be the date of the event

**Example:**
- You get married on June 1, 2024
- You file Form 21-686c on August 15, 2024 (within 1 year)
- Effective date: June 1, 2024 (you'll receive back pay for June-August)

**If you file after 1 year:**
- Effective date: Date VA receives your claim (no back pay to event date)

**Important rules and situations:**

**Both spouses are veterans with VA disability:**
- If both you and your spouse are veterans rated 30%+, you can BOTH claim each other as dependents
- Example: Husband 50% + Wife 40% = Both receive spouse increases on their own claims
- You can BOTH claim the same children as dependents

**Divorce or separation:**
- You MUST notify VA immediately when divorced or separated
- Failure to report can result in overpayment and recoupment
- File VA Form 21-686c to remove dependent

**Child turns 18:**
- Benefits automatically stop unless child enrolls in school full-time
- File VA Form 21-686c with school enrollment proof to continue benefits
- Must re-certify enrollment annually

**Child turns 23 or graduates:**
- Benefits stop when child turns 23 or graduates (whichever comes first)
- No extension beyond age 23

**Remarriage:**
- If you remarry, file VA Form 21-686c to add new spouse
- Must provide divorce decree from previous marriage

**Death of dependent:**
- Notify VA to remove dependent from your benefits
- Prevents overpayment

**Common mistakes:**

**Mistake 1: Not adding dependents**
- Many veterans don't know they qualify for additional pay
- You leave money on the table every month

**Mistake 2: Waiting too long to file**
- File within 1 year of marriage/birth to get back pay to the event
- After 1 year, only get back pay from filing date

**Mistake 3: Not updating when dependents change**
- Divorce, child turning 18, child graduating—all require updates
- Failure to report can result in overpayments you'll have to repay

**Mistake 4: Assuming child benefits continue automatically at 18**
- They don't—you must file school enrollment proof

**Mistake 5: Not claiming both spouses when both are veterans**
- If both spouses are veterans rated 30%+, both can claim each other

**Aid and Attendance additional benefits:**

**If your spouse needs help with daily living:**
- **Aid and Attendance (A&A):** Additional compensation if spouse is bedridden, blind, or needs daily assistance
- **Housebound:** If spouse is substantially confined to home

**Monthly increases (varies by rating):**
- Aid and Attendance for spouse: $57 to $191/month additional
- Housebound spouse: $47 to $157/month additional

**To claim:**
- File VA Form 21-2680 (Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance)
- Provide medical evidence

**Dependent parent benefits:**

**Less common, but available:**
- Parents must be financially dependent on you
- Must provide VA Form 21P-509 (Income and Asset Statement)
- VA determines dependency based on income thresholds

**Amount:**
- Varies based on parent's income
- Can be $300-700/month per dependent parent

**What if you have a rating below 30%?**

**You don't currently qualify for dependent benefits, but:**
- If your rating increases to 30%+, file VA Form 21-686c immediately
- If you file for increase and are granted 30%+, add dependents at that time
- Effective date for dependents will be the date your rating increased to 30%+

**Bottom line:**

If you're rated 30% or higher and have a spouse, children, or dependent parents, file VA Form 21-686c to add them and receive additional monthly compensation. Do this as soon as possible after marriage, birth, adoption, or reaching 30% rating to maximize your back pay. Remember to update the VA whenever your dependent status changes to avoid overpayments.

This is often-overlooked money that veterans are entitled to—don't leave hundreds of dollars per month on the table.

## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS (Q021-Q040)

### Q021: What evidence do I need to prove service connection? {#q021}

**A:** To prove service connection, you need three types of evidence: a current medical diagnosis of your condition, evidence of an in-service event/injury/illness, and a medical nexus linking your current condition to your military service.

This is known as the **"Three-Element Test"** for service connection:

**Element 1: Current Diagnosis**

**What you need:**
- Medical documentation of your current condition
- Must be an actual diagnosis from a qualified healthcare provider
- Self-diagnosis or symptoms alone aren't sufficient

**Acceptable sources:**
- VA medical records with diagnosis
- Private doctor's diagnosis
- C&P exam diagnosis
- Hospital records
- Specialist evaluations

**Examples:**
- "Patient diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)" ✓
- "Patient reports anxiety symptoms" ✗ (symptoms, not diagnosis)
- "Degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine" ✓
- "Patient complains of back pain" ✗ (complaint, not diagnosis)

**What if you don't have a current diagnosis?**
- See a doctor before filing your claim
- Get examined and diagnosed
- If you can't afford a doctor, file your claim and the VA will provide a C&P exam
- However, having a diagnosis before filing strengthens your claim

---

**Element 2: In-Service Event, Injury, or Illness**

**What you need:**
- Evidence that something happened during your military service that caused or contributed to your condition

**Types of in-service evidence:**

**Direct in-service injury:**
- Service treatment records (STRs) documenting injury or illness
- Sick call records
- Hospital admission records
- After-action reports
- Purple Heart citation

**Examples:**
- STRs showing treatment for ankle sprain during training ✓
- Record of IED blast exposure ✓
- Treatment for acute stress reaction in combat zone ✓

**Exposure to hazards:**
- Burn pit exposure (PACT Act locations)
- Agent Orange (Vietnam service)
- Radiation exposure
- Asbestos
- Loud noise (combat, flight deck, artillery)

**Evidence:**
- DD-214 showing service in qualifying locations
- Unit records
- Deployment records
- Job specialty (MOS/AFSC showing noise exposure, etc.)

**Examples:**
- DD-214 shows Iraq deployment 2005-2006 (burn pit exposure) ✓
- MOS 11B (infantryman) during OEF deployment (combat exposure) ✓
- Service in Vietnam 1968-1969 (Agent Orange presumptive) ✓

**Development of condition during service:**
- Service treatment records showing symptoms or diagnosis
- Medical board records
- Periodic health assessments showing changes

**Example:**
- STRs show first diagnosis of asthma during year 2 of service ✓

**Aggravation of pre-existing condition:**
- Evidence showing condition worsened beyond natural progression during service
- Entrance exam showing baseline
- STRs showing worsening

**Example:**
- Entrance physical notes mild knee pain (baseline)
- STRs show increasing treatment and severity during service
- Proves aggravation ✓

---

**Element 3: Nexus (Medical Link)**

**What you need:**
- Medical evidence connecting your current condition (Element 1) to your in-service event (Element 2)

**This is often the hardest element to prove**

**Types of nexus evidence:**

**1. Nexus statement in medical records**
- Doctor writes in treatment notes: "Patient's current PTSD is related to military combat trauma"
- Specialist notes: "Hearing loss consistent with noise exposure during military service"

**2. Nexus letter (Independent Medical Opinion - IMO)**
- Letter from qualified medical provider stating connection between condition and service
- Must use specific language: **"At least as likely as not"** (50% or greater probability)
- Must provide medical rationale

**Example nexus letter statement:**
> "It is at least as likely as not that Mr. Smith's current lumbar degenerative disc disease is related to his military service. The patient's service treatment records document multiple instances of heavy lifting and back strain during his service from 2005-2009. Current imaging shows degenerative changes consistent with chronic repetitive strain. Medical literature supports that repetitive heavy lifting accelerates disc degeneration. Therefore, it is my medical opinion that his current condition is causally related to his military service."

**3. Lay evidence (buddy statements, personal statements)**
- Not medical nexus, but supports continuity of symptoms
- Fellow service members attest to witnessing injury or symptoms
- Personal statement describing how condition started in service and continued

**4. Medical literature and research**
- Studies linking conditions to military exposures
- VA often considers published research in nexus determinations

**5. Presumptive service connection (automatic nexus)**
- For certain conditions and exposures, VA presumes service connection
- No nexus evidence needed—just proof of service in qualifying location + current diagnosis

**Examples:**
- Agent Orange presumptives (Type 2 diabetes for Vietnam vets)
- PACT Act burn pit presumptives (respiratory conditions, cancers)
- Gulf War presumptives

---

**How the VA evaluates nexus:**

**Sufficient nexus language:**
- "At least as likely as not" (50%+) ✓
- "More likely than not" (>50%) ✓
- "As likely as not" (50%) ✓
- "Caused by" ✓
- "Related to" ✓

**Insufficient nexus language:**
- "Possible" (less than 50%) ✗
- "Cannot rule out" (not affirmative) ✗
- "May be related" (speculative) ✗

**Who can provide nexus opinion:**
- Medical Doctor (MD)
- Doctor of Osteopathy (DO)
- Physician Assistant (PA)
- Nurse Practitioner (NP)
- Psychologist (PhD or PsyD for mental health conditions)
- Other licensed healthcare providers with relevant expertise

---

**Common scenarios and evidence needed:**

**Scenario 1: Back injury from training**
- Element 1: Current diagnosis of lumbar degenerative disc disease (MRI report, doctor's diagnosis)
- Element 2: Service treatment records showing back injury during ruck march in 2008
- Element 3: Nexus letter from doctor stating "at least as likely as not" current condition related to 2008 injury

**Scenario 2: PTSD from combat**
- Element 1: PTSD diagnosis from VA or private therapist
- Element 2: DD-214 showing combat deployment, unit records, combat action badge/ribbon
- Element 3: PTSD diagnosis itself often establishes nexus if combat exposure proven (VA gives benefit of doubt for combat veterans)

**Scenario 3: Hearing loss from noise exposure**
- Element 1: Audiogram showing sensorineural hearing loss
- Element 2: MOS showing noise exposure (artillery, aviation, infantry), deployment records
- Element 3: Audiologist states hearing loss pattern consistent with noise-induced hearing loss

**Scenario 4: Respiratory condition from burn pits (PACT Act)**
- Element 1: Diagnosis of asthma (pulmonary function test, doctor diagnosis)
- Element 2: DD-214 showing service in Iraq/Afghanistan 2005 (burn pit location)
- Element 3: NONE NEEDED—presumptive under PACT Act

---

**What if you're missing one element?**

**Missing current diagnosis:**
- See a doctor and get diagnosed before filing
- Or file claim and VA will provide C&P exam for diagnosis

**Missing in-service evidence:**
- Request service treatment records (STRs) from National Archives
- Provide buddy statements from fellow service members
- Provide personal statement describing in-service event
- Research unit history or deployment records

**Missing nexus:**
- Obtain a nexus letter from a private doctor (costs $500-$2,000 typically)
- Submit medical literature supporting connection
- Provide lay evidence showing continuity of symptoms from service to present
- Some VSOs can help connect you with doctors for nexus letters

---

**How to organize evidence for your claim:**

**Create a folder for each condition with:**
1. **Current medical records** (diagnosis, treatment notes, test results)
2. **Service records** (STRs, DD-214, deployment orders, buddy statements)
3. **Nexus evidence** (nexus letter, medical opinions, research)
4. **Lay evidence** (personal statement, buddy statements, spouse statement)

**Submit everything together** (if filing Fully Developed Claim) or be prepared to submit when VA requests it.

---

**Common mistakes:**

**Mistake 1: Filing without medical evidence of diagnosis**
- Claim may be denied for lack of current diagnosis
- Get diagnosed first

**Mistake 2: Assuming VA will connect the dots**
- VA won't infer nexus—you must prove it
- Get a nexus letter if not obvious

**Mistake 3: Using weak nexus language**
- "Possible" or "maybe" won't meet the standard
- Ensure medical opinion uses "at least as likely as not"

**Mistake 4: Not gathering buddy statements**
- Lay evidence is powerful for proving in-service events
- Fellow service members can corroborate your account

**Mistake 5: Giving up if one element is weak**
- Work with VSO to gather missing evidence
- Can file Supplemental Claim with new evidence if initially denied

---

**Bottom line:**

To prove service connection, you need all three elements:
1. **Current diagnosis** (see a doctor, get medical records)
2. **In-service event** (service treatment records, DD-214, buddy statements, unit records)
3. **Nexus** (nexus letter, medical opinion, or presumptive service connection)

Gather as much evidence as possible for each element before filing. Work with a VSO to ensure your evidence is complete and compelling. Missing even one element can result in denial, so be thorough.
