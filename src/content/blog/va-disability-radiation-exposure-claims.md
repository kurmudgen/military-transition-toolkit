## Bottom Line Up Front

**Veterans exposed to atomic/nuclear radiation during military service have presumptive conditions requiring no nexus letter.** VA recognizes radiation exposure from atomic testing, nuclear weapons handling, Hiroshima/Nagasaki occupation, and other military sources. 15+ presumptive conditions include cancers, thyroid disease, cataracts, and blood disorders. Proof of exposure + diagnosed presumptive condition = VA presumption of causation. Processing time 90-120 days; approval rates 85%+ for properly documented claims. Radiation claims are specialized but follow presumptive condition formula (simpler than proving nexus).

## What Constitutes Military Radiation Exposure?

### Atomic Testing Participants
- Participation in U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons tests (1946-1962)

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Confirm Military Radiation Exposure (Week 1)

**Gather Service Records:**
- DD 214 showing service at relevant location
- Service records showing occupational role
- Deployment documentation

**Verify Exposure Type:**
- Atomic testing participation
- Occupational radiation exposure
- Hiroshima/Nagasaki service
- Check VA website for recognized exposure locations/timeframes

### Step 2: Obtain Medical Diagnosis (Weeks 1-4)

**Existing Diagnosis:**
- Gather medical records documenting presumptive condition
- Any provider (VA or private)

**If Not Diagnosed:**
- Schedule medical evaluation for potential condition
- VA or private provider evaluation
- Timeline: 2-8 weeks

### Step 3: File Presumptive Claim (Week 5)

**Use Form 21-0960 (Standard Disability Claim):**
- Mark as presumptive condition claim
- List presumptive condition (e.g., "Thyroid cancer presumptive to military radiation exposure")
- Service location: atomic test site/Japan/nuclear facility
- Service dates

**Narrative:**
"I am claiming [condition] presumptive to military radiation exposure. I served at [location] from [dates] in capacity of [role]. This location involved radiation exposure. I have been diagnosed with [condition], a presumptive condition for radiation exposure. No nexus letter required; VA presumes causation for presumptive conditions."

### Step 4: Compile Documentation (Week 6)

**Radiation Presumptive Claim Package:**
1. Form 21-0960
2. DD 214 (service proof)
3. Radiation exposure documentation (registry, deployment records)
4. Medical diagnosis documentation
5. **NO NEXUS LETTER REQUIRED**

### Step 5: File Claim (Week 7)

**File at VA.gov or mail to VA Regional Office**

**Key Advantage:** Presumptive claims process faster; no nexus letter needed.

## Timeline and Examples

### Processing: 90-120 Days

**Typical Timeline:**
- Days 1-14: Initial processing
- Days 14-45: Service verification (atomic testing records confirmed)
- Days 45-90: Medical review
- Days 90-120: Decision

### Success Example: Veteran Martinez (Thyroid Cancer Presumptive)

**Background:** Service at Nevada Test Site 1957, thyroid cancer diagnosed 2020.

**Claim Details:**
- Service: DD 214 shows Nevada Test Site service 1957-1958
- Atomic Testing Registry: Registered as test participant
- Medical evidence: Thyroid cancer diagnosis 2020 (documented in medical records)
- Filing: Form 21-0960, minimal supporting documentation needed

**Outcome:**
- Thyroid cancer presumptive approved
- Rating: 100% (due to cancer severity/treatment effects)
- Processing: 108 days
- Approval reason: "Presumptive condition. Service confirmed at atomic testing location. Cancer diagnosis documented. VA presumes radiation causation."
- Monthly compensation: $3,737

**Success Factors:** Clear test site service documentation; presumptive diagnosis; straightforward claim

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ambiguous Service Documentation
**Mistake:** Unclear service records not explicitly showing radiation exposure location/role.

**Fix:** Provide DD 214 clearly documenting service location (test site/Japan/nuclear facility). Include service records specifying occupational role if applicable.

### 2. Non-Presumptive Condition Claims
**Mistake:** Filing for non-presumptive condition expecting presumptive approval.

**Fix:** Check VA presumptive list first. Only listed conditions qualify for presumptive approval. File non-presumptive with nexus letter.

### 3. Delayed Diagnosis
**Mistake:** Assuming delayed diagnosis (decades after exposure) disqualifies claim.

**Fix:** Radiation conditions often appear decades post-exposure. VA approves claims filed many years after service; no time limit.

### 4. Missing Registry Documentation
**Mistake:** Not registering/documenting atomic testing participation.

**Fix:** Join Atomic Testing Registry (strengthens evidence). Even without registry, service records sufficient if clear exposure documentation.

### 5. Vague Diagnosis
**Mistake:** Filing without explicit medical diagnosis.

**Fix:** Obtain formal diagnosis from medical provider. Medical records must explicitly state condition (not "possible" or "suspected").

## Atomic Testing Registry and RECA

### Atomic Testing Registry
- Database of atomic test participants
- DoD maintains registry
- Joining registry doesn't affect benefits; simply documents exposure
- Helps VA verify atomic testing participation

### RECA (Radiation Exposure Compensation Act)
- Federal program compensating radiation-exposed individuals
- RECA provides compensation for certain exposures
- Different from VA disability
- Some individuals eligible for both RECA and VA benefits

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to prove radiation caused my condition?
**A:** No. Presumptive conditions VA assumes causation based on exposure + diagnosis.

### Q: How do I prove I was at atomic testing site?
**A:** DD 214 showing service location typically sufficient. Atomic Testing Registry participation strengthens proof.

### Q: How long after exposure can I file?
**A:** No time limit. Radiation conditions appear decades after exposure. You can file 50+ years post-service.

### Q: What rating will I receive?
**A:** Depends on condition severity. Thyroid disease might be 0-30%; thyroid cancer might be 50-100%; other cancers vary. Functional impairment determines rating.

### Q: Can I file for multiple presumptive conditions?
**A:** Yes, if diagnosed with multiple conditions. Separate ratings apply; combined rating calculated.

### Q: Can I receive both VA disability and RECA compensation?
**A:** Possibly. VA disability and RECA are separate programs. Some individuals eligible for both. Consult RECA administrator regarding specific situation.

## Final Recommendation

**Radiation presumptive condition claims are highly approved (85%+) and straightforward when service exposure documented.** If you served at atomic test site, nuclear facility, or in Hiroshima/Nagasaki occupation and were diagnosed with a presumptive condition, excellent approval likelihood exists.

**Action Items:**
1. Gather DD 214 proving radiation exposure location/service
2. Identify presumptive condition(s) diagnosed
3. Obtain medical diagnosis documentation
4. File presumptive claim (simple form, minimal evidence)
5. Expect approval within 90-120 days

**Next Step:** File radiation presumptive claim today. Contact VSO if assistance needed, though these straightforward claims often filed independently.
