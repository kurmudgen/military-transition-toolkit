# VA Combined Rating Calculator: How the VA Math Really Works

## Bottom Line Up Front

VA combined ratings don't use regular math. **50% + 50% = 75%, not 100%.** The VA uses a system where each rating applies to your remaining "whole person" percentage, not the full 100%. Understanding this system helps you predict your rating and strategize your claims. This guide explains exactly how VA math works, including the bilateral factor and rounding rules.

## Why VA Math Is Different

### The Basic Concept

The VA assumes you start as a "whole person" at 100%. Each disability takes away a percentage of **what remains**, not 100%.

**Logic:** If you're 50% disabled, you're 50% "efficient." A second 50% disability affects your remaining 50% efficiency, not the full person.

### Simple Example

**Veteran with two 50% disabilities:**

1. Start at 100% (whole person)
2. First 50% disability: 100% × 50% = 50% taken
   - Remaining efficiency: 100% - 50% = **50%**
3. Second 50% disability: 50% × 50% = 25% taken from remaining
   - Remaining efficiency: 50% - 25% = **25%**
4. Total disability: 100% - 25% = **75%**

**50% + 50% = 75%** (not 100%)

## The VA Combined Rating Formula

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **List all disabilities** from highest to lowest percentage
2. **Start with the highest** disability
3. **Multiply the next disability** by the remaining efficiency
4. **Subtract from remaining efficiency**
5. **Repeat** for each additional disability
6. **Round** to nearest 10%

### Detailed Calculation Example

**Veteran with: 70%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%**

| Step | Disability | Calculation | Remaining Efficiency |
|------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Start | - | - | 100% |
| 1 | 70% | 100% × 70% = 70% | 100% - 70% = 30% |
| 2 | 50% | 30% × 50% = 15% | 30% - 15% = 15% |
| 3 | 40% | 15% × 40% = 6% | 15% - 6% = 9% |
| 4 | 30% | 9% × 30% = 2.7% | 9% - 2.7% = 6.3% |
| 5 | 20% | 6.3% × 20% = 1.26% | 6.3% - 1.26% = 5.04% |

**Final efficiency:** 5.04%
**Combined disability:** 100% - 5.04% = **94.96%**
**Rounded:** **90%**

(VA rounds down to nearest 10%, unless 0.5 or higher in ones place rounds up)

## Rounding Rules

### Final Rounding

The final combined percentage is rounded to the nearest 10%:
- 0-4 rounds down (94% → 90%)
- 5-9 rounds up (95% → 100%)

### Examples

| Raw Combined | Rounded |
|--------------|---------|
| 91% | 90% |
| 94% | 90% |
| 95% | 100% |
| 98% | 100% |
| 73% | 70% |
| 76% | 80% |

**Key insight:** Getting from 94% to 95% raw makes a huge difference—90% vs. 100% compensation.

## The Bilateral Factor

### What It Is

The bilateral factor adds **10% to the combined rating of bilateral (both sides) disabilities** before combining with other disabilities.

### When It Applies

- Both arms affected
- Both legs affected
- Both arms and both legs affected
- Applies to paired limbs: arms, legs, hands, feet, ears, eyes

### How to Calculate

1. **Combine all bilateral disabilities** using VA math
2. **Add 10%** to that combined value
3. **Combine this result** with non-bilateral disabilities

### Bilateral Factor Example

**Veteran with:**
- Left knee: 30%
- Right knee: 20%
- PTSD: 50%

**Step 1: Combine bilateral (knees)**

| Disability | Remaining |
|------------|-----------|
| Start | 100% |
| Left knee 30% | 100% - 30% = 70% |
| Right knee 20% | 70% - 14% (70%×20%) = 56% |

Combined bilateral: 100% - 56% = **44%**

**Step 2: Apply bilateral factor**

44% + (44% × 10%) = 44% + 4.4% = **48.4%**

**Step 3: Combine with PTSD**

| Disability | Remaining |
|------------|-----------|
| Start | 100% |
| PTSD 50% | 100% - 50% = 50% |
| Bilateral (48.4%) | 50% - 24.2% = 25.8% |

Combined: 100% - 25.8% = **74.2%**
**Rounded: 70%**

**Without bilateral factor:** Would have been lower. The 10% boost matters.

## VA Combined Rating Table

The VA uses an official Combined Ratings Table for quick lookups. Here are some common combinations:

### Two Disabilities

| First | Second | Combined |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 30% | 30% | 51% |
| 40% | 30% | 58% |
| 50% | 30% | 65% |
| 50% | 50% | 75% |
| 60% | 40% | 76% |
| 70% | 30% | 79% |
| 70% | 50% | 85% |
| 80% | 50% | 90% |

### Three Disabilities

| 1st | 2nd | 3rd | Combined |
|-----|-----|-----|----------|
| 50% | 30% | 20% | 72% |
| 50% | 40% | 30% | 79% |
| 60% | 40% | 30% | 83% |
| 70% | 40% | 30% | 87% |
| 70% | 50% | 30% | 90% |

## Strategic Implications

### Diminishing Returns

Each additional disability adds less to your combined rating:
- First 50% adds 50%
- Second 50% adds only 25% more
- Third 50% adds only 12.5% more

**Implication:** Higher individual ratings matter more than many small ratings.

### Reaching 100%

To reach 100% (or 95% for rounding), you typically need:
- One very high rating (90%+), OR
- Multiple significant ratings (70%+50%+30%+), OR
- TDIU (different path)

### Maximizing Your Rating

**Strategies:**
1. **Pursue higher ratings** on existing conditions (increases count)
2. **File secondary claims** (add conditions to combine)
3. **Claim bilateral conditions** (get the 10% bilateral factor)
4. **Understand rounding** (94% vs 95% is huge)

## Common Scenarios

### Breaking the 90% Barrier

At 90% (combined), you need significant additional disability to reach 95%:
- 90% + 50% = 95% (rounds to 100%)
- 90% + 40% = 94% (rounds to 90%)
- 90% + 30% = 93% (rounds to 90%)

### Multiple Small Ratings

Small ratings add up slowly:
- 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% = 41% (rounds to 40%)
- Five 20% ratings = 67% (rounds to 70%)

### Getting to 70%

70% unlocks more dependent compensation:
- 60% + 20% = 68% (rounds to 70%)
- 50% + 30% + 10% = 65% (rounds to 70%)
- 50% + 40% = 70%

## Using a Calculator

### Online Calculators

Several websites offer VA combined rating calculators:
- va.gov (official)
- Various veteran websites

### Calculator Tips

1. Enter disabilities from highest to lowest
2. Group bilateral disabilities
3. Check if bilateral factor applies
4. Remember: Calculator shows pre-rounded number

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Adding Percentages Directly

**Wrong:** 30% + 30% + 30% = 90%
**Right:** 30% + 30% + 30% = 66% (rounds to 70%)

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Bilateral Factor

If you have paired disabilities (both knees, both shoulders), the 10% bilateral factor applies. Missing this costs you rating points.

### Mistake 3: Not Understanding Rounding

94.9% rounds to 90%, not 100%. Know your raw combined to understand what additional rating you need.

### Mistake 4: Giving Up on Reaching 100%

TDIU exists for veterans who can't work but don't have 100% schedular. Don't assume you need perfect VA math to get 100% pay.

## Key Takeaways

1. **VA math reduces each disability's impact** based on remaining efficiency
2. **Order matters less than magnitude** - higher ratings contribute more
3. **Bilateral factor adds 10%** to paired limb disabilities
4. **Final rating rounds** to nearest 10% (5-9 rounds up)
5. **Use calculators** but understand the math
6. **95% or higher = 100%** after rounding
7. **Small ratings have diminishing returns**

Understanding VA math helps you strategize your claims and predict your combined rating.
