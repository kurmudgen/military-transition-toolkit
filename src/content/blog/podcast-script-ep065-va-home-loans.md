[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

The VA home loan is one of the most valuable military benefits most veterans never fully understand. Zero down payment. No private mortgage insurance. No prepayment penalties. Interest rates typically 0.5-1% lower than conventional loans. The average VA loan saves veterans $42,000+ over the life of the mortgage compared to conventional financing. In 2025, you can buy a home up to $806,500 with zero money down in most areas, up to $1.2 million in high-cost counties. And you can use this benefit multiple times - buy, sell, buy again, as many times as you need throughout your lifetime. The funding fee ranges from 1.25-3.3% of the loan amount, but about one-third of veterans are exempt - anyone with a 10%+ disability rating pays zero funding fee. You can refinance your existing VA loan with an IRRRL streamline refinance for as little as 0.5% funding fee, no appraisal, no income verification. For a first-time buyer saving a median 15% of income, it takes 4.4 years to save enough for a conventional down payment. With a VA loan, you buy today. I'm Jacob, Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're covering exactly how VA home loans work, who qualifies, the costs, how to use it multiple times, and why this benefit alone justifies military service for many veterans. This is Veteran Transition Blueprint.

**What is the VA Home Loan Benefit?**

The VA home loan program, established in 1944, helps service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses become homeowners. VA doesn't lend money directly - it guarantees a portion of the loan, which allows private lenders to offer better terms than conventional mortgages.

**The VA guarantee:** VA guarantees up to 25% of the loan amount to the lender. If the borrower defaults, VA pays the lender part of the loss. This guarantee reduces the lender's risk, which is why lenders offer zero down payment and no PMI.

**Current usage:** In 2024, over 1.4 million VA-backed home loans were active. Veterans use this benefit for purchases, refinances, and new construction.

**Why this benefit matters:** Homeownership builds wealth. The median homeowner has a net worth 40 times higher than the median renter. VA loans remove the largest barrier to homeownership - the down payment requirement.

**Basic Eligibility - Who Qualifies?**

**Active duty service members:** 90 consecutive days of active duty during wartime, OR 181 days of active duty during peacetime.

**Veterans:** Depending on when you served:
- 90 days of active service during wartime periods
- 181 days during peacetime
- 6 years in National Guard or Reserves
- Discharged for service-connected disability (may qualify with less time)

**National Guard and Reserves:** 6 years of service in the Selected Reserve or National Guard, OR 90 days of active duty (including 30 consecutive days if discharged for service-connected disability).

**Surviving spouses:** Un-remarried spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty or from a service-connected disability, OR spouse of a missing-in-action or POW service member.

**How to verify eligibility:** Apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) through VA or have your lender obtain it. Most lenders can pull your COE electronically in minutes using your SSN and military service information.

**The Major Benefits of VA Loans**

Let's break down what makes VA loans so valuable compared to conventional financing.

**Benefit #1 - Zero Down Payment:**

VA loans allow 0% down payment on homes up to the conforming loan limit. In 2025, that's $806,500 in most areas, up to $1,209,750 in high-cost counties like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York.

**What this means:** Buy a $400,000 home with $0 upfront. A conventional buyer would need $80,000 (20% down) to avoid PMI, or $20,000 (5% down) with PMI.

**The time savings:** For a first-time buyer earning the median $78,700 annually and saving 15% of income ($11,805/year), it takes 4.4 years to save the $51,600 down payment for a $430,000 home. With a VA loan, you buy today instead of in 4.4 years.

**Reality check - should you put zero down?** You CAN put zero down, but that doesn't always mean you should. Putting some money down reduces your monthly payment, builds equity faster, and can help in competitive markets where sellers prefer buyers with skin in the game. But having the option to put zero down means you can buy when the opportunity is right, not when you've saved 20%.

**Benefit #2 - No Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):**

Conventional loans require PMI if you put less than 20% down. PMI costs 0.5-1.5% of the loan amount annually, typically $100-$200 per month on a $300,000 loan.

**VA loans never require PMI, regardless of down payment.** Put zero down, 5% down, 10% down - no PMI ever.

**The savings:** $150/month × 12 months × 10 years (until you reach 20% equity on conventional loan) = $18,000. Over a 30-year mortgage, avoiding PMI can save $36,000+.

**Benefit #3 - Lower Interest Rates:**

VA loans typically offer interest rates 0.5-1% lower than conventional loans. The VA guarantee reduces lender risk, so they pass savings to borrowers.

**Example:**
- $400,000 loan at 7% (conventional) = $2,661/month principal and interest
- $400,000 loan at 6.5% (VA) = $2,528/month
- Monthly savings: $133
- 30-year savings: $47,880

**Combined with no PMI:** $133 + $150 = $283/month savings, or $101,880 over 30 years.

**Benefit #4 - No Prepayment Penalties:**

Pay off your VA loan early or make extra payments anytime without penalties. Many conventional loans charge fees for early payoff.

**Benefit #5 - Seller Can Pay All Closing Costs:**

VA allows the seller to pay up to 4% of the home price toward your closing costs. If negotiated, you could buy a home with literally $0 out of pocket except the VA funding fee (which can be financed into the loan).

**Benefit #6 - Foreclosure Protections:**

If you experience financial hardship, VA provides foreclosure avoidance assistance and works with you more aggressively than conventional loans. VA wants you to keep your home.

**Benefit #7 - Assumability:**

VA loans are assumable, meaning a future buyer can take over your existing VA loan at your interest rate. In a rising rate environment, this makes your home more attractive to buyers.

**The VA Funding Fee - The One Cost**

VA loans don't require down payments or PMI, but they do require a VA funding fee. This one-time fee helps fund the VA loan program for future generations.

**2024-2025 Funding Fee Rates:**

**Purchase loans:**
- First-time use, 0% down: 2.15% of loan amount
- First-time use, 5-9.9% down: 1.5%
- First-time use, 10%+ down: 1.25%
- Subsequent use, 0% down: 3.3%
- Subsequent use, 5-9.9% down: 1.5%
- Subsequent use, 10%+ down: 1.25%

**Refinance loans:**
- IRRRL (streamline refinance): 0.5%
- Cash-out refinance: 2.15% (first use), 3.3% (subsequent use)

**Example:** $300,000 home, first-time VA loan, zero down payment:
Funding fee: $300,000 × 2.15% = $6,450

**You can finance the funding fee into your loan.** Most veterans do. You're not paying $6,450 upfront - it's added to your loan balance ($300,000 becomes $306,450).

**Who's exempt from the funding fee - About 33% of VA loan users:**

- Veterans receiving VA disability compensation (10% or higher rating)
- Veterans rated by VA as eligible to receive compensation (even if not currently receiving it)
- Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected conditions
- Purple Heart recipients

**If you have a 10%+ disability rating, you pay ZERO funding fee.** On a $300,000 purchase, you save $6,450. On a $500,000 purchase, you save $10,750.

**This is why filing your disability claim matters.** Even a 10% rating saves you thousands on a VA home loan.

**VA Loan Limits and Entitlement**

Understanding entitlement is crucial for using your VA loan benefit optimally.

**What is entitlement?** The amount VA will guarantee on your loan. Your entitlement determines how much you can borrow with zero down payment.

**Full entitlement vs. partial entitlement:**

**Full entitlement:** Most veterans have full entitlement, meaning you can buy a home with zero down up to the conforming loan limit ($806,500 in 2025 for most areas) without a loan limit.

**You have full entitlement if:**
- This is your first VA loan, OR
- You've paid off a previous VA loan and sold the property, OR
- You've had a previous VA loan but you've had your entitlement restored

**Partial entitlement:** If you currently have a VA loan on a property you still own, part of your entitlement is "used up" on that property. You have partial entitlement remaining.

**Can you have two VA loans at once?** Yes, if you have enough remaining entitlement. Example: You bought a $250,000 home with a VA loan in Texas. You get PCS'd to California. You want to buy a second home and keep the Texas property as a rental. If you have sufficient remaining entitlement, you can get a second VA loan for the California home.

**How to restore entitlement:** Sell the property and pay off the VA loan, or have another eligible veteran assume your VA loan. Once restored, you have full entitlement again for your next purchase.

**Above the loan limit:** You can buy a home above the conforming limit, but you'll need a down payment on the amount exceeding the limit. Example: $1 million home in an area with $806,500 limit. VA guarantees up to $806,500 worth. You'd need to put down approximately 25% of the $193,500 excess, or about $48,000.

**How Many Times Can You Use Your VA Loan?**

There is NO LIMIT to how many times you can use your VA loan benefit throughout your lifetime.

**The standard path:**
1. Buy first home with VA loan
2. Live in it, then sell it and pay off the loan
3. Your entitlement is restored
4. Buy second home with VA loan
5. Repeat as many times as needed

**Real-world example:** Veteran uses VA loan at age 25 to buy first home. Sells at 30, uses VA loan again. Sells at 38, uses VA loan again. Sells at 45, uses VA loan again. Uses VA loan 4 times over 20 years, saving $42,000+ on each purchase = $168,000+ in lifetime savings.

**The occupancy requirement:** You must intend to occupy the home as your primary residence. You can't use a VA loan to buy an investment property upfront, but you can convert it to a rental after you've lived there. Many veterans build rental portfolios this way - buy with VA loan, live there 1-2 years, rent it out, get another VA loan for next primary residence, repeat.

**Types of Properties You Can Buy with a VA Loan**

**Eligible properties:**
- Single-family homes
- Condos (if VA-approved)
- Townhouses
- Multi-unit properties (2-4 units, as long as you occupy one unit)
- Manufactured/mobile homes (if permanently affixed to land you own)
- New construction (builder must be VA-approved)

**VA allows you to buy a duplex, triplex, or fourplex** with zero down as long as you occupy one unit. This is huge for wealth-building - you live in one unit, rent out the others. The rental income can help cover your mortgage.

**Not eligible:**
- Investment properties (must be primary residence at purchase)
- Vacation homes
- Properties in poor condition requiring major repairs (VA has minimum property requirements)

**VA IRRRL - Streamline Refinance**

If you already have a VA loan and interest rates drop, the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL) - pronounced "earl" - lets you refinance easily.

**How IRRRL works:**
- Reduce your interest rate
- Convert adjustable rate to fixed rate
- Lower your monthly payment

**IRRRL benefits:**
- 0.5% funding fee (much lower than purchase)
- No appraisal in most cases
- No income verification
- No credit check in many cases
- Fast process - can close in weeks

**Example:** You have a $300,000 VA loan at 7%. Rates drop to 6%. IRRRL lets you refinance to the new rate with minimal paperwork and a funding fee of only $1,500 (0.5% of $300,000).

**Monthly savings:** $300,000 at 7% = $1,996/month. At 6% = $1,799/month. You save $197/month, or $71,000 over the remaining loan life.

**IRRRL rules:**
- Must already have a VA loan
- Must result in lower interest rate OR lower monthly payment
- Cannot get cash out (except up to $6,000 for energy-efficient improvements)
- Must certify you previously occupied the home

**Cash-Out Refinance**

Separate from IRRRL, VA offers cash-out refinancing if you want to tap into your home equity.

**How it works:** Refinance your current loan (VA or conventional) for more than you owe and take the difference in cash.

**Example:** Your home is worth $400,000. You owe $250,000. You can refinance for up to $400,000 (or up to 100% of appraised value), pay off the $250,000 loan, and receive up to $150,000 in cash.

**Funding fee:** 2.15% first use, 3.3% subsequent use (unless exempt).

**Common uses for cash-out:**
- Home improvements/renovations
- Debt consolidation
- Education expenses
- Emergency expenses
- Investment opportunities

**Note:** Cash-out refinancing increases your loan amount and monthly payment. Use wisely.

**Comparing VA Loan to Conventional**

Let's put real numbers on the VA loan advantage.

**$350,000 home purchase comparison:**

**Conventional loan (5% down):**
- Down payment: $17,500
- Loan amount: $332,500
- PMI: $165/month
- Interest rate: 7%
- Monthly payment: $2,210 + $165 PMI = $2,375
- Total paid over 30 years: $855,000

**VA loan (0% down):**
- Down payment: $0
- Loan amount: $350,000 (plus funding fee of $7,525 financed in = $357,525)
- PMI: $0
- Interest rate: 6.5% (0.5% lower)
- Monthly payment: $2,260
- Total paid over 30 years: $813,600

**Savings:** $855,000 - $813,600 = $41,400 over life of loan. Plus you bought immediately instead of waiting years to save down payment.

**The wealth-building impact:** Buying 4.4 years sooner means 4.4 years of equity building instead of paying rent. If home appreciates 3% annually, that $350,000 home is worth $399,000 in 4.4 years. You captured $49,000 in appreciation by buying now vs. waiting. Total financial advantage of VA loan in this scenario: $90,000+.

**Common VA Loan Mistakes**

**Mistake #1: Not getting pre-approved before house hunting.**

Get your COE and pre-approval before shopping. Sellers won't take you seriously without it.

**Mistake #2: Assuming you can't compete with cash buyers.**

In hot markets, veterans worry VA loans can't compete. Reality: Most sellers care about closing successfully, not payment method. A solid VA pre-approval is as good as conventional in most cases.

**Mistake #3: Not using the benefit because you think you need perfect credit.**

VA loans are more forgiving than conventional. Minimum credit score is often 580-620 depending on lender. Don't assume you won't qualify.

**Mistake #4: Paying PMI because you don't know about VA loans.**

Too many eligible veterans get conventional loans with PMI because they don't realize they qualify for VA loans. Check your eligibility before getting a conventional loan.

**Mistake #5: Not using the benefit multiple times.**

You bought one home with a VA loan and think you're done. Use it again when you move. And again. There's no limit.

**Mistake #6: Not filing your disability claim before buying a home.**

If you file your claim and get even a 10% rating before closing on your loan, you're exempt from the funding fee. On a $300,000 loan, that saves $6,450. File your disability claim as early as possible.

**Mistake #7: Not understanding assumability.**

Your VA loan is assumable. When you sell, offering the assumable loan to buyers (especially if your rate is lower than current rates) can make your home more attractive and command a higher price.

**The Bottom Line Value**

VA home loan benefit provides:
- $42,000+ savings over life of loan compared to conventional
- $50,000+ in captured appreciation by buying years earlier
- Ability to buy with $0 down immediately
- No PMI ever
- Lower interest rates
- Unlimited lifetime uses

**For many veterans, this single benefit is worth more financially than all other VA benefits combined.** Use it. Use it multiple times. And if you have a disability rating, you use it with even greater advantage by avoiding the funding fee.
