## TERMINAL LEAVE (Q401-Q410)

### Q401: How does terminal leave work and should I take it? {#q401}

**A:** Terminal leave allows you to use accrued leave days at the end of your service while receiving full pay and benefits, effectively extending your employment and providing income during transition, and you should almost always take it if you have leave available.

Terminal leave is one of the most valuable financial benefits when separating from military service.

**What is terminal leave?**

**Terminal leave = Using your accrued leave days at the end of service**

Instead of selling back leave or losing it, you go on leave before your official separation date and continue receiving:
- Full base pay
- Housing allowance (BAH/BAS)
- All benefits (healthcare, etc.)
- The leave days count as active duty service

**Example:**
- Planned separation date: December 31, 2024
- Accrued leave: 60 days
- Terminal leave start: November 1, 2024
- You're on leave Nov 1 - Dec 31 (receiving full pay and benefits)
- Official separation: December 31, 2024
- You've been job searching, moving, and transitioning for 2 months while still getting paid

**Financial benefits of terminal leave:**

**Scenario: E-6 with 60 days of leave**

*Option 1: Sell back leave*
- Sell 60 days at base pay only (no BAH/BAS)
- $4,000/month base pay ÷ 30 days = $133/day
- 60 days × $133 = $8,000 (before taxes)
- After taxes (~20%): ~$6,400

*Option 2: Take terminal leave*
- 60 days of full pay + BAH + BAS
- Base pay: $8,000 (60 days)
- BAH: $2,400 (60 days)
- BAS: $600 (60 days)
- **Total: $11,000** (BAH is tax-free)
- **Plus you keep full benefits for 60 days**

**Terminal leave is worth $4,600 MORE than selling back**

**Plus these hidden benefits:**

1. **Health insurance coverage**
   - TRICARE continues during terminal leave
   - Saves you from buying civilian health insurance for 1-2 months
   - Value: $500-$1,500

2. **Time to job search**
   - Start civilian job during terminal leave
   - Double income if you get job before separation
   - Can attend interviews without taking time off

3. **Time to move**
   - Use terminal leave for PCS move
   - No rush to vacate housing
   - More time to find new home

4. **Continued access to base services**
   - Commissary, exchange, gym
   - Final appointments (dental, medical)
   - Clearing process

**How much leave can you take?**

**Maximum:** 60 days of leave can be sold back over entire military career
**But:** You can take unlimited terminal leave (within your accrued balance)

**Example:**
- You have 90 days of leave accrued
- You can take all 90 days as terminal leave
- (You couldn't sell 90 days—max sellback is 60 career total)

**Common terminal leave scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: 60 days leave, sold 30 days in past**
- Accrued: 60 days
- Previously sold: 30 days
- Can sell: 30 more days (60 career limit)
- **Recommendation:** Take all 60 as terminal leave (worth more than selling)

**Scenario 2: 90 days leave, never sold any**
- Accrued: 90 days
- Can sell: 60 days max
- **Recommendation:** Take all 90 as terminal leave OR take 30 as terminal + sell 60

**Scenario 3: 30 days leave**
- Accrued: 30 days
- **Recommendation:** Take 30 days terminal leave (provides ~1 month income buffer)

**How to request terminal leave:**

1. **Check your leave balance**
   - myPay or LES (Leave and Earnings Statement)
   - Talk to your unit S-1/admin

2. **Plan your terminal leave dates**
   - Calculate backward from separation date
   - Example: Separate Dec 31, have 60 days → Terminal leave starts Nov 1

3. **Submit leave request (DA Form 31 or equivalent)**
   - Route through your chain of command
   - Get approval before separation date finalized

4. **Coordinate with transition office**
   - Ensure terminal leave dates work with out-processing
   - Complete most clearing before terminal leave starts

**Can terminal leave be denied?**

**Technically yes, but rare:**
- Commander has authority to deny
- Usually only denied if mission-critical need
- Most units approve terminal leave requests

**If denied:**
- You can sell back leave (up to 60 days career total)
- Leave is paid as lump sum at separation
- Only base pay is compensated (no BAH/BAS)

**Out-processing during terminal leave:**

**Best practice:**
1. **Complete clearing before terminal leave**
   - Medical, dental, CIF, finance, etc.
   - Don't leave clearing tasks for terminal leave period

2. **If you must clear during terminal leave:**
   - Schedule appointments early in terminal leave
   - Once cleared, you're free to leave area

3. **Final out date:**
   - Your official separation/ETS date (end of terminal leave)
   - Return ID card on this date (or mail in)

**Can you start a civilian job during terminal leave?**

**Yes (in most cases):**
- Terminal leave = regular leave (you can do what you want)
- Many veterans start civilian jobs while on terminal leave
- **Double income:** Military pay + civilian salary

**Considerations:**
- Check for any post-service employment restrictions (rare)
- Don't violate ethics rules (e.g., working for contractor you oversaw)
- Manage workload—don't burn out

**Tax implications:**

**Terminal leave pay:**
- Taxed as regular military pay
- Base pay: Fully taxable
- BAH/BAS: Tax-free (as usual)

**Leave sell-back pay:**
- Fully taxable (base pay only, no allowances)
- Usually results in higher tax rate because it's lump sum

**Should you take terminal leave or sell it back?**

**Take terminal leave if:**
- You want time to job search and transition
- You need health insurance coverage to bridge to civilian job
- You want to maximize total compensation (leave = more than sell-back)
- You have significant leave balance (30+ days)

**Sell leave back if:**
- You already have a job starting immediately and need lump sum cash
- Commander denies terminal leave
- You have very little leave (10-15 days) and prefer cash

**For 95% of service members, terminal leave is the better choice**

**Combining terminal leave with other benefits:**

**Terminal leave + BDD (Benefits Delivery at Discharge):**
- File VA disability claim 90-180 days before separation
- Complete C&P exams during terminal leave or before
- Receive VA rating decision shortly after separation

**Terminal leave + job search:**
- Use leave time to attend interviews, networking events
- Can accept job and start before official separation

**Terminal leave + relocation:**
- Use time to move to new city
- House hunt without rushing
- Get settled before starting new job

**Bottom line:**

Terminal leave is worth thousands of dollars more than selling leave back, provides time to transition, and maintains your benefits. Unless you have a specific reason to sell leave, always take terminal leave. Plan carefully, complete clearing beforehand, and use the time strategically for job search, relocation, and transition.
