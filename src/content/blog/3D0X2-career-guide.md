## Common Mistakes

**1. Not Getting Cloud Certifications:** Cloud is future. Get AWS or Azure cert before/immediately after separation. Game-changer for salary.

**2. Ignoring Scripting:** PowerShell and Python critical for modern sysadmin. Learn automation. DevOps pays $20K-$40K more.

**3. Only Applying to Defense Contractors:** Commercial IT often pays better with better hours. Banks, healthcare, tech companies all need sysadmins.

**4. Not Building Home Lab:** Employers want to see continued learning. Build lab with Active Directory, virtualization, cloud. Shows initiative.

**5. Underselling Experience:** Don't say "managed servers." Say "Administered 200-server enterprise environment supporting 5,000 users with 99.9% uptime."

## Interview Prep
