## FAQ

**Q: How much faster do military 15Q controllers advance in FAA?**
A: Typically faster 1-2 grade levels. Military controllers often enter at GS-8 instead of GS-7. Advancement timeline is similar (GS progression) but starting point higher.

**Q: What facility should I request?**
A: High-volume facilities (New York, LA, Chicago, Atlanta) offer highest salaries, most overtime, and greatest advancement opportunity. However, they're highly competitive. Regional facilities more accessible initially.

**Q: How much overtime do controllers typically work?**
A: 10-30+ hours/month depending on facility size. High-volume facilities: 30-50 hours/month typical. Overtime at time-and-a-half adds $15,000-$50,000+ annually.

**Q: What's the pension value for FAA controllers?**
A: Approximately 56% of final average salary for life (usually calculated from highest 3 years). For controller earning $160,000 final year, pension = $89,600/year for life. Exceptional benefit.

**Q: Can I lateral move between facilities?**
A: Yes, controllers can request transfer after 2-3 years. However, each facility has different certification requirements. Most controllers transfer once they're fully certified.

**Q: What happens if I want to leave FAA before 20 years?**
A: You'd forfeit pension benefits (unless you have 5+ years, which vests a smaller amount). However, TSP (federal 401k) contributions are yours to keep. 20-year vesting incentivizes longer careers.

**Q: How stable are FAA controller jobs?**
A: Very stable. Federal civil service protections, union representation (NATCA - National Air Traffic Controllers Association), and essential service status. Job security is exceptional.

**Q: What's the career ceiling for controllers?**
A: GS-14 ($190,000-$220,000+) is typical maximum for controller track. Supervisors/managers can reach GS-15 ($220,000-$280,000+). VP or director-level: $250,000-$400,000+.

**Q: Should I focus on en route or TRACON/approach control?**
A: En route typically higher salary and less stressful. TRACON/approach more dynamic. Both reach similar salary ceilings. Choose based on preference for complexity vs. workload.

**Q: Will I get military hiring preference?**
A: Yes. Veteran hiring preference (5-10 points added to score) significantly improves FAA hiring chances. Disabled veterans get additional preference. Very valuable advantage.
