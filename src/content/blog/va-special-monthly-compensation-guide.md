# VA Special Monthly Compensation (SMC): Complete Guide to Additional Benefits

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)** is extra VA compensation beyond the standard rating schedule for veterans with severe disabilities, loss of use of organs/limbs, or need for aid and attendance. SMC can add **hundreds to thousands of dollars monthly** on top of your regular compensation. Many qualifying veterans don't receive SMC because they don't know to claim it. If you have serious disabilities, you may be entitled to more than your rating alone provides.

## What Is SMC?

SMC is additional compensation for disabilities that involve:
- Loss or loss of use of specific body parts
- Certain severe disabilities
- Being housebound
- Need for aid and attendance of another person
- Multiple serious disabilities

**SMC is paid in addition to your regular disability compensation**, not instead of it.

## SMC Levels Overview

SMC comes in different "levels" designated by letters (K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T). Each has specific criteria and payment amounts.

### Quick Reference (2024 Rates)

| SMC Level | Additional Monthly Amount | General Criteria |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------|
| SMC-K | $131.64 | Loss/loss of use of one organ/extremity |
| SMC-L | $4,687.81 | Loss/loss of use requiring A&A, or blind/amputee combinations |
| SMC-M | $5,174.96 | More severe combinations |
| SMC-N | $5,882.60 | Even more severe combinations |
| SMC-O | $6,245.59 | Most severe combinations requiring A&A |
| SMC-R.1 | $8,712.83 | Need for A&A + higher level care |
| SMC-R.2 | $9,990.91 | Need for A&A + highest level care |
| SMC-S | $4,064.25 | Housebound (100% plus 60% separate) |

**Note:** These are the total amounts for that SMC level, not additions. SMC-K is added to your regular compensation.

## SMC-K: Most Common SMC Level

### What Qualifies for SMC-K

**Loss or loss of use of:**
- One hand
- One foot
- Both buttocks
- Creative organ (erectile dysfunction, loss of reproductive organs)
- One eye (blindness)
- One breast (mastectomy, including for males)
- One kidney
- Deafness in one ear

### SMC-K Payment

**$131.64/month additional** (2024 rate)

You can receive multiple SMC-K awards for different qualifying conditions (up to 3).

### SMC-K Examples

**Example 1:** Veteran with service-connected erectile dysfunction
- Regular 50% rating: $1,075.16
- Plus SMC-K: +$131.64
- **Total: $1,206.80/month**

**Example 2:** Veteran with loss of one eye
- Rated for blindness in one eye
- SMC-K automatically granted: +$131.64

**Important:** SMC-K for erectile dysfunction is often overlooked. If you have ED secondary to any service-connected condition (medications, diabetes, PTSD, spinal injury), you should receive SMC-K.

## SMC-L: Aid and Attendance Level

### What Qualifies for SMC-L

**Need for regular aid and attendance (A&A) of another person** due to:
- Being so helpless as to need regular A&A
- Being blind or so nearly blind as to need A&A
- Being a patient in a nursing home

**OR specific anatomical losses/blindness:**
- Loss/loss of use of both hands
- Loss/loss of use of both legs at ankle
- Loss/loss of use of one hand and one leg
- Blindness in both eyes with visual acuity of 5/200 or less
- Being permanently bedridden

### What "Aid and Attendance" Means

You need A&A if you require help with:
- Dressing/undressing
- Bathing
- Toileting
- Feeding
- Protecting yourself from daily hazards
- Adjusting prosthetic devices

### SMC-L Payment

**$4,687.81/month** (2024 rate)
This replaces your regular compensation up to 100%.

## SMC-S: Housebound

### What Qualifies for SMC-S

**Option 1: Statutory Housebound**
- Single disability rated 100%
- PLUS additional disabilities totaling 60%+ (independent of the 100%)

**Option 2: Factual Housebound**
- Substantially confined to home/immediate premises due to service-connected disabilities

### SMC-S Payment

**$4,064.25/month** (2024 rate)

### SMC-S Example (Statutory)

- PTSD: 100%
- Back pain: 40%
- Knee: 20%
- Combined separate disabilities: 60%+

Veteran qualifies for SMC-S (statutory housebound) = $4,064.25/month

**Important:** Many veterans who qualify for SMC-S don't receive it because they don't know to claim it.

## Higher SMC Levels (M, N, O, R)

### SMC-M Through O

These levels are for combinations of serious losses or higher need for A&A:

- **SMC-M:** Loss of both hands, both feet, one hand and one foot, blindness + A&A needed
- **SMC-N:** Loss/loss of use of both arms at shoulder, both legs at hip, or combinations
- **SMC-O:** Need for regular A&A for all daily activities

### SMC-R.1 and R.2

For veterans who need:
- **R.1:** A&A + higher level of care for specific needs
- **R.2:** A&A + highest level of care (essentially 24-hour care needs)

These are the highest SMC levels and are for the most severely disabled veterans.

## "Half-Step" Increases

SMC has "half-step" provisions where veterans get increased rates based on combinations of losses that don't quite meet the next full level.

**Example:** A veteran at SMC-L who also qualifies for SMC-K may get SMC-L plus 1/2 the rate between L and M.

This is complex—the VA should calculate this, but verify your decision.

## How to Apply for SMC

### Automatic Grants

Some SMC is automatically granted when you receive certain ratings:
- SMC-K for loss of creative organ (ED)
- SMC-S if you have 100% + 60% separate

**However,** VA often misses these. Review your decision letter.

### Filing a Claim

If you believe you qualify for SMC:

1. **File VA Form 21-526EZ** (claim for disability compensation)
2. **Specify SMC** in Section I (What are you claiming?)
3. **Include evidence:**
   - Medical records showing condition
   - Statements about need for A&A (if applicable)
   - Functional assessments

### Evidence for Aid and Attendance

To establish A&A need:
- Medical statement from doctor describing need for assistance
- VA Form 21-2680 (Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance)
- Description of daily activities requiring help
- Statement from caregiver

## Common SMC Issues

### SMC-K for ED Not Granted

**Problem:** Veteran has erectile dysfunction secondary to service-connected condition but wasn't awarded SMC-K.

**Solution:** File for SMC-K specifically. Provide evidence of ED (diagnosis, treatment, including medication) and connection to service-connected condition.

### SMC-S Not Granted (Statutory Housebound)

**Problem:** Veteran has 100% for one condition + 60% for separate conditions but wasn't awarded SMC-S.

**Solution:** Review your rating. If you meet the criteria, file for SMC-S correction. The 60% must be from disabilities independent of the 100% condition.

### A&A Denied

**Problem:** Veteran needs daily assistance but A&A was denied.

**Solution:** Get comprehensive statement from treating physician specifically addressing A&A criteria. Document all assistance needed with specific examples.

## SMC Combinations

### Can You Receive Multiple SMC Levels?

It depends:
- **Multiple SMC-K:** Yes, up to 3 (for different qualifying conditions)
- **SMC-K + Higher SMC:** Yes, SMC-K can be added to SMC-L, M, N, etc.
- **Multiple higher SMC levels:** Generally no—you receive the highest level you qualify for

### SMC Calculation Example

**Veteran with:**
- 100% for PTSD
- 50% for sleep apnea
- 30% for back pain
- 10% for tinnitus
- Erectile dysfunction (secondary to medications)

**SMC calculation:**
- Regular 100% compensation: $3,737.85
- SMC-K for loss of creative organ: +$131.64
- Qualifies for SMC-S (100% + separate 60%+): Total would be SMC-S rate

**Total: $4,064.25 + $131.64 = $4,195.89/month**

## Key Takeaways

1. **SMC-K is common** and often missed—especially for ED
2. **SMC-S** (housebound) applies if you have 100% + 60% separate
3. **Aid and attendance** requires documenting need for daily assistance
4. **SMC adds to compensation**—verify your decision includes appropriate SMC
5. **File specifically for SMC** if not automatically granted
6. **Review your rating letter** for SMC entitlements
7. **Multiple SMC-K awards** are possible (up to 3)

SMC can significantly increase your monthly compensation. If you have serious disabilities, review your entitlements carefully.
