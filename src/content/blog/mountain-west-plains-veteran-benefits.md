# Mountain West & Plains Veteran Benefits: 12 States for Outdoor Lovers

If you're the type of veteran who spent your entire military career dreaming about elk hunting, fly fishing, and living somewhere with actual elbow room—this is your regional guide.

The Mountain West and Plains states offer something you can't get on the coasts: **space**. Wide-open landscapes, outdoor recreation opportunities that'll keep you busy year-round, and a culture that generally respects self-reliance and independence.

The veteran benefits here are all over the map. Some states (Oklahoma, we see you) punch way above their weight with aggressive tax exemptions. Others (looking at you, Wyoming) offer zero income tax but minimal veteran-specific benefits. A few (Colorado, Utah) are expensive but deliver quality of life that might justify the costs.

We're covering 12 states: Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Louisiana.

## #1: Oklahoma - The Unexpected Champion

**Winner:** Military retirement fully exempt, strong property tax relief for disabled vets, rock-bottom cost of living, decent VA care.

**Loser:** Tornado risk, limited job market, not much cultural variety.

Oklahoma doesn't usually make "best places to live" lists, but for veterans? It's genuinely excellent.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** 100% exempt from state income tax. All of it, no caps.
- **Disability pay:** Also fully exempt.
- **Property taxes:** 100% disabled veterans get total property tax exemption. Partial ratings get substantial relief.

This is an aggressive benefits package—on par with Florida and Texas.

### VA Healthcare

- **Oklahoma City VA Health Care System** (including the new hospital that opened recently) is solid and modern.
- **Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center** (Muskogee) serves eastern Oklahoma.
- **Lawton VA Clinic** serves southwest OK near Fort Sill.

Coverage is decent statewide, especially considering the state's size and population.

### Cost of Living

Oklahoma is **dirt cheap**. You can buy a house in Tulsa or Oklahoma City for under $200K. Property taxes are low (and exempt if you're 100% disabled). Gas is cheap. Food is cheap. Your retirement dollars go very far here.

### The Reality Check

Oklahoma is tornado alley—severe weather is a real risk. The economy is oil and gas dependent, which means boom-and-bust cycles. Cultural amenities are limited compared to larger cities.

But if you're looking for pure financial value and veteran benefits? Oklahoma is hard to beat.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want full military retirement tax exemption and low costs
- Disabled veterans who want property tax relief
- Anyone who loves wide-open spaces and doesn't need urban sophistication
- Folks who hunt, fish, or enjoy outdoor recreation

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone who hates tornadoes and severe weather
- Veterans seeking diverse job markets
- People who need cultural variety and urban amenities

**Bottom Line:** Oklahoma is a top-tier financial choice for veterans—full tax exemption, low costs, solid VA care. It's the surprise winner of this region.

## #2: Wyoming - Freedom and Wide-Open Spaces

**Winner:** No state income tax, stunning landscapes, personal freedom, low population density.

**Loser:** Very limited VA care, harsh winters, minimal veteran-specific benefits beyond no income tax.

Wyoming is the least populated state in the nation—and that's exactly the appeal for some people.

### Tax Treatment

- **No state income tax** (never has been, never will be).
- **No estate or inheritance tax.**
- **Property taxes:** Moderate rates, but veteran-specific exemptions are limited (disabled vets get some relief).

### VA Healthcare Reality

- **Cheyenne VA Medical Center** is the only full VA hospital in Wyoming.
- **Sheridan VA Medical Center** offers some services.
- Several small outpatient clinics scattered across the state.

If you need frequent or complex VA care, Wyoming is a problem. You'll be driving hours or traveling to Denver, Salt Lake City, or Billings.

### Cost of Living

Wyoming's cost of living varies—Jackson Hole and resort areas are insanely expensive. Cheyenne, Casper, and rural areas are moderate. Overall, it's not rock-bottom cheap, but it's reasonable.

### The Lifestyle Appeal

Wyoming is about wide-open spaces, self-reliance, and minimal government interference. If you want to own land, hunt, fish, and generally be left alone—Wyoming delivers.

Winters are brutal—wind, snow, and below-zero temps are common.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want no income tax and independence
- Anyone who loves outdoor recreation (hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing)
- Folks who want space and don't mind isolation
- Veterans who don't need much VA care

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone who needs robust VA healthcare
- Veterans who hate extreme cold and wind
- People who want cultural amenities and variety

**Bottom Line:** Wyoming is a lifestyle choice—no income tax and ultimate freedom, but you'll sacrifice VA access and pay for it with isolation and harsh weather.

## #3: Tennessee - Volunteer State Hospitality

**Winner:** No state income tax, growing economy, decent VA care, affordable living.

**Loser:** Property tax exemptions only for disabled vets, mixed quality of life across the state.

Tennessee has become a magnet for retirees and job seekers fleeing high-tax states—and veterans benefit too.

### Tax Treatment

- **No state income tax.**
- **Property taxes:** 100% disabled veterans get full property tax exemption. Others pay standard rates.

### VA Healthcare

- **VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System** (Nashville, Murfreesboro) is solid.
- **Memphis VA Medical Center** serves western Tennessee.
- **Mountain Home VA Medical Center** (near Johnson City) serves northeast Tennessee.

Coverage is decent statewide, with major facilities in the three largest metros.

### Cost of Living

Tennessee is affordable—especially outside Nashville (which has gotten expensive due to influx). Memphis, Chattanooga, Knoxville, and rural areas offer reasonable housing costs.

### The Economy

Tennessee has a booming economy—Nashville (healthcare, music, tourism), Memphis (logistics, FedEx hub), Chattanooga (tech startups), and statewide manufacturing. Job opportunities are strong.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want no income tax and a growing economy
- 100% disabled veterans who want full property tax exemption
- Anyone who likes southern culture and hospitality
- Folks seeking outdoor recreation (Smoky Mountains, lakes)

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans without disability ratings (no property tax relief)
- Anyone who hates heat and humidity (summers are brutal)
- People who want consistent quality across the state (rural areas lag significantly)

**Bottom Line:** Tennessee is a strong choice if you're disabled or just want no income tax with economic opportunity. It's grown rapidly for good reason.

## #4: Montana - Big Sky Country

**Winner:** Stunning landscapes, strong outdoor culture, partial tax exemption, safe communities.

**Loser:** Limited VA care, expensive housing (near resort areas), brutal winters.

Montana is gorgeous—if you've ever dreamed of living in a place that looks like a postcard, this is it.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $5,500. Not generous, but something.
- **Property taxes:** Moderate rates, but disabled veterans (with documentation) can get exemptions.

### VA Healthcare

- **VA Montana Health Care System** (Fort Harrison, near Helena) is the main facility.
- **Missoula VA Clinic** offers outpatient services.
- Miles City, Billings, and Kalispell have smaller clinics.

Rural Montana requires long drives for VA care—this is a real limitation if you have complex health needs.

### Cost of Living

Montana varies wildly—Bozeman, Missoula, and areas near Glacier National Park are expensive (influx of out-of-state buyers has driven prices up). Eastern Montana and smaller towns are more affordable.

### The Lifestyle

Montana is about outdoor recreation—hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing. If that's your priority, you'll love it. If you need urban amenities, you'll be frustrated.

Winters are long and cold. Summer is gorgeous but short.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who prioritize outdoor lifestyle above all else
- Anyone who wants low population density and stunning scenery
- Folks who can handle isolation and harsh winters
- Veterans who don't need frequent VA care

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone who needs robust VA healthcare
- Veterans on tight budgets (resort areas are expensive)
- People who want job opportunities (economy is limited outside tourism and natural resources)

**Bottom Line:** Montana is a lifestyle choice—come for the scenery and outdoor access, not the veteran benefits or VA care.

## #5: Kentucky - Bluegrass and Bourbon

**Winner:** Strong tax exemption (up to $40,670), good property tax relief for disabled vets, low cost of living, decent VA care.

**Loser:** Limited job market, rural areas lag on services, mixed quality of life.

Kentucky quietly offers a solid benefits package combined with low costs.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $40,670 (indexed annually). That covers most or all of many veterans' retirement income.
- **Property taxes:** Disabled veterans get exemptions ranging from $40,500 to full exemption depending on disability rating.

### VA Healthcare

- **Robley Rex VA Medical Center** (Louisville) is solid.
- **Lexington VA Medical Center** serves central Kentucky.
- Outpatient clinics in Bowling Green, Florence, and elsewhere.

Coverage is decent near Louisville and Lexington, weaker in rural areas.

### Cost of Living

Kentucky is cheap—you can buy a house for under $200K in most areas. Property taxes are low (and even lower with veteran exemptions). General living costs are low.

### Lifestyle Considerations

Louisville and Lexington offer urban amenities (bourbon distilleries, horse racing, decent food scenes). Rural Kentucky is beautiful but economically struggling in many areas.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want strong tax exemptions and low costs
- Disabled veterans seeking property tax relief
- Anyone who loves bourbon, horses, and southern culture
- Folks who want access to decent VA care without big-city chaos

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans seeking diverse job markets
- Anyone who wants cutting-edge amenities
- People who hate humidity and hot summers

**Bottom Line:** Kentucky is a solid mid-tier choice—good exemptions, low costs, decent VA care. It's practical if you like southern living.

## #6: Arkansas - Natural State, Natural Savings

**Winner:** Low cost of living (among the cheapest in the nation), disabled vets exempt from property tax, partial income tax exemption.

**Loser:** Limited VA care, weak economy, limited job opportunities.

Arkansas is dirt cheap—and if you're a disabled veteran, you get meaningful property tax relief.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $12,000. Not great, but helps.
- **Property taxes:** 100% disabled veterans are fully exempt. Partial ratings get some relief.

### VA Healthcare

- **Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System** (Little Rock, North Little Rock) is the main hub.
- **Fayetteville VA Clinic** serves northwest Arkansas.
- Rural areas require long drives.

### Cost of Living

Arkansas is one of the cheapest states in the nation. Housing is extremely affordable. Property taxes are low (and exempt if you're 100% disabled). You can live comfortably on a modest military retirement.

### The Economy

Arkansas is economically limited—Walmart and Tyson Foods dominate. Northwest Arkansas (Bentonville, Fayetteville) is growing due to Walmart's headquarters. The rest of the state is struggling.

### Who Should Move Here

- 100% disabled veterans who want full property tax exemption and ultra-low costs
- Anyone who wants to stretch retirement dollars as far as possible
- Folks who love outdoor recreation (Ozarks, Buffalo National River, lakes)
- Veterans who don't need frequent VA care

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans without disability ratings (benefits are modest)
- Anyone seeking job opportunities
- People who need urban amenities and variety

**Bottom Line:** Arkansas is a budget-friendly option for disabled veterans who prioritize low costs and don't need much beyond basic VA care.

## #7: Louisiana - Bayou Living

**Winner:** Strong tax exemption (up to $50,700), low cost of living, unique culture, decent VA care.

**Loser:** Hurricane risk, corruption reputation, aging infrastructure, heat and humidity.

Louisiana offers a unique lifestyle and surprisingly strong veteran tax benefits—but it comes with trade-offs.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $50,700. That's one of the higher caps in the nation and covers most military retirements entirely.
- **Property taxes:** Vary by parish; some offer disabled veteran exemptions.

### VA Healthcare

- **Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System** (New Orleans) is solid.
- **Overton Brooks VA Medical Center** (Shreveport) serves northwest Louisiana.
- **Alexandria VA Medical Center** covers central Louisiana.

Coverage is decent near major cities, weaker in rural bayou areas.

### Cost of Living

Louisiana is cheap—especially outside New Orleans. Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Lafayette, and rural areas offer very affordable housing. Property taxes are low.

### The Reality Check

Hurricane risk is real—Katrina, Laura, Ida, and others have devastated parts of the state. Insurance is expensive and sometimes hard to get.

Louisiana has a reputation for corruption and poor governance. Infrastructure (roads, utilities) is aging and often neglected.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want a high tax exemption and low costs
- Anyone who loves Cajun/Creole culture, food, and music
- Folks who enjoy fishing, hunting, and swamp life
- Veterans who can handle hurricane risk

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone averse to hurricanes and flooding
- Veterans who hate extreme heat and humidity
- People who need reliable infrastructure and governance

**Bottom Line:** Louisiana offers strong tax benefits and low costs, but hurricane risk and governance issues are real concerns.

## #8: Idaho - Gem State Growth

**Winner:** Strong tax exemption (up to $48,000), growing economy, outdoor recreation paradise, safe communities.

**Loser:** Limited VA care, rapid influx driving up costs, winters are cold.

Idaho has exploded in popularity—people are fleeing high-tax states (especially California) and driving up costs.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $48,000. That's a strong exemption that covers most military retirements.
- **Property taxes:** Moderate rates, limited veteran-specific exemptions.

### VA Healthcare

- **Boise VA Medical Center** is the main facility—decent but not large.
- Pocatello and Twin Falls have outpatient clinics.
- Rural Idaho requires long drives for care.

### Cost of Living

Idaho was cheap—now it's moderate and rising. Boise metro area has seen huge housing cost increases. Rural areas are still affordable but also more isolated.

### The Economy

Idaho's economy is growing—Boise has become a tech hub (Micron, startups). Agriculture and outdoor recreation also drive the economy.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want a strong tax exemption and outdoor lifestyle
- Anyone who loves skiing, hiking, hunting, fishing
- Folks seeking a safe, growing community
- Veterans who don't need frequent VA care

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone on a tight budget (costs are rising fast)
- Veterans who need robust VA healthcare
- People who hate cold winters

**Bottom Line:** Idaho offers strong tax exemptions and quality of life, but rapid growth is driving up costs. Move now if you're interested—it won't get cheaper.

## #9: Utah - Beehive State Benefits

**Winner:** Growing economy (tech, outdoor industry), safe communities, strong education system, decent VA care.

**Loser:** Tax exemption is capped at $43,260, rising costs, Utah culture may not fit everyone.

Utah has boomed economically and offers a high quality of life—but costs have risen accordingly.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $43,260. Decent, but anything above that is taxed.
- **Property taxes:** Moderate rates, modest veteran exemptions.

### VA Healthcare

- **VA Salt Lake City Health Care System** (George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center) is excellent—one of the better VA hospitals in the West.
- Outpatient clinics in Ogden, St. George, and elsewhere.

### Cost of Living

Utah has gotten expensive—especially along the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City, Provo, Ogden). Rural areas are more affordable but job opportunities are limited.

### The Economy

Utah's economy is strong—tech sector (Silicon Slopes), outdoor recreation industry, healthcare, and finance. Job opportunities are excellent.

### The Culture Factor

Utah is heavily influenced by LDS (Mormon) culture. Some veterans love the family-friendly, safe communities. Others feel like outsiders. It's very much a personal fit question.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans transitioning into tech or outdoor industry careers
- Anyone who prioritizes safety, education, and quality of life
- Folks who love skiing, hiking, and outdoor recreation
- Veterans who fit or don't mind the cultural environment

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone on a tight budget (costs are high)
- Veterans who may clash with conservative, religious culture
- People who want maximum tax exemptions (the cap is moderate)

**Bottom Line:** Utah offers quality of life and economic opportunity, but costs are high and the culture isn't for everyone.

---

## #10: New Mexico - Land of Enchantment

**Winner:** Low cost of living, good property tax relief for disabled vets, unique culture, decent VA care.

**Loser:** Weak income tax exemption, economic struggles, crime issues in certain areas.

New Mexico offers stunning landscapes and low costs—but the veteran benefits are mixed.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $10,000. That's weak—one of the lowest caps around.
- **Property taxes:** Disabled veterans (at least 50% rating) get exemptions ranging from $4,000 to full exemption depending on income and rating.

### VA Healthcare

- **New Mexico VA Health Care System** (Albuquerque) is solid.
- Outpatient clinics in Santa Fe, Farmington, Las Cruces, and elsewhere.

Coverage is decent near population centers, limited in rural areas.

### Cost of Living

New Mexico is cheap—housing is affordable outside Santa Fe (which is pricey). Property taxes are low (and even lower for disabled vets). You can live comfortably on a modest income.

### The Reality Check

New Mexico has economic struggles—poverty rates are high, job opportunities are limited outside Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Crime is a concern in certain areas.

### Who Should Move Here

- Disabled veterans who'll benefit from property tax exemptions
- Anyone who loves desert landscapes and Southwest culture
- Folks who want low costs and don't need robust job markets
- Veterans who enjoy outdoor recreation (hiking, skiing)

### Who Should Avoid It

- High-earning retirees (the $10K cap is pathetic)
- Anyone who prioritizes safety (crime is an issue in some areas)
- Veterans seeking strong economies and job opportunities

**Bottom Line:** New Mexico is a budget-friendly option for disabled veterans, but the income tax exemption is weak and the economy is struggling.

---

## #11: Colorado - Rocky Mountain High (Costs)

**Winner:** Stunning landscapes, booming economy, outdoor recreation paradise, decent VA care.

**Loser:** High cost of living, modest tax exemption, expensive housing.

Colorado is gorgeous and economically strong—but you'll pay a premium for both.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $30,000. That's better than nothing, but it's not great for high-earning retirees.
- **Property taxes:** Relatively low rates (thanks to TABOR law), but veteran-specific exemptions are limited.

### VA Healthcare

- **Eastern Colorado Health Care System** (Denver, Aurora) is solid.
- **Grand Junction VA Medical Center** serves western Colorado.
- Coverage is decent near population centers.

### Cost of Living

Colorado is expensive—especially along the Front Range (Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins). Mountain resort towns are insanely pricey. You can find affordable areas in rural eastern Colorado, but then you lose access to everything that makes Colorado appealing.

### The Economy

Colorado's economy is booming—tech, aerospace, outdoor recreation, healthcare, and energy. Job opportunities are excellent, especially in Denver metro.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans transitioning into high-paying tech or aerospace jobs
- Anyone who prioritizes outdoor recreation above all else (skiing, hiking, mountain biking)
- Folks who can afford the costs and value quality of life
- Veterans who need decent VA care

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (costs will hurt)
- Veterans seeking maximum tax exemptions (the $30K cap is weak)
- Anyone who wants affordability

**Bottom Line:** Colorado offers incredible lifestyle and job opportunities—but it's expensive, and the veteran benefits don't justify the costs unless you're earning civilian income.

---

## #12: West Virginia - Mountain State Struggles

**Winner:** Very low cost of living, some tax exemption, beautiful Appalachian landscapes.

**Loser:** Weak tax exemption (capped at $20,000), very limited VA care, economic depression, health issues.

West Virginia is cheap—but there are reasons for that.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $20,000. That's weak for anyone with a decent retirement.
- **Property taxes:** Low rates, but veteran-specific exemptions are limited.

### VA Healthcare

- **Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center** (Clarksburg) is the main facility.
- Martinsburg and Beckley have VA facilities.
- Rural areas require long drives.

### Cost of Living

West Virginia is one of the cheapest states in the nation. You can buy a house for under $100K in many areas. But the trade-off is economic decline, limited job opportunities, and health issues (West Virginia ranks near the bottom in life expectancy and health outcomes).

### The Reality

West Virginia has serious economic and social problems—opioid crisis, population decline, lack of opportunities. It's beautiful scenery, but the state is struggling.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want absolute rock-bottom costs
- Anyone who loves Appalachian mountains and doesn't need services
- Folks who are self-sufficient and don't mind isolation

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans seeking meaningful tax exemptions (the $20K cap is weak)
- Anyone who needs VA care, job opportunities, or reliable infrastructure
- People who prioritize health outcomes and quality of life

**Bottom Line:** West Virginia is cheap for a reason. Only move here if you have strong personal ties or want to live off the grid in the mountains.

## The Mountain West & Plains Bottom Line

This region is about trade-offs—outdoor lifestyle versus services, independence versus convenience, low costs versus job opportunities.

**The standouts:**

- **Oklahoma** – Full military retirement exemption, low costs, solid VA care. Best overall pick in the region.
- **Wyoming** – No income tax, ultimate freedom, but very limited VA care.
- **Tennessee** – No income tax, growing economy, decent VA care.
- **Montana** – Stunning scenery and outdoor lifestyle, but weak exemptions and limited VA care.

**The surprises:**

- **Kentucky** and **Louisiana** offer strong tax exemptions that fly under the radar.
- **Idaho** and **Utah** are growing fast but getting expensive.

**The disappointments:**

- **Colorado** is gorgeous but expensive with weak exemptions.
- **West Virginia** is cheap but offers minimal benefits and limited services.

If you prioritize outdoor recreation and can handle isolation, this region delivers unmatched access to hunting, fishing, hiking, and space. If you need robust VA care and urban amenities, focus on Oklahoma, Tennessee, or cities in Colorado/Utah.

**The Mountain West and Plains won't coddle you—but they'll give you space, freedom, and (in some cases) solid financial benefits.**
