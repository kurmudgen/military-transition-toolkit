# Connecticut Veterans: Healthcare Facilities, Education Benefits & Job Resources

Connecticut is home to approximately 135,600 veterans—about 4.6% of the state's adult civilian population. Despite being the third-smallest state geographically, Connecticut operates world-class VA healthcare facilities, offers generous education benefits, and hosts major defense contractors actively hiring veterans.

The state's compact size is a hidden advantage: nowhere in Connecticut is more than 90 minutes from a VA medical center. Combined with strong veteran support infrastructure and the submarine community at Groton, Connecticut offers unique advantages for veterans—though the high cost of living remains a significant challenge.

This guide provides actual addresses, phone numbers, and actionable information for Connecticut veterans navigating healthcare, education, and employment.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Healthcare**: 1 major VA medical center (West Haven), 1 specialty campus (Newington), 8 community-based clinics, and 2 state veterans homes—excellent coverage for a small state

**Education**: State tuition waiver program covering full tuition at public colleges/universities, strong Yellow Ribbon participation at UConn, 100% in-state tuition for GI Bill users

**Employment**: Electric Boat hiring 3,000+ in 2025, Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky, state hiring preference, strong submarine industry presence

**Veteran Population Hotspots**: Fairfield County (Stamford/Bridgeport area), Hartford County, New London County (submarine base community)

**Biggest advantage**: Small state means excellent healthcare access—West Haven VAMC serves entire state effectively

**Biggest challenge**: High cost of living (21.6% above national average) impacts even veterans with strong employment

**Eligibility Requirements**:
- Honorably discharged or released under honorable conditions
- Served 90+ days active duty during wartime OR separated earlier due to service-connected disability

4. Submit completed application to your school's financial aid office

**Annual renewal**: Yes, must reapply each academic year

**Contact**: Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs at (860) 616-3600 or your County Veterans Service Office

### Post-9/11 GI Bill - In-State Tuition for Veterans

All Connecticut public universities must offer in-state tuition to veterans using GI Bill benefits, regardless of residency status (if enrolled within 3 years of discharge and living in Connecticut while attending).
