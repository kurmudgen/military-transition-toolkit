# VA Disability Rating for Hypertension: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Hypertension (high blood pressure) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 7101** with ratings of **10%, 20%, 40%, or 60%**. Most veterans receive **10%** (requiring medication for control). The challenge is proving **service connection**—either showing onset during service or establishing secondary connection to PTSD, sleep apnea, obesity, or Agent Orange/herbicide exposure. Hypertension is also presumptive for certain Vietnam veterans with herbicide exposure. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Hypertension?

Hypertension is persistently elevated blood pressure. For VA purposes:
- **Hypertension**: Diastolic 90+ OR systolic 160+ on multiple readings
- **Stage 1**: 140-159 systolic or 90-99 diastolic
- **Stage 2**: 160+ systolic or 100+ diastolic

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Elevated readings documented during service
- First diagnosis during service
- Service conditions contributing to hypertension

**Presumptive (Agent Orange):**
Hypertension is presumptively associated with herbicide exposure for Vietnam veterans under recent VA policy changes.

**Secondary service connection:**
- **PTSD**: Chronic stress elevates BP
- **Sleep apnea**: Strong correlation
- **Obesity**: From service-connected conditions
- **Diabetes**: Often co-occurs
- **Kidney disease**: Affects BP regulation

## VA Rating Criteria

Hypertension is rated under **38 CFR § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more; OR systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more; OR minimum evaluation for individual with history of diastolic 100+ who requires continuous medication for control |
| **20%** | Diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more; OR systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more |
| **40%** | Diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more |
| **60%** | Diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more |

### Key Points

- **"Predominantly"**: Most readings, not just occasional spikes
- **Medication requirement**: If you need continuous medication for control, minimum 10%
- **Controlled BP still ratable**: Even if medication controls your BP, you're still rated

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing elevated BP
- In-service diagnosis
- Evidence of herbicide exposure (for Vietnam veterans)
- Nexus to service-connected condition

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Current BP readings
- Diagnosis of hypertension
- Medication records

### Severity Evidence
- Multiple BP readings documenting levels
- Treatment records
- Complications documented

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Take multiple BP readings
2. Review medication history
3. Assess complications
4. Review medical records

**Tips:**
- Don't drink caffeine before exam
- Be well-rested
- List all BP medications
- Bring recent BP readings if you monitor at home

## Secondary Conditions

**Hypertension commonly secondary to:**
- PTSD (chronic stress)
- Sleep apnea (very common connection)
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Kidney disease

**Hypertension can cause:**
- Heart conditions
- Kidney disease
- Stroke
- Vision problems

## Personal Statement Template

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if my BP is controlled by medication?
You still receive at least 10% if you require continuous medication for control.

### Is hypertension presumptive for Agent Orange exposure?
Yes. VA now recognizes hypertension as presumptively associated with herbicide exposure for Vietnam veterans.

### Can I claim hypertension secondary to PTSD?
Yes. Chronic stress from PTSD elevates blood pressure. This is a recognized secondary connection.

### Do I need elevated readings at the exam?
Not necessarily if you're on medication. The key is showing you need medication for control and documenting your uncontrolled readings.
