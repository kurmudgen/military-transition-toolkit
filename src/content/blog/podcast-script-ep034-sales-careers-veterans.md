Your military experience valued - discipline, follow-through, understanding customer missions.

**Why Veterans Excel in Sales:**

Sales is convincing someone to take action toward objective. You've done this. Convincing commander to approve plan. Convincing supply to expedite equipment. Convincing junior personnel to execute difficult tasks. All sales.

Top sales skills: relationship building, understanding customer needs, persistence, handling rejection, following process, presenting solutions professionally. You have these from military. Plus - veterans known for integrity, follow-through, discipline. B2B buyers trust veterans because you don't BS, you deliver what you promise, you understand their business challenges (especially if they're government/defense).

**Medical Device Sales:**

Selling surgical equipment, imaging systems, hospital technology, medical devices to hospitals, clinics, surgeons.

**Compensation:** Entry $70K-$80K base, $90K-$100K total (with commission). Experienced $92K-$183K. Top performers $400K+. Commission 30-50% of total pay. Average bonus $60K annually. Specialty areas (cardiac devices, orthopedic implants) $80K-$175K.

**The Role:** Build relationships with surgeons and hospital administrators. Demonstrate products. Attend surgeries to provide technical support. Solve clinical problems with your products. Long sales cycles (3-12 months) but large deals ($50K-$500K+).

**Why Veterans Fit:** You're comfortable in high-pressure medical environments (combat first aid, working with medics). You understand technical equipment. You remain calm in operating rooms. You build trust with doctors (similar to working with officers - respect rank, demonstrate competence). Your attention to detail and following protocols matches medical environment.

**Entry Path:** Medical sales training programs exist - Medical Sales College ($4,000-$10,000 courses). OR apply directly emphasizing military technical experience and relationship building. Companies: Stryker, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Zimmer Biomet, Johnson & Johnson. Many hire veterans specifically.

**Software/SaaS Sales:**

Selling software solutions to businesses. Enterprise software, cloud services, business applications.

**Compensation:**
- Inside Sales Rep / SDR: $60K base, $118K OTE (on-target earnings with commission)
- Mid-Market Account Executive: $75K base, $120K-$140K OTE
- Enterprise Account Executive: $110K base, $180K-$220K OTE
- Commission typically 10% of contract value

**The Role:** Prospecting (finding potential customers), qualifying leads, demonstrating software, negotiating contracts, managing accounts. Faster sales cycles than medical device (1-6 months). Multiple deals per quarter. SaaS is subscription model - you earn commission on renewals too.

**Why Veterans Fit:** Understanding complex systems (military IT, command and control systems). Presenting to decision-makers (briefing commanders). Managing multiple simultaneous priorities (operations tempo). Following sales process (like military planning process). Your ability to learn technical products quickly valued.

**Entry Path:** Start as SDR (Sales Development Rep) - outbound prospecting, qualifying leads. $60K-$80K. Prove yourself 12-18 months, promote to Account Executive. OR enter directly as AE if you have relevant experience. Companies hiring veterans: Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, countless smaller SaaS companies.

**Pharmaceutical Sales:**

Selling prescription drugs to doctors, pharmacies, hospitals.

**Compensation:** Average $68K-$85K base. Total comp $160K+ with bonuses/commissions. Range $44K-$109K. Specialty pharmaceutical reps (oncology, immunology) $129K average. Car allowance typical ($500-$800/month).

**The Role:** Territory management (visiting doctors offices in your region). Educating physicians on your drugs. Providing samples. Building relationships with medical practices. Track prescribing data. Formula-driven (companies track prescription volume by territory).

**Why Veterans Fit:** Territory management like AOR (area of responsibility). Relationship building with authority figures (doctors). Following compliance regulations (like military regulations). Handling rejection professionally (most sales calls don't result in immediate prescriptions). Discipline to work independently without direct supervision.

**Entry Path:** Bachelor's degree typically required (any major). Pharmacy tech experience helps but not required. Companies: Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly. Apply emphasizing military discipline, territory management, relationship building.

**B2B Industrial/Technology Sales:**

Selling equipment, technology, services to businesses. Could be: construction equipment, manufacturing systems, cybersecurity services, logistics solutions, facility management services.

**Compensation:** Wide range based on industry. $65K-$150K+ depending on product complexity and deal size. Commission 5-15% typical. Six-figure income achievable with established book of business.

**The Role:** Understanding customer business challenges. Proposing solutions. Technical presentations. Contract negotiation. Account management. Often selling into industries you know - construction (engineers), logistics (motor transport), security (MPs/security forces).

**Why Veterans Fit:** You understand these industries from military side. Selling to government/defense contractors? You know the customer better than civilian competitors. You speak their language. Major advantage.

**Entry Path:** Target industries related to your MOS. Combat engineer? Sell construction equipment or engineering services. Motor transport? Sell logistics solutions or fleet management. IT? Sell cybersecurity or IT services. Your technical knowledge immediate credibility.

**Common Entry: Inside Sales to Field Sales:**

Most sales careers start inside (phone/video sales) then move to field (in-person). Inside sales less travel, lower pressure, learn the business. $50K-$80K. Field sales more autonomy, higher earning potential, more travel. $80K-$200K+.

Don't dismiss inside sales as "call center." Modern inside sales is professional consultative selling via phone/video. Good training ground. Many top field reps started inside.

**Sales Training and Development:**

**Company-Provided:** Most companies provide excellent sales training. They invest in your development because successful reps make them money. Training typically 1-3 months before you carry quota. Covers: product knowledge, sales methodology, CRM systems, territory management.

**External Programs:**
- Medical Sales College: $4K-$10K programs for medical device sales
- Aspireship: Free SaaS sales training with job placement
- BreakInto.Tech: Tech sales bootcamps
- Sandler Training, Challenger Sale, SPIN Selling: Sales methodologies

**Military Skills Emphasis:**

On resume and interviews, emphasize:
- Relationship building with diverse stakeholders
- Presenting to senior decision-makers (briefing officers)
- Managing complex projects to completion (mission planning and execution)
- Handling high-pressure situations (combat operations if applicable, or stressful training)
- Territory management (if applicable to your MOS)
- Technical aptitude (learning complex equipment/systems)
- Integrity and following ethical guidelines

**Reality Check:**

Sales has rejection. You'll hear "no" far more than "yes." Typical close rates 10-30% depending on product. You need resilience. Military taught you this - you took casualties, had missions fail, received criticism. You adapted and continued. Same in sales.

Sales often has uncertainty. Commission-based income varies month to month. Bad quarter happens. But good sales reps consistently hit quota and earn well. First year challenging while learning. Year 2-3 you hit stride. Year 5+ you're top performer earning $150K-$300K+ depending on industry.

**Work-Life Balance:**

Better than military but you work. 45-55 hours typical. Some evening/weekend work (especially medical device - surgeries scheduled weekends). Travel varies - medical device heavy travel (50%+), pharma moderate (30-40%), inside sales minimal (0-10%).

But you control your schedule more than military. No formations, no 24-hour duty, no deployments. Most sales reps value autonomy and earning potential over traditional 9-5 structure.

**Starting Strategy:**

**Option 1 - Medical Device (highest pay, most competitive):** Take medical sales training course ($4K-$10K) OR apply directly emphasizing military technical and medical experience (if combat medic/corpsman). Target Stryker, Medtronic, Boston Scientific. Expect competitive interview process. Start $90K-$100K total comp. Timeline: 3-6 months.

**Option 2 - SaaS/Tech (fastest growing, most opportunities):** Apply for SDR roles at tech companies. Many hire veterans specifically. Use programs like Aspireship (free) or BreakInto.Tech. Start $60K-$80K, promote to AE within 18 months at $120K-$140K. Timeline: 1-3 months to SDR role.

**Option 3 - Industry You Know:** Target sales roles in industries related to your MOS. Your technical knowledge immediate advantage. Apply directly highlighting military experience in that field. Start $65K-$90K depending on industry. Timeline: 2-4 months.

**Geographic Considerations:**

Sales jobs everywhere but compensation varies:
- Tech hubs (SF, Seattle, Austin, Boston): SaaS sales $120K-$220K
- Medical centers (any major city): Medical device $90K-$183K
- Pharma: Nationwide, consistent comp $68K-$160K
- Industrial B2B: Based on customer concentration

Many sales roles now remote (especially SaaS inside sales). Field sales requires being in territory but you choose where you live within it.
