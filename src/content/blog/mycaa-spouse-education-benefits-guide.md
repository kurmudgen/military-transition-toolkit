# MyCAA Spouse Education Benefits: Complete Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

MyCAA (Military Spouse Career Advancement Accounts) provides up to **$4,000 in education funding** for eligible military spouses pursuing portable career training. You can use it for certifications, licenses, and some degree programs in high-demand fields. Eligibility is limited to **spouses of E1-E5, W1-W2, and O1-O2 active duty members**. The program is fully funded (no repayment required), and application is straightforward. If you're eligible, this is free money for career advancement—use it.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

MyCAA directly addresses the military spouse employment crisis:
- **22% unemployment rate** for military spouses
- **50%+ underemployment** rate
- Career disruption with each PCS
- State licensing barriers
