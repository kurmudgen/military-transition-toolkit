# New Hampshire Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

New Hampshire operates one VA medical center in Manchester serving the entire state, plus multiple community-based outpatient clinics in Somersworth, Conway, Tilton, Peterborough, and Littleton. The Manchester VAMC provides comprehensive care, though wait times can be longer for specialty services. About 85% of NH veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care.

For education, the University of New Hampshire participates in Yellow Ribbon (amount varies), offers reduced tuition for military-affiliated students, and has strong veteran support services. New Hampshire's standout benefit is free tuition at state community colleges for children of 100% disabled veterans, POW/MIA, or Medal of Honor recipients—one of the best state education programs nationally.

Employment is excellent, with New Hampshire having the **lowest veteran unemployment rate in America at 0.2%** (2024 data). The state's overall unemployment is just 2.5%, and major employers actively recruit veterans. Governor Kelly Ayotte signed an executive order in 2025 giving veterans precedence in state government hiring.

Overall rating: **7/10** for healthcare (limited to one medical center but good quality), **9/10** for education (exceptional state benefits), **9.5/10** for employment (best veteran unemployment rate nationally).

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- 85% of NH veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care
- Urban access (Manchester, Nashua, Concord): Good—30-45 minutes to Manchester VAMC or clinic
- Rural access: Moderate—clinics in Conway, Littleton, Tilton serve northern/rural areas, but specialty care requires Manchester trip

**Quality Ratings:**
- Manchester VAMC: Average (3 stars)
- Patient satisfaction has improved with recent facility upgrades
- Strong primary care and mental health programs

**Wait Times:**
- Primary care: 15-25 days (meets VA's 20-day standard)
- Mental health: 20-30 days
- Specialty care: 30-50 days (cardiology and orthopedics run longer)

**Areas for improvement:** Only one medical center for entire state means veterans in northern NH (Berlin, Colebrook) drive 2+ hours for specialty care. Community Care referrals help, but rural access remains a challenge.

### Community Care (Non-VA Options)

New Hampshire has excellent Community Care networks:

- **Eligibility:** If you live 40+ miles from VA, wait times exceed 28 days, or service isn't available
- **Networks:** Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Catholic Medical Center, Elliot Hospital, Wentworth-Douglass
- **Coverage:** VA authorizes and pays for care at civilian facilities
