# Gait Disturbance Secondary to Lower Extremity Conditions: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** COMPLICATED - Gait issues often support OTHER claims
- **Key Understanding:** Gait disturbance itself may not be separately rated
- **Strategic Value:** Documents impact and supports adjacent joint claims
- **When It's Rated:** As part of lower extremity ratings, or under neurological codes
- **Better Approach:** Use gait evidence to support claims for conditions CAUSED by gait abnormality

**Important:** Gait disturbance is often the EVIDENCE you need for other claims, not the claim itself.

## Understanding Gait Disturbance Claims

### What Is Gait Disturbance?

**Types of Abnormal Gait:**
- **Antalgic gait:** Limping due to pain
- **Trendelenburg gait:** Hip weakness causing pelvic drop
- **Ataxic gait:** Unsteady, wide-based (often from TBI/neurological)
- **Spastic gait:** Stiff, dragging feet
- **Shuffling gait:** Short steps, limited foot clearance

### Is Gait Separately Rated?

**Usually No:**
- Gait problems from joint conditions are considered in the joint rating
- The VA doesn't have a specific "gait disturbance" rating code

**Can Be Rated When:**
- Neurological cause (separate from joint issues)
- TBI-related balance/gait problems
- So severe it constitutes "loss of use" of extremity

### Strategic Use of Gait Evidence

**Gait abnormality SUPPORTS:**
- Adjacent joint secondary claims (hip, knee, back)
- Higher ratings for the causative condition
- TDIU claims (employability impact)
- Mobility device needs (wheelchair, cane)

## How Lower Extremity Conditions Cause Gait Issues

### Knee Conditions

**Gait Effects:**
- Antalgic gait (shortened stance phase on affected side)
- Hyperextension to "lock" knee
- Circumduction to avoid bending knee
- Decreased stride length

**Secondary Effects:**
- Hip strain from compensation
- Back pain from pelvic imbalance
- Contralateral knee stress
- Falls/balance problems

### Hip Conditions

**Gait Effects:**
- Trendelenburg gait (hip drop)
- Circumduction gait
- Shortened step length
- Trunk lean toward affected side

**Secondary Effects:**
- Lumbar spine stress
- Contralateral hip/knee problems
- Fall risk
- Core muscle fatigue

### Ankle/Foot Conditions

**Gait Effects:**
- Toe walking or heel walking
- Foot drop (slapping gait)
- Inversion/eversion abnormalities
- Shortened stride

**Secondary Effects:**
- Knee hyperextension
- Hip compensation
- Lower back strain
- Fall risk

## How to Use Gait Evidence Strategically

### Strategy 1: Support Adjacent Joint Claims

Use gait abnormality as evidence for:
- Hip problems secondary to knee condition
- Knee problems secondary to ankle condition
- Back problems secondary to hip condition

**Example:**
"Due to service-connected knee arthritis, [Veteran] has developed antalgic gait which has resulted in secondary hip arthritis from compensatory movement patterns."

### Strategy 2: Support Increased Rating

Document gait problems to support higher rating for causative condition:
- Shows functional impairment
- Demonstrates severity
- Supports "marked interference with employment"

### Strategy 3: Support TDIU

Gait disturbance affecting employability:
- Unable to stand/walk as required
- Safety concerns
- Use of assistive devices

### Strategy 4: Claim Conditions CAUSED BY Gait

Instead of claiming "gait disturbance," claim:
- Falls and resulting injuries
- Back condition from compensation
- Opposite leg condition from overuse

## When Gait CAN Be Rated Separately

### Neurological Gait Disorders

If gait disturbance is from neurological cause, separate from joint:

**TBI-Related:**
- Ataxic gait
- Balance deficits
- Coordination problems
- Rated under TBI residuals or by analogy

**Peripheral Neuropathy:**
- Foot drop
- Sensory ataxia
- Rated under neurological codes

### Vestibualar Disorders

Balance problems from inner ear:
- Meniere's disease
- Vestibular dysfunction
- Rated under DC 6204-6205

### Severe Cases: Loss of Use

If gait is so impaired that limb has effectively no function:
- May qualify for SMC (Special Monthly Compensation)
- "Loss of use" of foot, leg, etc.
- Very high threshold to meet

## VA Rating Criteria (Related Conditions)

### Lower Extremity Ratings That Include Gait

Gait problems are considered in these ratings:

**Knee (DC 5256-5263):**
- Ratings include functional impairment
- Gait evidence supports higher rating

**Hip (DC 5250-5255):**
- Limitation of motion affects gait
- Trendelenburg sign documented

**Ankle (DC 5270-5274):**
- Limitation affects push-off, stability
- Gait changes documented

### Neurological Ratings

**Foot Drop/Peroneal Nerve (DC 8521):**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 30% | Severe incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Complete paralysis (foot drop, loss of dorsiflexion) |

**Sciatic Nerve (DC 8520):**
| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Moderately severe incomplete paralysis |
| 60% | Severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy |
| 80% | Complete paralysis |

## Evidence You Need

### Gait Documentation

**Video Evidence (Powerful):**
- Video of your gait
- Shows examiner exactly how you walk
- Document good days and bad days
- Smartphone video acceptable

**Professional Evaluation:**
- Physical therapy gait analysis
- Orthopedic examination notes
- Podiatry evaluation
- Neurology examination (if neurological)

### Medical Records

**Must Document:**
- Description of gait abnormality
- Causative condition
- Impact on function
- Need for assistive devices (cane, walker, etc.)

### Nexus Letter (For Secondary Claims)

**If claiming secondary conditions from gait:**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for [knee arthritis] at [X]%. Physical examination reveals antalgic gait with shortened stance phase on the right lower extremity.*

*[Veteran] has developed [hip arthritis/back pain/etc.] secondary to this abnormal gait pattern.*

*It is my opinion that the chronic compensatory movement required by [Veteran's] antalgic gait has resulted in [secondary condition]. The biomechanical chain from knee dysfunction to hip/back stress is well-documented in orthopedic literature."*

## Step-by-Step Process

### For Supporting Adjacent Joint Claims

1. **Document your gait abnormality** - PT evaluation, video
2. **Get diagnosed with secondary condition** - Hip, back, opposite leg
3. **Obtain nexus linking gait to secondary condition**
4. **File secondary claim for that condition**

### For Supporting Increased Rating

1. **Document gait problems in treatment records**
2. **Note functional limitations**
3. **File for increase on causative condition**
4. **At C&P, demonstrate gait abnormality**

### For Neurological Gait Issues

1. **Get neurological evaluation**
2. **Document specific nerve involvement**
3. **File claim under appropriate neurological code**
4. **Provide nexus to service-connected cause (TBI, diabetes, etc.)**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Claiming "gait disturbance" alone** - Not separately rated in most cases

2. **Not documenting gait** - Need written descriptions, ideally video

3. **Missing secondary conditions** - Gait causes other problems; claim those

4. **Not using for employment impact** - Key evidence for TDIU

5. **Forgetting assistive devices** - Document cane, walker, orthotics use

6. **Not requesting PT evaluation** - Objective gait analysis valuable

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Using Gait for Hip Claim

**Background:** 52-year-old veteran, 30% right knee arthritis
- Marked antalgic gait documented
- Developed right hip pain
- PT noted compensatory hip stress

**Strategy:** Claimed hip arthritis secondary to knee, using gait evidence

**Evidence:**
- PT gait analysis showing compensation
- Hip imaging showing arthritic changes
- Nexus linking gait pattern to hip damage

**Outcome:** 10% for right hip
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 40%

### Case Study 2: Foot Drop from Diabetes

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, diabetes service-connected
- Developed foot drop (peroneal nerve damage)
- Slapping gait, cannot dorsiflex foot
- Uses AFO brace

**Strategy:** Claimed peripheral neuropathy affecting peroneal nerve

**Evidence:**
- EMG showing nerve damage
- Physical exam documenting foot drop
- Nexus to diabetes

**Outcome:** 30% for peroneal nerve (severe incomplete paralysis)
**Total Increase:** Combined rating increased significantly

### Case Study 3: Back Claim from Bilateral Knee Issues

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, bilateral knee conditions (20% each)
- Significant gait abnormality
- Developed lumbar pain
- MRI shows disc degeneration

**Strategy:** Claimed lumbar DDD secondary to bilateral knee conditions

**Evidence:**
- Documented gait abnormality
- Biomechanical nexus explaining spine stress
- Medical literature on gait compensation

**Outcome:** 20% for lumbar spine
**Combined Rating:** Increased to 50%

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get rated just for limping?**
A: Generally no. Limping is considered in the condition causing it. Use gait as evidence for other claims.

**Q: My gait is really bad—isn't that worth something?**
A: Yes, but as evidence. It supports higher ratings, secondary claims, and TDIU.

**Q: Should I get a formal gait analysis?**
A: Very helpful for claims. Physical therapy can provide this.

**Q: What if I use a cane?**
A: Document this. Shows severity and supports functional impairment.

**Q: Can gait problems support TDIU?**
A: Absolutely. If you can't walk/stand as required for work, document this.

**Q: What about balance problems from TBI?**
A: These CAN be separately rated under TBI residuals or vestibular codes.

**Q: How do I document gait for the VA?**
A: Video yourself walking. Have provider describe gait in records. PT evaluation.
