## Value Perception Analysis

### What Veterans Will Pay For:
1. ✅ **Expert human review** - VA claims, resume, LinkedIn ($49-149)
2. ✅ **1-on-1 coaching** - Career guidance, interview prep ($99-299)
3. ✅ **Time savings** - Tools that automate tedious work
4. ✅ **Confidence** - Practice, feedback, preparation
5. ✅ **Outcomes** - Features that directly lead to job offers, benefits approvals

### What Veterans Won't Pay For:
1. ❌ **Basic information** - Articles, guides (expect free)
2. ❌ **Job boards** - Accustomed to free listings
3. ❌ **Community access** - Peer forums should be free
4. ❌ **Checklists/templates** - Basic tools expected free
5. ❌ **Paywalls on essentials** - VA claims info, benefits data

### Price Sensitivity:
- **Transitioning veterans** are often on tight budgets (military pay → civilian gap)
- **BUT** willing to pay for **proven ROI** (e.g., $149 VA claims help if it unlocks $1000/month disability)
- **Price anchoring:** CareerProPlus charges $300-800 for resume = MTT's $49 feels like steal
- **Free tier essential:** Must offer robust free version to build trust and adoption
