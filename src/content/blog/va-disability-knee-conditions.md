## Understanding Knee Condition VA Ratings

Knee conditions are rated under 38 CFR § 4.71a, with various diagnostic codes depending on the specific condition. Ratings are primarily based on range of motion limitations, instability, pain on use, and functional impairment.

### Common Knee Diagnostic Codes

**DC 5257:** Knee impairment (limitation of extension or flexion)
**DC 5258:** Cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion
**DC 5259:** Cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with recurrent subluxation or laxity
**DC 5260:** Knee ankylosis (complete immobility)
**DC 5261:** Thigh, limitation of extension (often used for total knee replacement)

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

## Common Knee Conditions and Service Connection

### 1. **Knee Arthritis (Osteoarthritis, Degenerative Joint Disease)**
**Most Common Knee Condition**

**Causes:**
- Direct service injury
- Overuse from military training/duties
- Secondary to instability from ligament injury
- Traumatic arthritis from knee injury

**Service Connection Paths:**
- Direct: Arthritis began during or shortly after service
- Secondary: Arthritis developed from service-connected knee injury
- Aggravation: Pre-existing arthritis worsened by service

**Evidence Needed:**
- X-rays showing arthritis (joint space narrowing, bone spurs)
- Range of motion limitations
- Pain with use
- Functional impact

### 2. **Meniscus Tears (Cartilage Damage)**
**Very Common, Especially in Combat Arms**

**Diagnostic Code:** 5258 or 5259

**Symptoms:**
- Knee locking or catching
- Pain with twisting
- Swelling after activity
- "Giving way" sensation

**Service Connection:**
- Injury during service (sports, training, combat)
- Often requires MRI for diagnosis
- May or may not have surgery

**Rating Based On:**
- Frequency of locking, pain, effusion (swelling)
- With surgery: residual symptoms
- Without surgery: current symptoms

### 3. **ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) Tear**

**Diagnostic Code:** 5257 (instability) or 5259

**Symptoms:**
- Knee instability, "giving way"
- Swelling
- Pain
- Difficulty with cutting/pivoting movements

**Service Connection:**
- Sports injury during service
- Training accident

### 4. **PCL, MCL, LCL (Other Ligament) Injuries**

**Symptoms:**
- Instability in various directions
- Pain
- Swelling
- Functional limitations

**Rating:**
- Based on degree of instability (moderate to severe)

- Chondromalacia patella (cartilage damage under kneecap)
- Patellar subluxation/dislocation
- Patellofemoral syndrome

**Symptoms:**
- Anterior knee pain
- Pain with stairs (especially down)
- Kneecap instability

**Rating:**
- Based on functional impairment
- Often lower ratings (10-20%)

### 6. **Total Knee Replacement**

**Rating:**
- Minimum 30% for total knee replacement under DC 5261
- Can be higher based on residual symptoms and ROM limitations
- Often 30-60% depending on outcome

---

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Medical Diagnosis and Imaging

**Required:**
- Medical records documenting knee condition
- Imaging studies:
  - **X-rays:** Show arthritis, bone damage, alignment
  - **MRI:** Show soft tissue (meniscus, ligaments, cartilage)
  - **CT scan:** Sometimes used for complex fractures
- Orthopedic evaluation

**Diagnosis Should Include:**
- Specific condition (arthritis, meniscus tear, ligament injury, etc.)
- Which knee (left, right, or both)
- Severity
- Treatment provided/recommended

### 2. Range of Motion Measurements

**Critical for Rating**

**Normal Knee Range of Motion:**
- **Flexion (bending):** 0-140 degrees
- **Extension (straightening):** 0 degrees (fully straight)

**How ROM Measured:**
- Goniometer (protractor-like device)
- Measured by physician, PA, or physical therapist
- Active ROM (you move it) most important
- Passive ROM (examiner moves it) also documented

**Pain on Motion:**
- Pain during ROM testing limits functional ROM
- Can support higher rating even if ROM not severely limited

**Repeated Motion:**
- ROM may decrease with repeated use
- VA should consider functional ROM after repeated use

**Flare-Ups:**
- ROM during flare-ups (worse periods) should be considered

### 3. Functional Impact Documentation

**Employment:**
- Job requirements (standing, walking, stairs, kneeling)
- Work limitations due to knee
- Reduced hours or job loss
- Accommodations needed

**Daily Life:**
- Difficulty with stairs
- Walking limitations (distance, terrain)
- Need for assistive devices (cane, brace, walker)
- Sports/activities given up
- Household chores affected

**Pain and Swelling:**
- Frequency and severity
- What triggers pain
- Swelling after activity
- Medication use

### 4. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Service medical records documenting knee injury
- Injury during training, combat, sports
- Continuity of symptoms from service to present

**Secondary Service Connection:**
Common primary conditions causing secondary knee problems:
- **Knee injury causing arthritis:** Original injury service-connected, arthritis develops later
- **Foot/ankle condition causing knee problems:** Altered gait
- **Hip condition affecting knee:** Biomechanical compensation
- **Obesity secondary to service-connected condition:** Increased knee stress
- **Back condition:** Altered posture/gait affecting knees

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing knee condition worsened by service
- Evidence of baseline condition and worsening

### 5. Nexus Opinion

Medical opinion linking knee condition to service or service-connected condition.

**Strong Nexus Includes:**
- Review of service records showing injury/overuse
- Review of imaging and current condition
- Medical explanation of connection
- "At least as likely as not" statement
- Timeline supporting connection

**Example Nexus:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's bilateral knee osteoarthritis is related to military service. Service records document the veteran served as an infantryman with frequent marching under heavy loads, airborne operations, and a documented left knee injury. Such activities are well-established risk factors for premature knee arthritis. Current X-rays show moderate osteoarthritis consistent with post-traumatic and overuse etiology. The temporal relationship supports service connection."

- Report pain during ROM testing
- Mention if knee is having a good or bad day
- Demonstrate instability if present ("giving way")
- Explain functional limitations clearly
- Mention all symptoms (pain, swelling, stiffness, instability)

**DON'T:**
- Try to "tough it out" and push through pain
- Exaggerate ROM limitations (examiner can usually tell)
- Forget to mention all your symptoms
- Minimize functional impact
- Forget to discuss both knees if both affected

**Critical Information to Provide:**

1. **History:** When knee problems started, connection to service
2. **Pain:** Location, severity (1-10), frequency, what triggers it
3. **Instability:** Does knee "give way," how often
4. **Locking/Catching:** If meniscus damage
5. **Swelling:** Frequency, after what activities

**Range of Motion Testing:**
- Examiner will bend your knee (flexion) and measure angle
- Examiner will check if you can fully straighten (extension)
- Report pain during movement
- If you cannot complete full ROM due to pain, that's important
- If ROM worsens with repeated use, mention it

## Claim Strategy

### Initial Claim Strategy

**Step 1: Get Comprehensive Evaluation**
- Orthopedic examination
- Recent imaging (X-ray minimum, MRI if soft tissue injury suspected)
- Range of motion measurements
- Document all symptoms

**Step 2: Determine Service Connection Path**
- **Direct:** Knee injury during service
- **Secondary:** Knee problem from another service-connected condition
- **Aggravation:** Pre-existing condition worsened by service

**Step 3: Gather Service Evidence**
- Service medical records documenting knee injury/treatment
- If no service records, focus on circumstantial evidence:
  - MOS involving knee stress (infantry, airborne, etc.)
  - Training injuries common in your branch/MOS
  - Buddy statements about injury

**Step 4: Obtain Nexus**
- Orthopedist, primary care, or sports medicine doctor
- Provide them with service records and imaging
- Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) if needed

**Step 5: File Comprehensively**
Submit:
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Medical records with diagnosis
- Imaging reports
- Service records documenting injury
- Nexus letter
- Personal statement with functional impact
- Lay statements
- Employment records if relevant

### Bilateral Claims (Both Knees)

**If both knees are affected, file for both.**

**Bilateral Factor:**
- VA adds 10% of combined rating for bilateral conditions
- Example:
  - Right knee: 20%
  - Left knee: 20%
  - Combined: 36% (32% + 10% bilateral factor)
  - Paid at 40%: $755.28/month

**Strategy:**
- Document both knees thoroughly
- Get ROM measurements for both
- Imaging for both
- Functional impact of having both knees affected

### Secondary Claim Strategy

**Knee Arthritis Secondary to Service-Connected Knee Injury:**

Very common progression.

**Evidence:**
1. Service-connected knee injury (often rated low initially)
2. X-rays showing arthritis development
3. Nexus: Arthritis is natural consequence of knee injury
4. Worsening symptoms over time

**Example:**
- 1990: Knee injury during service
- 1995: Granted 10% for knee instability
- 2015: X-rays show moderate arthritis
- 2015: File for increase based on arthritis progression
- Result: Increased to 20-30%

**Knee Problems Secondary to Other Conditions:**
- Foot/ankle condition → altered gait → knee stress → knee arthritis
- Hip condition → biomechanical changes → knee stress
- Obesity (if secondary to service-connected condition) → knee stress

### Increase Rating Strategy

**When to File for Increase:**
- ROM has decreased
- Pain has worsened
- Instability has increased
- New arthritis or worsening arthritis on X-ray
- Knee surgery (even if "successful")
- Functional impairment increased

**Evidence for Increase:**
- New ROM measurements showing worse limitation
- Updated imaging showing progression
- Surgical records (if surgery performed)
- Increased medications
- New assistive devices (brace, cane)
- Work impact increased
- Updated personal and lay statements

**Post-Surgery Increase:**
- Many veterans file for increase after knee surgery
- Even "successful" surgery often leaves residuals
- Document post-op ROM, pain, instability
- Wait until final outcome clear (usually 1 year post-op)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability if I had knee surgery?
Yes. Knee surgery (meniscectomy, ACL reconstruction, total knee replacement) is often service-connected if the underlying condition is service-connected. Rating is based on residual symptoms and limitations after surgery.

### What if my knee is better some days than others?
Rating should reflect your condition during flare-ups, not just your best days. Document the variability and functional impact on bad days.

### Do I need ROM measurements to get a rating?
Yes, ROM measurements are critical for knee ratings under DC 5257. The C&P examiner will measure your ROM.

### Can I get rated for knee pain without ROM limitations?
Difficult. Knee ratings are primarily ROM-based. However, if you have instability, locking, or other functional impairment, you may qualify even with good ROM.

### What if I have arthritis in my knee from a service-connected injury?
File for an increase. Arthritis that develops from a service-connected knee injury is part of the natural progression and should be rated accordingly. Get new X-rays and file for increase.

### Can knee problems be secondary to back or hip conditions?
Yes. Biomechanical changes from back or hip problems can cause knee stress and arthritis. Get medical nexus explaining the connection.

### What rating do I get for total knee replacement?
Minimum 30% under DC 5261. Can be higher based on residual symptoms and ROM limitations. Often 30-60% depending on outcome.

### Will my knee rating be reduced if I get surgery?
Not automatically, and often surgery reveals worse damage, leading to higher ratings. Don't avoid needed surgery for fear of rating reduction.

### Can I get separate ratings for multiple knee conditions?
Generally no. The knee is rated as a whole under the condition producing the greatest limitation. However, if you have separate, distinct conditions affecting different aspects, pyramiding rules apply.

### What if I have arthritis in both knees?
File for both. Each knee is rated separately, then combined with a bilateral factor, often resulting in a higher combined rating.

### How important is my job for the rating?
Functional impact matters. If your job requires standing/walking and your knee prevents this, document it. However, rating is primarily based on ROM and instability, not job-specific factors.

### Can I get TDIU for knee conditions?
Possibly. If knee problems (combined with other conditions) prevent substantially gainful employment, you may qualify for TDIU. Requires one condition at 60% or combined 70% with one at 40%.

## Final Thoughts

Knee conditions are among the most common musculoskeletal disabilities affecting veterans. Repetitive stress, heavy load carrying, airborne operations, combat injuries, and training accidents all take a toll on knees.

**Keys to a Successful Knee Claim:**

1. **Get comprehensive evaluation** - Imaging, ROM, orthopedic exam
2. **Document functional impact** - Specific examples of limitations
3. **Establish service connection** - Injury during service or secondary to another condition
4. **File for both knees** - If both affected, bilateral claims rate higher
5. **Consider secondary conditions** - Arthritis developing from old injury
6. **Don't delay** - File when you have evidence, can always file for increase later
7. **Update as condition worsens** - Arthritis and old injuries progress over time

Knee problems significantly impact quality of life and ability to work. If your knee condition is related to your military service, you deserve compensation.

**File your claim. Protect your knees. Get the benefits you earned.**
