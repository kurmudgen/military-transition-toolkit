[INTRO]

**The Truth About Tech:**

Non-technical veterans succeed in tech regularly. Real example - 31B Military Police, zero tech experience, started IT career after service. Said military experience mattered more than college degree. Why? Tech companies value what you have - leadership, problem-solving under pressure, teamwork, mission focus, adaptability. You learn fast under stress. That's rare.

**Entry Paths Without Coding:**

You don't need to become a software developer. Multiple entry points:

**Technical Product Manager:** Bridge between engineering and business. Define what product should do, work with engineers to build it. $158K average. Entry level Associate Product Manager $86K. Your leadership and planning skills transfer. Understanding user needs, prioritizing requirements, managing timelines - you did this in military.

**Technical Project Manager:** Manage software projects, coordinate teams, track deliverables. $115K-$139K. Your project management from military directly applies. PMI-ACP (Agile) certification helps - $435, study online.

**Technical Sales/Solutions Engineer:** Sell tech products/services. $75K-$150K+ (base plus commission). Your communication skills, presentation ability, understanding customer needs. Tech companies need people who can talk to non-technical customers. They'll train you on product.

**Customer Success Manager:** Ensure customers successfully use software after purchase. $70K-$95K. Relationship management, problem-solving, training customers. Your service mentality and patience valuable.

**IT Operations/DevOps:** Keep systems running, manage deployments, monitor performance. $75K-$110K. Your troubleshooting, process adherence, working under pressure. Can start help desk $45K-$55K, move up quickly.

**Program Manager:** Oversee multiple projects, coordinate across teams. $95K-$130K. Your experience managing complex operations with multiple stakeholders translates perfectly.

**The Coding Path (If You Want It):**

**VET TEC Program:** Reauthorized December 2024 (Dole Act). Free tech training - coding bootcamps, cybersecurity, IT - without using GI Bill. Zero cost. Programs 12-26 weeks. Data shows 85% job placement within 6 months. Average salary jump $38K to $76.5K - 102% increase. Better outcomes than non-veterans.

**Outcomes:** Software developers $130K median. Cybersecurity analysts $85K entry, senior $120K+. Job growth - cybersecurity up 33%, software development up 18% through 2033. 514,000 cybersecurity openings currently.

**Bootcamp Options:** Code Platoon (veteran-focused), Microsoft 17-week program (free, includes interview opportunities), Fullstack Academy, Nucamp. VET TEC covers tuition. Focus on JavaScript, Python, or cybersecurity depending on interest.

**Skills That Transfer:**

Leadership - you led fire teams/squads/sections under pressure. Tech needs leaders who remain calm when systems fail.

Problem-solving - you troubleshot equipment, figured out solutions with limited resources. Same skill debugging code or system issues.

Process adherence - you followed SOPs, understood why procedures exist. Tech needs this for security, compliance, quality.

Mission focus - you completed objectives despite obstacles. Tech projects have deliverables and deadlines.

Teamwork - you worked with diverse personalities toward common goal. Software development is team sport.

Learning agility - you mastered new skills quickly in military. Tech changes constantly - fast learners thrive.

**Reality Check:**

Tech isn't magic. It's problem-solving with computers. Companies care about results, not pedigree. No tech experience? Irrelevant if you demonstrate capability to learn and deliver. Your military background proves both.

Imposter syndrome real - everyone feels unqualified initially. Veterans actually have advantage - you're comfortable being uncomfortable, asking questions, admitting what you don't know to learn faster.

**Starting Strategy:**

**Option 1 - Non-coding entry (fastest):** Target technical project manager, product manager, or technical sales roles. Highlight leadership, project management, stakeholder coordination from military. Get PMP or PMI-ACP certification ($435-$555). Apply to tech companies with military hiring programs (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Salesforce). Leverage SkillBridge for internships. Timeline: 3-6 months.

**Option 2 - Coding bootcamp:** Apply to VET TEC (no GI Bill cost). Choose bootcamp - Code Platoon if available (veteran-specific), otherwise Fullstack Academy or Nucamp. 12-26 week program. Build portfolio projects. Apply for junior developer roles. Timeline: 6-12 months including bootcamp.

**Option 3 - Start IT, level up:** Get CompTIA A+ certification ($246), start help desk role $45K-$55K. Learn on job, pursue additional certs (Network+, Security+, cloud certs). Move into specialized roles. Timeline: immediate start, 1-2 years to $75K+ role.

**Companies Hiring Veterans in Tech:**

Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Salesforce - all have military recruiting programs. Microsoft MSSA program specifically for transitioning service members. Amazon Military Apprenticeship. Hire Heroes USA and American Corporate Partners connect veterans with tech companies.

**Resources Available:**

VET TEC for free training. GI Bill for bootcamps or degree if you prefer. SkillBridge for internships last 180 days. Coding bootcamps report 85%+ veteran job placement. LinkedIn veterans program connects you with recruiters.

**Timeline:** 12mo out research which tech path interests you (coding vs non-coding), 6-9mo complete training/certifications, 3-6mo apply positions emphasizing military leadership and problem-solving skills, separation transition into tech role.

**The Bottom Line:**

Non-technical MOS not a barrier. Your military skills valuable in tech. Multiple entry paths - choose based on interests and timeline. VET TEC removes financial barrier if you want coding. Companies actively recruiting veterans. The question isn't whether you can break into tech - it's which path you'll choose.
