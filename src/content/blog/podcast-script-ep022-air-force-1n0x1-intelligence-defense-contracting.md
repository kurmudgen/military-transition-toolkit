[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** 1N0 - all-source intelligence analyst. Collection, analysis, production, briefings. Defense contractors need you - analyst at ninety thousand, senior at one hundred twenty thousand, with TS/SCI one hundred forty thousand plus. Path similar to Army 35F (Episode 11).

**Your 1N0 Skills:** Multi-source intelligence analysis (SIGINT, HUMINT, IMINT, OSINT), intelligence databases, production, briefing senior leaders, targeting support. Professional intelligence work.

**Career Paths:**

**Defense Contractor Intelligence Analyst:** Supporting DOD/IC missions as contractor. $85K-$140K+ with TS/SCI. Familiar work, higher pay, often same location.

**All-Source Analyst:** Continuing same work civilian side. $90K-$130K. TS/SCI clearance critical - adds $20K-$40K premium.

**Targeting Analyst:** ISR targeting support. $95K-$135K. Combat experience enhances value.

**Geospatial Intelligence Analyst:** If GEOINT experience. $85K-$125K. Specialized skillset.

**Threat Intelligence Analyst:** Corporate cyber threat intelligence. $85K-$130K. Translates military intel to business.

**Data/Business Intelligence Analyst:** Corporate analytics (see Episode 11). $75K-$110K. Less clearance premium but broader opportunities.

**Companies:** Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI, Leidos, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, SAIC, General Dynamics, Raytheon Intelligence & Space, L3Harris, ManTech. All major defense contractors have intelligence contracts.

**Clearance Critical:** TS/SCI clearance worth $20K-$40K salary premium. Keep active by working cleared positions. Clearance processing 12-18 months for civilians - you already have it, that's your edge.

**Certifications:** CDASA (Certified Defense All-Source Analyst) required/preferred many contracts. Levels 1-3 based on experience. Some contracts require specific IC certifications.

**AF Intelligence Advantage:** AF intelligence training comprehensive. Access to advanced systems/training. Your clearance and technical skills combination powerful.

**Path Options:**
- **Stay Defense:** Contractor work 5-10 years, $100K-$150K, stable, familiar.
- **Go Corporate:** Tech/finance threat intelligence, $85K-$130K, more variety, lose clearance premium.
- **Pursue Advanced:** Data science path (add Python/ML), $110K-$150K+, requires additional technical learning.

**Timeline:** 12mo network with contractors (LinkedIn, job fairs), 6-9mo apply positions (emphasize clearance and skills), 3-6mo interview/offers, separation transition smoothly (often same work location).

**Transition Easy:** Many 1N0s work alongside contractors already. Know the work, know the companies. Just transitioning from uniform to civilian clothes doing same mission.
