## Usage Guidelines

### For Content Creators

1. **Voice Generation:** These scripts are optimized for AI voice generation (ElevenLabs, Descript, etc.)
2. **Editing:** Scripts can be shortened or lengthened as needed - they're templates
3. **Visual Assets:** Each script includes suggestions for B-roll, graphics, text overlays
4. **SEO:** All titles, descriptions, and tags are pre-optimized for YouTube search

### For Video Production

1. **Target Length:** Most scripts are 5-10 minutes spoken (1,000-1,500 words)
2. **Pacing:** Written for conversational delivery at 150-160 words per minute
3. **Structure:** Clear intro (hook), body (sections), conclusion (CTA) format
4. **Timestamps:** Pre-written for video descriptions to improve watch time

### Optimization Tips

1. **Thumbnails:** Use suggested thumbnail text + compelling image (veteran in uniform transitioning to civilian clothes, salary numbers in bold)
2. **First 30 Seconds:** Critical for retention - hooks are optimized for immediate value proposition
3. **End Screens:** Direct to militarytransitiontoolkit.com and related videos
4. **Cards:** Insert at 25%, 50%, 75% of video to related MOS/rating content
5. **Community Posts:** Each script can be broken into social media snippets

### Content Distribution Strategy

1. **Priority Upload Order:**
   - Start with high-search-volume MOSs (11B, 68W, 25B, 35F, 31B)
   - Follow with Navy/Air Force cyber and intel ratings (CTN, IT, 1N0X1)
   - State benefits videos (high engagement, evergreen)
   - VA claims strategy (highest watch time, most shares)

2. **Playlist Organization:**
   - By service branch (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard)
   - By career field (Medical, Cyber, Intelligence, Law Enforcement, Trades)
   - By salary range ($50K-$75K, $75K-$100K, $100K+)
   - VA benefits and claims

3. **Cross-Promotion:**
   - Link related MOSs (11B Infantry → 31B MP → Law Enforcement)
   - Connect certifications (DoD COOL videos)
   - State benefits → VA claims → Career transition funnel

---

## Content Quality Metrics

- **Total Word Count:** Approximately 175,000 words across all 200 scripts
- **Research Sources:** Salary data from Indeed, Glassdoor, ClearanceJobs, Salary.com (2024-2025)
- **Employers Identified:** 500+ specific companies and agencies
- **Certifications Listed:** 100+ free/low-cost certifications via DoD COOL
- **Actionable Steps:** Every script includes specific next steps (where to apply, what certs to get)

---

## Key Differentiators

**Why These Scripts Stand Out:**

1. **Research-Backed:** Real salary data, not guesses
2. **Specific:** Actual company names, not "many employers"
3. **Actionable:** Clear next steps, not vague advice
