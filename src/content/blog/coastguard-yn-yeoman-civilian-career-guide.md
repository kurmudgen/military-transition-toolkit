Coast Guard Yeomen have **human resources, administrative, and personnel management skills** that translate directly to civilian HR specialist, payroll administrator, office manager, and administrative coordinator roles. Your experience managing personnel records, processing pay and benefits, advising on career matters, and handling sensitive HR functions makes you a strong candidate. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$65,000** for entry-level admin and HR roles, with experienced HR specialists hitting **$70,000-$95,000+** and senior HR managers reaching **$95,000-$130,000+**.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every Coast Guard YN wonders: "Do my personnel admin skills translate to civilian HR jobs?"

Here's the truth: **Yes—civilian HR is exactly what you've been doing.**

What you did in the Coast Guard:
- Managed personnel service records and documentation
- Processed pay, allowances, travel claims, and benefits
- Counseled service members on career options, transfers, retirement
- Handled confidential personnel matters
- Maintained personnel accounting and administrative records
- Managed office operations and correspondence
- Used personnel management systems
- Completed 8-week YN "A" School (HR management, records, payroll, personnel transfers)

That's **exactly** what civilian HR specialists, payroll administrators, and office managers do.

The gap? Civilian employers want **HR certifications** (SHRM-CP, PHR) and experience with civilian HR software (Workday, ADP, BambooHR). Your YN experience proves competency. Certifications prove it professionally.
