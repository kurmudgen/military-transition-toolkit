# VA Nexus Letters: What They Are, When You Need One, and How to Get One (2025)

Here's something that'll save you months of frustration: most VA disability claim denials aren't because you don't have a legitimate service-connected condition. They're denied because you're missing a nexus letter.

That single piece of paper—typically costing anywhere from $400 to $2,000—is often the difference between a denial and a service-connected rating. Let's break down exactly what nexus letters are, when you actually need one, and how to get a good one without getting ripped off.

## What Is a Nexus Letter?

A nexus letter is a medical opinion from a qualified healthcare provider that establishes a connection (the "nexus") between your current medical condition and your military service.

The VA needs three things to grant service connection:
1. **A current diagnosed condition** (your medical records)
2. **An in-service event, injury, or illness** (your service records)
3. **A link between the two** (this is your nexus letter)

You might have rock-solid proof of #1 and #2, but without #3, the VA will deny your claim. Every single time.

Here's what a nexus opinion looks like in plain English: "In my professional medical opinion, it is at least as likely as not that the veteran's current knee osteoarthritis is related to the documented knee injury during airborne training in 2012."

That phrase—"at least as likely as not"—is critical. It means there's a 50% or greater probability. That's the legal standard the VA uses for service connection.

## When Do You Need a Nexus Letter?

Not every VA claim needs a nexus letter. If you filed for a knee injury within a year of leaving service and your service medical records clearly document the injury, the VA can usually connect the dots themselves.

But you definitely need one when:

### 1. You're Filing Years After Service

Filed for PTSD 5 years after separating? The VA will want to know why it's connected to service when you didn't mention it before. A nexus letter explains that PTSD symptoms often emerge or worsen years after trauma exposure.

This is super common. Most people don't realize their issues are service-connected until years later.

### 2. Your Service Records Are Incomplete

Didn't go to sick call for that back injury because your unit was deploying and you didn't want to get left behind? Yeah, you're not alone. But now you need a medical professional to review your service history and provide an opinion that the injury likely occurred during service.

### 3. You're Filing for a Secondary Condition

This is huge. If your service-connected knee injury caused you to develop hip arthritis from walking with a limp for 10 years, that hip condition can be service-connected as secondary to your knee. But you need a nexus letter explaining the chain of causation.

Secondary conditions are how most people increase their ratings from 50% to 70% or 70% to 100%. Don't skip this.

### 4. Your Condition Has an Unclear Cause

Conditions like tinnitus, migraines, or certain cancers can have multiple potential causes. A nexus letter explains why military service is at least as likely as any other cause.

### 5. You're Increasing an Existing Rating

If your service-connected PTSD has gotten worse and you think you now warrant a 70% rating instead of 50%, you might need an updated psychological evaluation with a nexus opinion about worsening symptoms.

## What Makes a Valid Nexus Letter?

Here's where veterans get burned. Not all nexus letters are created equal, and the VA can (and will) reject poorly written ones.

A valid nexus letter must include:

### The Doctor's Credentials

The provider must be qualified to diagnose and treat your specific condition. For PTSD, that means a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist—not your primary care doc. For orthopedic issues, an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine physician carries way more weight than a general practitioner.

### Review of Records

The letter must show that the doctor reviewed your:
- Complete service medical records
- Current medical records
- Service treatment records (STRs)
- VA treatment records if applicable
- Any relevant civilian medical records

If the letter doesn't explicitly state what records were reviewed, the VA can reject it. And they will.

### Clear Nexus Opinion

The letter must include language like:
- "It is at least as likely as not..." (50%+ probability)
- "It is more likely than not..." (51%+ probability, even stronger)
- "It is as likely as not..." (also acceptable)

Avoid letters that say:
- "It is possible..." (not strong enough)
- "It could be related..." (wishy-washy)
- "May be connected..." (the VA will deny this immediately)

### Medical Rationale

This is the meat of the letter. The doctor must explain WHY they believe the connection exists, using medical science and evidence. "Based on the veteran's description" isn't enough—they need to cite medical literature, explain mechanisms of injury, or reference medical principles.

### Specific Details

Generic form letters don't work. The letter should reference:
- Your specific service dates and MOS
- Particular incidents from your service records
- Your current symptoms in detail
- How your service caused or aggravated the condition

## Sample Nexus Letter Language

Here's an example of what strong nexus language looks like for a knee condition:

> "I am a board-certified orthopedic surgeon with 15 years of experience treating military veterans. I have reviewed SSgt Johnson's complete service medical records from 2010-2016, his VA medical records from 2017-present, and conducted a comprehensive orthopedic examination on [date].
>
> SSgt Johnson's service medical records document a parachute landing injury in March 2013 during airborne training at Fort Bragg, resulting in a right knee sprain. He continued to experience intermittent knee pain throughout his service, documented in sick call records from 2013-2016.
>
> My current examination reveals moderate osteoarthritis of the right knee, confirmed by MRI showing joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation consistent with post-traumatic arthritis.
>
> Based on my review of the medical evidence and my examination, it is my opinion that SSgt Johnson's current right knee osteoarthritis is at least as likely as not (probability of 50% or greater) caused by his service-connected knee injury in 2013. Post-traumatic arthritis is a well-documented sequela of significant joint trauma, particularly in weight-bearing joints. The timeline and mechanism of injury support this conclusion.
>
> This opinion is based on review of the complete medical record, current medical literature on post-traumatic arthritis, and my clinical expertise in treating similar conditions."

See how specific that is? That's what gets approved.

## Where to Get a Nexus Letter

You've got several options, and prices vary wildly:

### 1. Your Current Doctor ($0-$500)

If you have an established relationship with a specialist who treats your condition, ask them to write a nexus letter. Some will do it as part of your regular care. Others charge a document fee ($100-$500). This is often your best option if the doctor knows your case well.

**Pros:** Cheap, established relationship, knows your medical history  
**Cons:** Many civilian doctors aren't familiar with VA standards and write letters that get rejected

### 2. VA Compensation & Pension (C&P) Exam ($0)

When you file a claim, the VA schedules a C&P exam. The examiner is supposed to provide a nexus opinion. But here's the problem: C&P examiners are often overworked contractors who spend 15 minutes with you and provide weak opinions. About 50% of initial claims get denied even with a C&P exam.

**Pros:** Free, part of the process  
**Cons:** Rushed exams, examiner may not be familiar with your service history, often results in denials

Full disclosure: don't count on the C&P exam alone if your claim is complicated.

### 3. Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) Services ($1,500-$2,500)

Companies like Medical Opinion Plus, Nexus Letter, and others specialize in writing nexus letters for veterans. You pay a flat fee, submit your records, and they assign a qualified doctor to review your case and write a comprehensive letter.

**Pros:** Doctors understand VA standards, high success rates, comprehensive reviews  
**Cons:** Expensive, no in-person exam (usually record review only)

### 4. VSO-Affiliated Medical Examiners ($500-$1,500)

Some Veterans Service Organizations have relationships with doctors who write nexus letters at reduced rates for VSO clients.

**Pros:** Lower cost than full IMO services, VSO familiar with case  
**Cons:** May have long wait times, limited availability

## Red Flags: Avoid These Nexus Letter Scams

The VA disability claims industry has its share of scammers. Watch out for:

### 🚩 "Guaranteed Approval" Claims

No legitimate medical provider can guarantee the VA will approve your claim. Anyone promising guaranteed results is lying. Run away.

### 🚩 Form Letters

If every nexus letter from a provider looks identical except for the name and condition, the VA will reject it. You need a letter specific to YOUR service records and medical history.

### 🚩 Unqualified Providers

A general practitioner writing a nexus letter for a complex psychiatric condition won't hold weight. Make sure the provider is qualified for your specific condition.

### 🚩 Upfront Payment for "Approval"

Legitimate services charge for the letter, not for claim approval. Anyone asking for a percentage of your back pay is running a scam.

### 🚩 No Record Review

If a doctor offers to write a nexus letter without reviewing your service records and medical records, run away. That letter will be worthless.

### 🚩 Rock-Bottom Prices

If someone offers a nexus letter for $99, there's no way a qualified doctor spent adequate time reviewing your case. You get what you pay for.

## DIY Nexus Letter vs. Professional: What's Right for You?

### Go DIY (Ask Your Doctor) If:

- You have a straightforward, well-documented injury
- Your doctor knows your history and is willing to learn VA standards
- You're filing within 1-2 years of service
- Your service records clearly document the injury or condition
- You're on a tight budget

Send your doctor:
- The VA's [Adequate Medical Evidence fact sheet](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_publicdbqs.asp)
- A timeline of your service-connected events
- Sample nexus letter language
- Your complete service medical records

### Go Professional If:

- Your claim was already denied once
- Your service records are incomplete or missing
- You're filing years after service
- Your condition has a complex or unclear cause
- You're filing for a secondary condition
- You can afford the investment ($1,500-$2,500)

The success rate for claims with professional nexus letters is significantly higher than DIY attempts. If you're looking at the difference between a $0/month denial and $1,500-$3,000/month tax-free for the rest of your life, spending $2,000 on a solid nexus letter is a no-brainer.

## How to Maximize Your Nexus Letter's Effectiveness

Once you have your nexus letter, don't just upload it to VA.gov and pray.

### 1. Submit It at Initial Filing

Don't wait for a denial. If you know your claim needs a nexus letter, get one upfront. This cuts months off your timeline.

### 2. Reference It in Your Personal Statement

Your personal statement should walk the rater through your evidence, including: "See attached nexus letter from Dr. Smith, board-certified orthopedic surgeon, dated [date], establishing service connection for my knee osteoarthritis."

### 3. Highlight Key Passages

In your claim, reference specific page numbers and key findings from the nexus letter. Make the rater's job easier.

### 4. Include Supporting Evidence

Don't rely solely on the nexus letter. Include buddy statements, service photos, deployment records, and anything else that corroborates your case.

### 5. Get Multiple Opinions for Complex Claims

For really complicated cases (multiple secondary conditions, rare diseases, etc.), consider getting nexus letters from multiple specialists. An additional opinion strengthens your case.

## Common Nexus Letter Mistakes That Lead to Denials

Even with a nexus letter, you can still get denied if:

### The Doctor Uses Weak Language

"Possibly related" or "could be connected" isn't strong enough. It must be "at least as likely as not."

### No Rationale Provided

"In my opinion, the veteran's condition is service-connected" without explanation will be rejected. The VA needs to know WHY the doctor reached that conclusion.

### Doctor Didn't Review Service Records

If the letter doesn't explicitly state that service records were reviewed, the VA assumes they weren't and gives the opinion little weight.

### Qualification Issues

A general practitioner opining on complex psychiatric issues won't carry much weight. You need a specialist.

### The Timeline Doesn't Make Sense

If your doctor says your 2020 injury is connected to a 2015 service incident, but your medical records show the injury started in 2018, the nexus falls apart. Make sure the timeline is bulletproof.

## Financial Impact: Why a Nexus Letter Is Worth It

Let's talk numbers. Say you're a veteran with PTSD that you know is service-connected, but your claim keeps getting denied because you didn't seek treatment until 3 years after separation.

Without a nexus letter explaining delayed symptom onset: **$0/month, denied claim**

With a solid nexus letter from a psychologist: **70% PTSD rating = $1,716.28/month ($20,595.36/year), tax-free, for life**

If you spend $2,000 on a professional nexus letter and it results in approval, you've recouped that cost in 35 days. Every month after that is pure benefit.

Now factor in back pay. If your claim takes 6 months to process, you get 6 months of retroactive pay: **$10,297.68**. The nexus letter essentially paid for itself 5 times over, plus you have a lifetime of benefits.

Do the math on that. It's not even close.

## The Bottom Line

Nexus letters aren't optional for most VA claims—they're essential. Most denials happen because the VA can't connect your current condition to your service, even when both are well-documented.

Here's your action plan:

1. **Evaluate your claim**: Does it need a nexus letter? (If you're filing more than a year after service, for secondary conditions, or with incomplete records, yes.)

2. **Decide DIY vs. professional**: Can your current doctor write an adequate letter, or do you need a professional IMO service?

3. **Vet the provider**: Check credentials, read reviews, avoid scams and guarantees.

4. **Ensure completeness**: The letter must include credentials, record review, clear nexus opinion, medical rationale, and specific details.

5. **Submit strategically**: Don't wait for a denial—include the nexus letter with your initial claim.

6. **Use our VA claims tools**: Track your claim, estimate your rating, and connect with verified VSOs at [Military Transition Toolkit](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com).

A good nexus letter is the single most powerful piece of evidence you can submit. Don't let a preventable denial cost you thousands in monthly benefits. Get it right the first time.
