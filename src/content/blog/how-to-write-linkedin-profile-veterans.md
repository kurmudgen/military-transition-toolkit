# How to Write a LinkedIn Profile That Gets Hired: Complete Veteran Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

A strong LinkedIn profile increases your chance of being contacted by recruiters by 70%. Most veteran LinkedIn profiles either emphasize military jargon or bury civilian-relevant accomplishments. This guide walks you through creating a LinkedIn profile optimized for recruiter searches, employer vetting, and networking that positions you as a civilian professional in your target industry.

## Why LinkedIn Matters for Veterans

**Statistics That Prove LinkedIn's Value:**
- 70% of recruiters use LinkedIn exclusively to find candidates
- 95% of job seekers check your LinkedIn before interviewing you
- Profiles with photos get 21x more profile views
- Profiles with skills get 5x more recruiter messages
- Profiles with headlines get 2x more recruiter messages

For veterans, LinkedIn is your online resume and networking platform combined. Recruiters use it to find you. Hiring managers use it to vet you before interviews. Colleagues use it to connect with you. Your LinkedIn profile is often your first impression.

## LinkedIn Profile Structure

### 1. Profile Photo (Critical)

**Requirements:**
- Professional headshot
- Solid background (white, gray, or professional setting)
- Face fills 60% of frame
- Smiling, direct eye contact
- Business attire appropriate to your industry
- Recent (within last year)

**Why This Matters:**
- Profiles with photos get 21x more views
- Photo is first thing recruiters see
- Impacts whether profile gets fully read

**Avoid:**
- Military uniform photos (unless applying to defense contractor)
- Casual/party photos
- Photos with other people
- Low-quality selfies

### 2. Headline (Most Important Text)

Your headline appears in search results and is one of the first things recruiters see.

**For Active Job Seekers:**
```
[Specific Job Title] | [Key Skill] | Open to [Position Type] | [Location]
```

**Examples:**

**Weak Headlines:**
- "Military Officer"
- "Veteran seeking employment"
- "Operations Leader"

**Strong Headlines:**
- "Supply Chain Manager | Operations Optimization | Open to Logistics Roles | Atlanta, GA"
- "Project Manager | Process Improvement | Seeking PM/Operations Roles | Remote"
- "IT Professional | Systems Administrator | Cloud Infrastructure | Open to Cloud Engineer roles"
- "Training Manager | L&D Specialist | Leadership Development | Boston, MA Area"

**Why This Works:**
- Specific job titles (not "military officer")
- Key skills employers search for
- Location (or "Remote" if willing)
- "Open to [roles]" signals job seeking

A: Yes, if you have an active clearance. It's highly valuable and searchable by recruiters.
