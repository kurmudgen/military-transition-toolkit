**Evidence Needed:**
- Medical diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2)
- Treatment records (medications, insulin, monitoring)
- HbA1c lab results over time
- Documentation of regulation required
- Evidence of complications (if any)
- Nexus linking diabetes to service or service-connected condition

## Understanding Diabetes VA Ratings

Diabetes Mellitus is rated under 38 CFR § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913. Ratings are based on the level of regulation and treatment required, not on how well-controlled the diabetes is.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** Requiring oral medication for control.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Type 2 diabetes controlled with oral medications
- Metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, etc.
- May check blood sugar occasionally
- Diet and exercise modifications
- No insulin required
- Generally well-controlled

**Monthly:** $171.23

**Common Rating** for Type 2 diabetes managed with pills.

#### 20% Rating
**Criteria:** Requiring insulin for control.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Type 1 diabetes (always requires insulin)
- Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin
- Daily insulin injections or insulin pump
- Regular blood sugar monitoring (multiple times daily)
- Carbohydrate counting
- Risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- More intensive management required

**Monthly:** $333.01

**Minimum Rating** for any veteran using insulin.

**Most Common Rating** for Type 1 diabetes or insulin-requiring Type 2.

#### 40% Rating
**Criteria:** Requiring insulin AND restricted diet (carbohydrate counting/exchange system) AND regulation of activities.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Insulin-dependent diabetes
- Must follow structured meal plan with carb counting
- Must regulate activities (exercise timing, intensity) to manage blood sugar
- More difficult-to-control diabetes
- Frequent blood sugar fluctuations
- Lifestyle significantly impacted by diabetes management

**Monthly:** $755.28

**Important:** Must have ALL THREE:
1. Insulin
2. Restricted diet (carb counting/exchange system)
3. Regulation of activities

#### 60% Rating
**Criteria:** Requiring insulin, restricted diet, AND regulation of activities, with ONE OR MORE episodes within the last year of **ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring hospitalization**.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Unstable diabetes with serious complications
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring hospitalization
- Severe hypoglycemia requiring ER/hospital admission
- Blood sugar very difficult to control
- Frequent dangerous fluctuations
- Significant health risk

**Monthly:** $1,361.88

**Requirements:**
- All requirements of 40% rating, PLUS
- 1+ hospitalizations for DKA or severe hypoglycemia in past year

#### 100% Rating
**Criteria:** Requiring insulin, restricted diet, AND regulation of activities, with TWO OR MORE episodes within the last year of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring hospitalization.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Brittle, uncontrolled diabetes
- Frequent life-threatening episodes
- Multiple hospitalizations
- Cannot safely function due to diabetes instability
- Major health crisis

**Monthly:** $3,831.30

**Very Rare** - requires 2+ hospitalizations for DKA or severe hypoglycemia in one year.

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Medical Diagnosis

**Required:**
- Medical records documenting diabetes diagnosis
- Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes
- Laboratory confirmation (typically fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5%)

**Diagnosis Criteria:**
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL
- HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
- Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms
- Oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL at 2 hours

### 2. Treatment Documentation

**Critical for Rating:**
Document your treatment regimen in detail:

**Medications:**
- **Oral medications:** List all (metformin, glyburide, glipizide, sitagliptin, empagliflozin, etc.)
- **Injectable non-insulin medications:** GLP-1 agonists (Ozempic, Trulicity, Victoza, etc.) - Note: These are NOT insulin
- **Insulin:** Type (rapid, short, intermediate, long-acting), dosage, frequency

**Blood Sugar Monitoring:**
- How often you check (fasting, before meals, bedtime, middle of night)
- Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) if used
- Log of blood sugar readings

**Diet:**
- Carbohydrate counting
- Exchange system
- Meal planning
- Dietary restrictions

**Activity Regulation:**
- How diabetes affects exercise timing
- Activity limitations
- Need to adjust insulin/food for activities

### 3. Evidence for Higher Ratings

**For 40% Rating:**
Document ALL THREE:
1. **Insulin use:** Prescription records, insulin type and dosage
2. **Restricted diet:** Carb counting records, meal plans, dietitian appointments
3. **Regulation of activities:** How you must plan activities around blood sugar, adjust insulin for exercise, limitations

**For 60% Rating:**
Document:
- All requirements of 40%, PLUS
- Hospitalization records for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia
- At least ONE hospitalization in past 12 months
- ER records may count if led to admission

**For 100% Rating:**
- All requirements of 40%, PLUS
- TWO OR MORE hospitalizations for DKA or severe hypoglycemia in past 12 months

**Important:** Hypoglycemic episodes requiring assistance at home (family giving glucose tabs) do NOT count - must require hospitalization.

### 4. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Diabetes diagnosed during service
- Service medical records documenting diabetes
- Continuity of treatment from service to present
- **Note:** Less common unless older veteran or special circumstances

**Presumptive Service Connection:**

**Agent Orange Exposure:**
- Service in Vietnam (1962-1975)
- Service in Korea DMZ (1968-1971)
- Service in Thailand at specified bases
- C-123 aircraft exposure
- Type 2 diabetes is PRESUMPTIVE - no nexus required

**Gulf War Presumptive (Proposed):**
- VA is considering adding Type 2 diabetes as Gulf War presumptive
- Check current status

**Secondary Service Connection (Common):**

Diabetes secondary to another service-connected condition:

**Common Primary Conditions:**
- **PTSD:** Chronic stress, poor health behaviors, weight gain, medications
- **Medications:** Steroids for service-connected conditions, antipsychotics
- **Obesity (if secondary):** Obesity from service-connected condition → diabetes
- **Pancreatic conditions:** Pancreatitis, pancreatic injury → diabetes
- **Cushing's syndrome/Adrenal disorders:** Hormonal
- **Metabolic syndrome:** From other service-connected conditions

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing pre-diabetes or mild diabetes significantly worsened by service or service-connected condition

### 5. Nexus Opinion

Medical opinion linking diabetes to service or service-connected condition (unless presumptive).

**For Agent Orange:**
- No nexus required - presumptive service connection
- Just need proof of Vietnam/Thailand/DMZ/C-123 service and Type 2 diabetes diagnosis

**For Secondary Claims:**

**Strong Nexus Includes:**
- Review of medications and timeline
- Medical explanation of connection
- "At least as likely as not" statement
- Supporting literature

**Example Nexus (Secondary to Medications):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's Type 2 diabetes is secondary to long-term corticosteroid use for service-connected COPD. Chronic steroid use is a well-established cause of diabetes through insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. The veteran's diabetes developed after 10 years of prednisone use, supporting this connection."

**Example Nexus (Secondary to PTSD):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's Type 2 diabetes is secondary to service-connected PTSD. PTSD is associated with increased diabetes risk through multiple mechanisms: chronic stress and cortisol elevation, poor health behaviors, weight gain, and metabolic effects of psychiatric medications. The temporal relationship supports this connection."

## Claim Strategy

### Initial Claim Strategy

**Step 1: Establish Diabetes Diagnosis**
- Ensure clear diagnosis in medical records
- Get HbA1c and fasting glucose documented
- See endocrinologist if possible

**Step 2: Document Treatment Level**
- If on oral medications only: 10%
- If on insulin: minimum 20%
- If on insulin + carb counting + activity regulation: 40%
- If hospitalized for DKA/hypoglycemia: 60% or 100%

**Step 3: Determine Service Connection Path**

**Agent Orange (Vietnam/Thailand/DMZ/C-123):**
- Type 2 diabetes is PRESUMPTIVE
- File with proof of service in qualifying location/unit
- No nexus required

**Secondary to Service-Connected Condition:**
- Identify primary condition (PTSD, medication use, obesity, etc.)
- Get nexus opinion
- Document timeline

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Diabetes diagnosed during service (rare)
- Service medical records

**Step 4: File for Diabetes AND All Complications**

File separate claims for:
- Diabetes (DC 7913)
- Peripheral neuropathy (DC 8520) - if numbness/tingling in feet
- Retinopathy/vision problems (various DCs)
- Kidney disease (DC 7528)
- Erectile dysfunction (DC 7522)
- Heart disease (DC 7005)
- Any other complications

**Step 5: File Comprehensively**
Submit:
- VA Form 21-526EZ

### Agent Orange Presumptive Strategy

**Easiest Path for Vietnam Veterans:**

**Requirements:**
1. Service in Vietnam between 1962-1975 (boots on ground or brown water Navy)
2. Type 2 diabetes diagnosis
3. File claim

**That's it. No nexus required.**

**Evidence:**
- DD-214 showing Vietnam service
- Medical records confirming Type 2 diabetes diagnosis

This is one of the simplest VA claims for qualified veterans.

### Secondary Claim Strategy

**Diabetes Secondary to Steroid Use:**

Very common and strong medical connection.

**Evidence:**
1. Service-connected condition requiring steroids (COPD, asthma, autoimmune, skin conditions, etc.)
2. Documentation of chronic steroid use (prednisone, etc.)
3. Diabetes diagnosis after starting steroids
4. Nexus: Steroids cause diabetes

**Diabetes Secondary to Atypical Antipsychotics:**

Certain psychiatric medications increase diabetes risk.

**Evidence:**
1. Service-connected mental health condition treated with atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, etc.)
2. Diabetes developed after starting medication
3. Nexus: Medications cause insulin resistance and diabetes

### Higher Rating Strategy

**Moving from 10% to 20%:**
- Start insulin (based on medical necessity, not for rating purposes)
- Document insulin use

**Moving from 20% to 40%:**
- Document that you use insulin (already have this)
- Document restricted diet with carbohydrate counting
- Document regulation of activities
- Need ALL THREE

**Evidence:**
- Dietitian appointments showing carb counting instruction
- Meal plans
- Blood sugar logs showing checking before/after meals and exercise
- Personal statement explaining how you must regulate diet and activities

**Moving to 60% or 100%:**
- Very difficult - requires hospitalization for DKA or severe hypoglycemia
- Not advisable to try to achieve this - dangerous
- If you are hospitalized, file for increase with discharge records

**Strategy:**
- DD-214 showed Vietnam service 1968-1969
- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 2010
- Filed as Agent Orange presumptive - no nexus required
- Using insulin: automatically 20%
- Also filed for peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes
- Neurological exam showed decreased sensation both feet

**Result:**
- Diabetes: 20% (presumptive service connection)
- Peripheral neuropathy bilat: 20% + 20% = 36% + bilateral factor = 39.6%
- **Combined: 51% → paid at 60%** ($1,361.88/month)

**Key Factors:** Agent Orange presumptive (easy), filed for complications separately, comprehensive claim.

### Case Study 2: Diabetes Secondary to Steroid Use - 20%
**Background:** Air Force veteran, service-connected COPD treated with prednisone for 15 years, developed diabetes.

**Strategy:**
- Service-connected COPD at 30%
- Medical records showed chronic prednisone use 2005-2020
- Diabetes diagnosed 2018
- Started insulin 2020
- Endocrinologist provided nexus: "Type 2 diabetes is secondary to chronic corticosteroid use. Steroids cause insulin resistance and glucose intolerance."
- Timeline: Normal glucose pre-steroids, diabetes after years of steroid use

**Result:** Granted 20% for diabetes secondary to medication for service-connected COPD. Combined rating increased from 30% to 44% → paid at 50%.

**Key Factors:** Clear medication history, nexus from specialist, timeline supporting causation.

### Case Study 3: Increase from 20% to 40% with Documentation
**Background:** Navy veteran, Type 1 diabetes, initially rated 20% for insulin use.

**Strategy:**
- Already service-connected at 20% for insulin use
- Documented carbohydrate counting at all meals
- Saw dietitian, got meal plans and carb counting education
- Personal statement: "I count carbs at every meal. I cannot eat freely. I must plan every meal around my insulin dosing."
- Activity regulation documented: "I must check blood sugar before, during, and after exercise. I adjust insulin based on planned activity. I carry glucose everywhere. I've had to stop running due to unpredictable blood sugar drops."
- Updated C&P exam confirmed insulin use, carb counting system, and activity regulation

**Result:** Increased from 20% to 40% ($333.01 to $755.28/month).

**Key Factors:** Documented all three requirements (insulin, restricted diet, activity regulation), dietitian records, detailed personal statement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### If I use insulin, do I automatically get 20%?
If service connection is established, yes. Insulin use = minimum 20% rating.

### Do GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic or Trulicity count as insulin?
No. These are injectable medications but they are NOT insulin. They would fall under the 10% category (oral or injectable non-insulin medication).

### How do I get 40% for diabetes?
You must have ALL THREE: (1) insulin use, (2) restricted diet with carb counting/exchange system, and (3) regulation of activities. Document all three thoroughly.

### Does my HbA1c matter for the rating?
No. Ratings are based on treatment required, not how well-controlled your diabetes is. Even if your HbA1c is perfect, you're still rated based on whether you need oral meds, insulin, etc.

### Can I get more than 20% if I'm on a lot of insulin?
Not based solely on insulin dose. To get 40%, you need insulin PLUS carb counting PLUS activity regulation. Amount of insulin doesn't change the rating.

### Are diabetic complications rated separately?
Yes, and this is very important. File separate claims for neuropathy, retinopathy, kidney disease, ED, heart disease, etc. These can significantly increase your combined rating.

### Do I qualify for Agent Orange presumptive?
If you served in Vietnam 1962-1975, or Korea DMZ 1968-1971, or Thailand at specified bases, or had C-123 exposure, AND you have Type 2 diabetes, yes - it's presumptive. No need to prove causation.

### Can Type 1 diabetes be service-connected?
Yes, but more difficult. Type 1 is autoimmune and usually develops in childhood/young adulthood. Would need to show onset during service or nexus to service. Less common than Type 2.

### Will my diabetes rating be reduced if my control improves?
Not if you're still on the same treatment. If you're rated 20% for insulin use and you still use insulin, rating stays. If you no longer need insulin, rating could potentially be reduced to 10%.

### Can diabetes be secondary to PTSD?
Yes. PTSD increases diabetes risk through chronic stress, poor health behaviors, weight gain, and medication effects. Need medical nexus opinion.

### What if I'm hospitalized for high blood sugar but not DKA?
60% and 100% ratings require hospitalization specifically for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia. Regular hospitalizations for high blood sugar without DKA don't meet the criteria.

### Can I file for diabetes if I have pre-diabetes?
Pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) is not a disability rating. Must have actual diabetes mellitus diagnosis.

### How do I prove I count carbs for the 40% rating?
Dietitian appointments, meal plans, carb counting guides, food journals, personal statement explaining your system. Must show you follow structured carbohydrate counting or exchange system.

## Final Thoughts

Diabetes is a serious chronic condition requiring lifelong management. For Vietnam veterans, Type 2 diabetes is a presumptive condition - one of the easier VA claims to win. For other veterans, secondary service connection to medications or other conditions is common.

**Keys to a Successful Diabetes Claim:**

1. **Get diagnosed and treated properly** - For your health first
2. **Determine service connection path:**
   - Agent Orange presumptive (easiest for Vietnam vets)
   - Secondary to medications or other conditions (common)
   - Direct service connection (rare)
3. **Document treatment level:**
   - Oral meds = 10%
   - Insulin = 20%
   - Insulin + carb counting + activity regulation = 40%
   - Hospitalizations for DKA/hypoglycemia = 60% or 100%
4. **File for ALL complications separately:**
   - Neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, ED, heart disease, etc.
   - These can dramatically increase combined rating
5. **Get strong nexus** (unless presumptive)
6. **Be thorough and detailed**

**Remember:** Diabetes complications should be rated separately. A veteran with 20% diabetes and 40% neuropathy has a combined rating of 52% → paid at 60% ($1,361.88/month vs. $333.01 for diabetes alone).

Diabetes requires constant vigilance, lifestyle modifications, and medication adherence. If it's connected to your service or service-connected conditions, you deserve compensation.

**File your diabetes claim. Manage your health. Get the benefits you earned.**
