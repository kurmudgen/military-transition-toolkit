## Bottom Line Up Front

0351 Infantry Assaultmen (now reclassified as 0311 Riflemen as of 2020) developed **demolitions expertise, breaching operations, explosives handling, rocket systems proficiency, precision under pressure, and the ability to execute complex technical procedures with zero error margin**—skills that translate directly to EOD work, blasting careers (mining/quarry/construction), law enforcement (especially SWAT/tactical teams), security, corrections, and skilled trades. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$45,000-$67,000**, with experienced professionals hitting **$90,000-$120,000+** in civilian EOD, commercial blasting, federal law enforcement, or overseas contracting. You'll need specific certifications and possibly a degree, but your demolitions and breaching experience is a specialized foundation.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

The Marine Corps phased out MOS 0351 Infantry Assaultman in October 2020, reclassifying everyone as 0311 Riflemen. Combat engineers now handle breaching and demolition duties in rifle companies.

If you held the 0351 MOS, you might feel like your specialized training was wasted. Here's the truth: **your demolitions and breaching experience is actually valuable in multiple civilian sectors.**

You weren't just "blowing stuff up." You:
- Calculated demolition charges for structural breaching with mathematical precision
- Handled explosives (C4, TNT, det cord) following strict safety protocols
- Operated rocket systems (SMAW, AT-4) requiring technical proficiency
- Employed APOBS (Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System) in complex scenarios
- Led assault teams through high-risk breaching operations
- Maintained accountability for Class V (explosives) with zero tolerance for error
- Made real-time decisions about charge placement, blast radius, and safety distances
- Executed multi-step demolition procedures under extreme pressure
- Trained other Marines on explosives safety and employment

That's **technical expertise with explosives, mathematical calculations, precision operations, safety management, team leadership, and stress tolerance**. Those skills translate to legitimate civilian careers in commercial blasting, EOD, law enforcement, mining, construction, and more.

## Best civilian career paths for 0351

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where former 0351s successfully land, with current 2025 salary data.

### Commercial blasting and explosives work (highest skills match)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Blaster (mining, quarry, construction)
- Explosives worker
- Blast crew supervisor
- Powder technician
- Demolition specialist
- Rock blasting technician

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level blaster:** $45,000-$55,000
- **Experienced blaster:** $57,000-$75,000
- **Blast supervisor / powder foreman:** $70,000-$90,000
- **Senior blaster / project manager:** $85,000-$110,000

**What translates directly:**
- Explosives handling and safety protocols
- Calculating charges, blast radius, and timing
- Understanding of demolition principles
- Following strict safety procedures

- **MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) training** (if working in mining sector)
- **OSHA explosives handling certification**
- **1+ year documented experience** under licensed blaster (required for licensure in most states)

**Reality check:**
This is the most direct translation of your 0351 skills. Mining, quarrying, construction, and demolition companies need trained blasters. Your military demolitions training is a massive advantage—many employers specifically seek veterans with explosives experience.

Entry process: Most companies hire you as an explosives helper/trainee while you document experience hours under a licensed blaster (typically 1 year required), then you test for your state blaster license.

Major employers: Orica, Dyno Nobel, Austin Powder Company, Vulcan Materials, Martin Marietta, local quarry operations, construction firms.

Work is often remote (mine sites, quarries, construction sites), physical, and weather-dependent. But demand is consistent and pay is solid.

**Best for:** Former 0351s who want to directly use their demolitions training and don't mind physical outdoor work in industrial settings.

### EOD and UXO (unexploded ordnance) remediation

**Civilian job titles:**
- EOD technician (civilian)
- UXO technician
- Explosive ordnance disposal specialist
- Munitions response specialist
- Range clearance technician

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level UXO tech:** $55,000-$70,000
- **Experienced EOD technician:** $75,000-$95,000
- **Senior EOD specialist:** $95,000-$120,000+

- **UXO technician certification** (programs like CISA or similar civilian explosives training)
- **Hazmat certifications**
- **OSHA 40-hour HAZWOPER certification**
- **Security clearance** (massive advantage if you held one)

**Reality check:**
True EOD work typically requires formal EOD school (military or civilian equivalent). Your 0351 demolitions training is a foundation, but civilian EOD employers often want dedicated EOD school graduates (Navy EOD, Army 89D, etc.).

UXO remediation is more accessible. Companies clear old military ranges, construction sites, and overseas conflict zones of unexploded ordnance. Your explosives background makes you a strong candidate with additional certification.

Overseas UXO work pays extremely well but involves deploying to former conflict zones (Europe, Southeast Asia, Middle East) for 6-12 month contracts. Dangerous work, but compensated accordingly.

Domestic work includes former military ranges, construction sites where ordnance is discovered, and government contracts. More stable but lower pay than overseas.

**Best for:** Former 0351s with strong technical aptitude who want to work with ordnance in a civilian capacity and are willing to get additional EOD/UXO certifications.

### Law enforcement and tactical teams (common path)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Police officer
- Deputy sheriff
- State trooper
- SWAT team member
- Federal law enforcement (ATF, DEA, USMS, FBI)
- Bomb squad technician

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level municipal police:** $48,000-$62,000
- **State trooper:** $67,000-$70,000
- **Federal agent (GS-7 to GS-9 entry):** $56,000-$79,000
- **SWAT team member:** $70,000-$95,000 (base + specialty pay)
- **Bomb squad technician:** $75,000-$110,000

**Certifications needed:**
- **POST (Peace Officer Standards and Training)** certification—earned through police academy after hire (4-6 months)
- **Associate's degree in Criminal Justice** (required or strongly preferred)
- **Physical fitness standards**
- **Background check and polygraph**
- **SWAT/tactical certifications** (earned after years on patrol, not entry-level)

**Reality check:**
You won't join SWAT immediately. You'll work patrol for 3-5 years before being eligible for tactical teams. But your 0351 breaching and demolitions background makes you an ideal SWAT candidate when opportunities arise.

Bomb squad positions specifically value your explosives experience. These are specialized assignments after years on the force, but your military demolitions training is directly relevant.

Hiring timeline is long (6-12 months from application to academy). Veterans preference applies to federal positions and many state/local departments.

ATF specifically recruits veterans with explosives backgrounds. Your 0351 experience is particularly valued there.

**Best for:** Former 0351s who want structure, mission-focused work, opportunity to use tactical skills long-term, and are willing to work patrol before specializing.

### Private security and overseas contracting

**Civilian job titles:**

- Personal security detail (PSD)
- Static security specialist
- Maritime security operator
- Training instructor / advisor

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level OCONUS security:** $75,000-$95,000
- **PSD contractor:** $95,000-$140,000
- **High-threat environment contractor:** $130,000-$200,000+
- **Maritime security:** $80,000-$120,000

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing military-adjacent work.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Security clearance** (Secret or Top Secret—huge advantage if you held one)
- **High Threat PSD training**
- **Advanced weapons certifications**
- **Combat lifesaver or EMT** (not required but highly valued)
- **Recent deployment experience**

**Reality check:**
Contracting pays well but is demanding. Expect 12+ hour days, 6-7 days per week, in hostile or austere environments. Work is contract-based and cyclical—you might work 6-9 months then have 2-3 months off (unpaid).

Your 0351 background (breaching, demolitions, assault operations) makes you competitive for higher-tier contractor positions, especially if you have recent combat deployments and active clearance.

Post-9/11 contracting boom has cooled. Jobs exist in Africa, Middle East, and other regions, but competition is higher and contracts are shorter than 10-15 years ago.

Not a sustainable 20-year career for most, but an excellent way to bank serious money in your 20s and early 30s.

**Best for:** Young former 0351s with recent deployments, clearances, and willingness to work overseas in high-threat environments for significant compensation.

### Corrections and detention

**Civilian job titles:**

- **Physical fitness standards**

**Reality check:**
Corrections is hard work but fast hiring compared to police. Veteran preference applies. Federal BOP offers law enforcement retirement (retire at 50 with 20 years).

Federal BOP increased base pay by $2,000 in February 2024 due to staffing shortages. Actively recruiting veterans.

Many former 0351s use corrections as stable income while pursuing other certifications or waiting for police/federal positions.

**Best for:** Former 0351s needing immediate steady income who can handle high-stress environments.

### Skilled trades and construction

**Civilian job titles:**

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest. There are civilian skills you'll need to develop.

**Computer skills:** If your computer experience is limited to checking email and PowerPoint briefs, you're behind. Most jobs require Microsoft Office proficiency, especially Excel. Take free LinkedIn Learning or YouTube courses. Learn Excel basics at minimum.

**Civilian blasting calculations:** Your military demolitions math is a foundation, but civilian blasting uses different formulas, powder factors, and blast design principles. You'll learn this during your blaster training and apprenticeship under a licensed blaster.

**Licensing and regulations knowledge:** Civilian explosives work is heavily regulated (ATF, MSHA, state agencies). You'll need to learn applicable regulations, permitting, storage requirements, and documentation. This comes with your blaster training.

**Customer service and communication:** Marines are trained to be direct and aggressive. Civilian employers want de-escalation and professional communication. Adjust your communication style significantly.

**Resume and interview skills:** Civilian job applications are completely different. Use [Military Transition Toolkit](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com) to translate your 0351 experience into civilian-friendly language.

**Patience with bureaucracy:** Civilian hiring is slow. Background checks take months. Licensing processes take time. Stay patient and keep moving forward.
