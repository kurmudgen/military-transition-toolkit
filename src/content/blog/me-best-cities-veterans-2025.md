1. **South Portland leads for overall value** - VA clinic, jobs, quality of life
2. **Lewiston/Auburn leads for affordability** - $230K median, VA clinic, low cost of living
3. **Augusta leads for VA hospital access** - Togus right in town
4. **Kittery leads for federal employment** - Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
5. **All cities benefit from zero state tax on military retirement**
6. **Property tax savings $450-$760 annually** with veteran + homestead exemptions

Maine offers exceptional quality of life for military retirees, but housing costs vary dramatically. Unlike sunbelt states, Maine provides four seasons, coastal beauty, and low crime - but you'll pay for it in housing (southern Maine) and endure real winters.

The best city for you depends on priorities: VA access (South Portland/Augusta), jobs (Kittery/Brunswick), affordability (Lewiston/Bangor), or coastal charm (Brunswick/Scarborough).
