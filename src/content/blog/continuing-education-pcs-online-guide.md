# Continuing Education While PCSing: Online Options Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

PCS moves don't have to interrupt your education. **Fully online programs** allow you to continue coursework from any duty station, including OCONUS. The keys to success are choosing **PCS-proof programs** (no residency requirements, military-friendly policies), **planning ahead** for moves, and **protecting your progress** through credit transfer strategies. You can complete degrees, certifications, and professional development regardless of how often you move.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Traditional education fails military spouses:
- Start degree at one location, can't finish
- Credits don't transfer
- Mid-semester PCS disrupts everything
- Lose momentum and motivation

Select programs designed for mobility, create systems that survive chaos, and leverage online learning to make location irrelevant.

## Protecting Your Progress

## Success Stories

**Amanda, Army Spouse - BSN Across 3 Duty Stations**
"I started my BSN at SNHU in Texas, continued through Germany, and graduated while stationed at Fort Lewis. The program was 100% online. When we PCS'd, I just kept logging in. Clinical placements were the only local piece, and SNHU's placement team found sites at each location."

**Marcus, Navy Spouse - MBA During Deployment**
"I completed my MBA through WGU during my wife's deployment. The competency-based format meant I could go fast when I had time and slow when I didn't. I finished in 14 months, less than half the normal time, because I was motivated and had evening hours free."

**Priya, Marine Corps Spouse - Certifications Through Chaos**
"I gave up on degrees and focused on certifications that I could complete in 3-6 months each. Got my PMP, then my SHRM-CP, then data analytics through Google. Each one was online, and each one made me more employable. Shorter timelines = less PCS disruption."
