# VA Buddy Statements: How to Get Powerful Supporting Evidence

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Buddy statements** (lay statements) are written accounts from people who have witnessed your condition or service-related events. They're **free, powerful evidence** that can make or break your VA claim—especially when medical records are incomplete. Fellow service members can verify in-service incidents. Family can describe daily symptoms the VA never sees. A strong buddy statement can fill gaps in your record and support service connection. **Every veteran should include buddy statements with their claim.**

## What Is a Buddy Statement?

A buddy statement is a written declaration from someone who has personal knowledge of:
- Your military service and in-service events
- Your medical condition and symptoms
- How your condition affects your daily life

The VA calls these "lay statements" or "lay evidence." Unlike medical evidence from doctors, lay evidence comes from non-medical observers—but it's still valuable evidence the VA must consider.

**Legal basis:** Under 38 CFR § 3.303, lay evidence can establish:
- In-service incurrence (what happened during service)
- Current symptoms (what you experience now)
- Continuity of symptoms (what's continued since service)

## Why Buddy Statements Matter

### 1. They Fill Gaps in Medical Records

Military medical records are often incomplete. You might have:
- Never reported an injury (toughed it out)
- Lost records in personnel transfers
- Had incidents not documented

A buddy who witnessed the incident can provide the missing evidence.

### 2. They Prove What Doctors Can't

Doctors document what they observe during appointments. They don't see:
- How you function at home
- Your symptoms at night
- Your daily limitations
- The in-service event that caused your condition

Buddies who live with you or served with you can testify to all of this.

### 3. They Support Service Connection

For conditions claimed years after service, the VA questions the connection. Buddy statements can:
- Verify symptoms began during service
- Document continuity of symptoms since service
- Corroborate in-service stressors (for PTSD)

### 4. They're Free and Easy

Unlike nexus letters ($500-2,000), buddy statements cost nothing. Ask someone who was there to write down what they saw.

## Who Should Write Buddy Statements?

### Fellow Service Members

**Best for:**
- Verifying in-service events or injuries
- Confirming combat exposure or stressors
- Documenting conditions observed during service
- Establishing that symptoms existed in service

**Example uses:**
- PTSD: "I witnessed [veteran] during [combat incident]"
- Back injury: "I saw [veteran] hurt his back during the training exercise"
- Hearing loss: "Our squad was exposed to weapons fire daily without proper hearing protection"

### Spouse or Partner

**Best for:**
- Documenting current daily symptoms
- Describing nightmares, sleep issues (PTSD, sleep apnea)
- Observing limitations at home
- Witnessing changes since military service

**Example uses:**
- PTSD: "My husband wakes up screaming from nightmares 3-4 times per week"
- Sleep apnea: "I've witnessed my wife stop breathing during sleep"
- Depression: "He isolates himself and rarely leaves the house"

### Family Members (Parents, Siblings, Children)

**Best for:**
- Observing changes from before/after service
- Documenting family impact
- Describing symptoms during visits

**Example uses:**
- Mental health: "My son was outgoing before deployment. Now he won't come to family events"
- Physical: "My brother used to be active. Now he can't walk without pain"

### Friends and Neighbors

**Best for:**
- Observing mobility limitations
- Witnessing symptoms in social settings
- Documenting assistance provided

### Coworkers or Supervisors

**Best for:**
- Documenting work limitations
- Verifying missed work due to condition
- Describing accommodations needed

## What Makes a Strong Buddy Statement

### Include These Elements

1. **Writer identification**
   - Full name
   - Relationship to veteran
   - Contact information

2. **Personal knowledge statement**
   - How they know the veteran
   - How long they've known the veteran
   - Why they're qualified to make these observations

3. **Specific observations**
   - What they witnessed
   - When they witnessed it (dates or timeframes)
   - Where it occurred
   - Specific details

4. **Impact description**
   - How the condition affects the veteran
   - Changes observed over time
   - Daily limitations witnessed

5. **Certification**
   - Statement that the information is true
   - Signature
   - Date

### Be Specific

**Weak:** "John has back pain."

**Strong:** "I served with John in the 101st Airborne from 2010-2012. During a training jump at Fort Bragg in March 2011, I witnessed him land hard and immediately grab his lower back in pain. He had difficulty standing and had to be helped off the drop zone. After that incident, John frequently complained of back pain and I saw him using ice packs and taking painkillers. He was no longer able to carry his full combat load without stopping to rest."

### Include Dates and Details

Vague statements don't help. Include:
- Approximate dates or timeframes
- Specific locations
- Particular incidents
- Frequency of observed symptoms

### Describe What You Saw, Not Conclusions

**Less effective:** "John definitely has PTSD from combat."

**More effective:** "I've observed John have what appear to be flashbacks. During a Fourth of July gathering in 2019, fireworks started and John immediately dropped to the ground, crawled behind a car, and was shaking. His wife had to talk to him for several minutes before he would stand up. He told me afterward that loud noises make him feel like he's back in Iraq."

## How to Get Buddy Statements

### Step 1: Identify Potential Writers

Make a list of people who:
- Served with you and witnessed relevant events
- Live with you and observe your daily symptoms
- Work with you and see your limitations
- Have known you before and after service

### Step 2: Explain What's Needed

Contact each person and explain:
- You're filing a VA disability claim
- You need a written statement about what they've observed
- Provide them with a template or guidance
- Explain this is legal documentation (honesty is required)

### Step 3: Make It Easy

- Provide a template
- Offer to interview them and write a draft they can review and sign
- Give them specific questions to answer
- Set a deadline

### Step 4: Review and Submit

- Review each statement for completeness
- Ensure it's signed and dated
- Submit with your claim or as supplemental evidence

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague Statements

**Problem:** "John served honorably and has problems now."

**Fix:** Include specific observations, dates, and details.

### Mistake 2: Medical Conclusions

**Problem:** "John definitely has PTSD at 70%."

**Fix:** Describe symptoms observed, not diagnoses or ratings.

### Mistake 3: Only Getting One Statement

**Problem:** One buddy statement may not be enough.

**Fix:** Get multiple statements from different perspectives (service member + spouse + coworker).

### Mistake 4: Not Submitting Statements

**Problem:** Veteran gathers statements but forgets to submit them.

**Fix:** Include buddy statements with your initial claim or as early supplemental evidence.

### Mistake 5: Unsigned or Undated

**Problem:** Statement without signature or date has reduced credibility.

**Fix:** Always include signature, printed name, date, and contact information.

## Buddy Statements by Claim Type

### PTSD Claims

Focus on:
- Stressor verification (what combat/trauma was witnessed)
- Observable symptoms (nightmares, flashbacks, hypervigilance)
- Changes in personality/behavior since service

### Physical Injury Claims

Focus on:
- In-service incident (what happened, when, where)
- Symptoms observed during service
- Current limitations observed

### Secondary Claims

Focus on:
- How primary condition leads to secondary condition
- Observable symptoms of secondary condition
- Timeline of symptom development

### Increase Claims

Focus on:
- Worsening of condition over time
- New or more severe symptoms
- Increased impact on daily life

## The Bottom Line

Buddy statements are **free, powerful evidence** that every veteran should include with their claim. They:
- Fill gaps in medical records
- Prove what doctors don't see
- Support service connection
- Cost nothing

Don't file a claim without them. Ask fellow service members, family, and anyone who has witnessed your condition or service-related events to provide written statements.

Their words could be the evidence that wins your claim.
