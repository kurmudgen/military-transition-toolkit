# Best Cities in North Carolina for Veterans 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Raleigh ranks #1 for North Carolina veterans—it offers excellent job opportunities in the Research Triangle Park tech corridor, strong veteran community (47,844 in Wake County), proximity to Durham VA Medical Center (30 minutes), outstanding schools, and median home prices around $450,000. Fayetteville takes #2 for veterans specifically due to its massive veteran population (52,831 in Cumberland County—highest in NC), direct access to Fayetteville VA Medical Center, Fort Liberty proximity, and significantly lower housing costs at $225,000 median.

For quality of life and amenities, Charlotte (#3) offers the best urban experience with big-city amenities, major employers like Bank of America (6,800+ veterans nationwide), and median homes at $399,000. Cary (#4) provides suburban safety, excellent schools, and proximity to Raleigh jobs, but at premium prices ($598,000 median).

North Carolina's statewide challenge is rising housing costs—median home prices increased 10-15% in most metros from 2023-2025. However, the state's strengths offset this: full military retirement income tax exemption saves $1,700-$3,400 annually, 100% disabled veterans get $45,000 property tax exclusion (potentially rising to $500,000 if Senate Bill 660 passes), and veteran unemployment is just 2.6% (better than national 3.0%). North Carolina ranks 5th nationally for military presence.

Overall, NC cities excel for veteran employment, military-friendly culture, and moderate cost of living (compared to coastal states). Best for veterans prioritizing job opportunities, military community, healthcare access, and warm climate. Housing affordability varies dramatically—Fayetteville and Greensboro offer sub-$300K homes; Raleigh, Charlotte, and Asheville run $400K-$600K+.
