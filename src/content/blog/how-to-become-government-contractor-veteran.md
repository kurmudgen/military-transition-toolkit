# How to Become a Government Contractor: Complete Veterans Guide to Defense Contracting

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Transitioning to government contracting is the easiest path for veterans.** Defense contractors **actively recruit military personnel**—they need security clearances, understanding of military needs, and personnel they can trust. You can be hired in **6-12 months** from ETS to first contractor job. **Cost: $0** (firm pays). **Salary: $70K-$100K starting (if cleared), $100K-$150K within 5 years, $150K-$250K+ as senior/specialist.** Pension: Often more generous than private sector.

**Your advantage:** If you have security clearance, you're worth +$20K-$50K immediately. Military experience + clearance = gold in contracting.

## Why Government Contractors Need Veterans

Simple economics: Federal government spends trillions on defense. Contractors bid to win contracts. They need people who understand:
- Military operations and needs
- Security compliance and clearance procedures
- Military culture and language
- High-security, high-stakes environments
- Reliability and accountability

Veterans check all these boxes.

**Specific advantages:**
- **Security clearance:** Worth $20K-$50K premium. Already vetted.
- **Military experience:** You understand customer (DoD) needs intimately
- **Trustworthiness:** Military background assumed reliable
- **Compliance:** You understand regulations, procedures, rules
- **Stability:** Not going to job-hop chasing money (contractors value stability)

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge #1: "I Don't Have a Security Clearance"

**Reality:** Not a problem. Contractor will sponsor you.

**Timeline:**
- Secret clearance: 6-12 months to process
- TS clearance: 12-18 months
- You can work on unclassified projects while it processes
- Pay adjusted upward once cleared

**Salary impact:** You start $15-20K lower, but jump up once cleared

### Challenge #2: "I Don't Have Technical Background"

**Reality:** Many contractor roles aren't technical.

**Options:**
- Operations/logistics support
- Security roles
- Program management
- Training/administration
- Personnel management

**You can absolutely get contractor job without technical background.**

### Challenge #3: "Which Contractor Should I Work For?"

**Reality:** All major contractors are similar in pay, benefits, culture.

**Differentiators:**
- **Large contractors** (Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing): Stability, benefits, slower growth, bureaucracy
- **Mid-size** (ManTech, CACI): Faster growth, more autonomy, bit less stability
- **Small** (specialized): High growth potential, less stable, more interesting work

**Recommendation:** Start at mid-size or large. Stability is good when transitioning. Move to smaller/specialized once you understand contractor world.

### Challenge #4: "Is Working for Contractors Patriotic?"

**Reality:** Yes. Contractors support military mission.

**Why it's legitimate:**
- Contractors support military operations
- Government explicitly contracts with private firms
- You're enabling military capability
- Better than leaving the mission entirely

**Perspective:** You're extending your service through different uniform. Still mission-focused.
