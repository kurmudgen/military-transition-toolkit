# C&P Exam for Sleep Apnea: What the VA is Looking For (2025)

Sleep apnea is one of the most valuable VA disability claims, with a 50% rating for veterans who use a CPAP machine. But the C&P exam can make or break your claim—especially when it comes to proving service connection.

This guide covers exactly what the examiner is looking for and how to prepare.

## What the Examiner Will Determine

The sleep apnea C&P exam has two goals:

1. **Confirm your diagnosis and severity** (determines rating level)
2. **Provide nexus opinion** (determines if it's service-connected)

### What Determines Your Rating

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Asymptomatic but documented |
| **30%** | Persistent daytime hypersomnolence |
| **50%** | Requires CPAP or other breathing assistance device |
| **100%** | Chronic respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, or requires tracheostomy |

**The key question for rating**: Do you use a CPAP?

If yes → 50% minimum (once service-connected)

### What Determines Service Connection

**The key question for nexus**: Is your sleep apnea at least as likely as not related to military service?

This is where most sleep apnea claims fail. The examiner must provide a medical opinion.

## What Happens During the Exam

### Review of Records

The examiner reviews:
- Your claims file
- Sleep study results
- CPAP prescription
- Treatment records
- Service treatment records

### Medical History Questions

- When did you first notice sleep problems?
- When were you diagnosed with sleep apnea?
- What are your current symptoms?
- Do you use a CPAP? How often?
- Have you had any surgeries for sleep apnea?

### Service Connection Questions

**For direct claims:**
- Did you have sleep problems during service?
- Did anyone notice you snoring or stopping breathing during sleep in the military?
- Did you experience daytime fatigue during service?

**For secondary claims:**
- What service-connected condition do you believe caused your sleep apnea?
- How are they related?

### Current Symptom Assessment

- Do you experience daytime sleepiness?
- Do you fall asleep easily during the day?
- How many hours do you sleep at night?
- Do you feel rested when you wake up?
- Do you use your CPAP every night?

### Physical Examination

The examiner may:
- Check your airway and throat
- Measure neck circumference
- Assess your weight
- Check for any anatomical factors

## The Nexus Opinion: Where Claims Succeed or Fail

### Why Nexus Matters

Sleep apnea is rarely diagnosed during service. Most veterans weren't tested. This means the VA needs a medical opinion connecting your current sleep apnea to service.

### What Examiners Consider

**For direct connection:**
- In-service symptoms (documented snoring, fatigue, witnessed apneas)
- Environmental exposures (burn pits, chemicals)
- Timeline of symptom onset

**For secondary connection:**
- Your service-connected condition(s)
- Medical literature supporting the connection
- Physiological mechanism explaining the link

### Common Nexus Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Secondary to PTSD (Strong)**
Medical literature supports PTSD → sleep disturbance → sleep apnea. If you're rated for PTSD, this is a strong argument.

**Scenario 2: Secondary to Weight Gain from Service-Connected Conditions (Moderate)**
If orthopedic conditions prevent exercise and you gained weight, that weight gain contributes to sleep apnea.

**Scenario 3: Direct from Burn Pit Exposure (Varies)**
PACT Act covers some respiratory conditions as presumptive, but sleep apnea is not currently presumptive. You'd need to argue airway damage from exposure.

**Scenario 4: In-Service Symptoms (Challenging without Records)**
Without documentation from service, you rely on buddy statements and your testimony about symptoms.

## How to Prepare

### Before the Exam

**1. Know your sleep study results**
- What was your AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index)?
- When was the study done?
- What type (in-lab or home)?

**2. Have CPAP documentation**
- When was it prescribed?
- What settings?
- Do you have compliance data?

**3. Prepare your service connection argument**

For secondary claims:
- Know which condition(s) you're linking to
- Understand the medical connection
- Have any supporting literature

For direct claims:
- Prepare to discuss in-service symptoms
- Have buddy statements ready about snoring during service

**4. Document current symptoms**
- Daytime sleepiness frequency
- Sleep quality
- Impact on daily life

### What to Bring

- Copy of sleep study results
- CPAP prescription
- CPAP compliance data (if available)
- List of service-connected conditions (for secondary claims)
- Buddy statements about snoring during service (for direct claims)
- Medical literature supporting secondary connection (optional but helpful)

## During the Exam: Tips

### For the Rating Determination

**Confirm CPAP use:**
"Yes, I use my CPAP every night. I can't sleep without it."

**Describe symptoms without CPAP:**
"Without the CPAP, I wake up choking, I snore so loud it wakes my wife, and I'm exhausted all day."

**Mention daytime sleepiness:**
"Even with CPAP, I still struggle with fatigue. I have to fight to stay awake during meetings."

### For Service Connection (Secondary Claims)

**Clearly explain your theory:**
"My sleep apnea is secondary to my service-connected PTSD. I've had severe sleep disturbance since my PTSD began, and research shows PTSD significantly increases the risk of sleep apnea through stress-related changes to upper airway function."

**Connect the dots:**
"Since my back injury, I couldn't exercise and gained 50 pounds. My weight gain directly contributed to developing sleep apnea."

### For Service Connection (Direct Claims)

**Describe in-service symptoms:**
"My bunkmates used to complain about my snoring. They said I stopped breathing at night and it scared them. I was always exhausted during the day even after sleeping 8 hours."

**Explain why you weren't diagnosed:**
"We didn't have sleep studies available. I didn't know sleep apnea was a thing. I just thought I was a heavy snorer."

## Common Questions and How to Answer

### "When did your symptoms start?"

**Good answer:**
"I started noticing symptoms around [year], about [X years] after service. However, looking back, I had symptoms during service—my roommates complained about my snoring, and I was always tired. I just didn't know it was sleep apnea."

### "Do you use your CPAP?"

**Good answer:**
"Yes, every night. I can't function without it. Before I was prescribed the CPAP, I was falling asleep at work and couldn't stay awake driving."

### "What service-connected condition do you believe caused this?"

**Good answer:**
"My sleep apnea is secondary to my PTSD. My psychiatrist explained that the chronic stress and hypervigilance from PTSD affects sleep architecture and upper airway function. Multiple studies have shown veterans with PTSD have significantly higher rates of sleep apnea."

### "Did you have sleep problems during service?"

**Good answer:**
"Yes. My bunkmates constantly complained about my snoring. Several times they told me I stopped breathing at night. I was chronically tired despite getting enough sleep. I just didn't know what was wrong—sleep apnea wasn't something we were educated about."

## If You Don't Have In-Service Documentation

Most sleep apnea claims don't have in-service documentation because:
- Sleep studies weren't routinely done
- Snoring wasn't considered a medical issue
- Daytime fatigue was attributed to military schedule

### What Helps

**Buddy statements:**
Fellow service members describing:
- Your snoring during service
- Witnessed breathing stops
- Daytime fatigue they observed

**Spouse/partner statements:**
If married during service:
- Snoring history going back to service
- Sleep patterns observed

**Secondary connection:**
If direct connection is weak, focus on secondary to:
- PTSD/anxiety
- Weight gain from other service-connected conditions
- Other respiratory conditions

## What If the Examiner Gives a Negative Nexus?

### During the Exam

If the examiner seems skeptical:
- Stay calm and factual
- Clearly explain your theory
- Mention any supporting medical literature

### After a Negative Opinion

You can appeal with:
- **Private nexus letter** from your own doctor or specialist
- **Independent Medical Opinion** from a medical expert
- **Additional buddy statements**
- **Medical literature** supporting your theory

Many sleep apnea claims succeed on appeal with a strong private nexus opinion.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to bring my CPAP machine?

No, but bring documentation of the prescription and any compliance data.

### What if my sleep study was done years after service?

That's normal. Focus on secondary connection or document in-service symptoms through buddy statements.

### Does my AHI score affect my rating?

No. Rating is based on treatment required (CPAP = 50%), not severity of AHI.

### What if I can't tolerate my CPAP?

You may still qualify for 50% based on the prescription and medical necessity. Document why you can't tolerate it.

### Can the examiner order a new sleep study?

Usually they rely on existing studies, but they can recommend additional testing if needed.

### How long is the sleep apnea exam?

Typically 20-30 minutes. It's more record review and interview than physical examination.

## Bottom Line

The sleep apnea C&P exam primarily determines service connection. The rating is straightforward if you use CPAP (50%), but the nexus opinion is crucial.

Key takeaways:
- Know your sleep study results and CPAP prescription details
- Prepare your service connection argument (secondary is usually strongest)
- Have buddy statements for direct connection claims
- Clearly explain the connection to the examiner
- Be ready to appeal with private nexus if necessary

With proper preparation, sleep apnea is a very winnable claim.
