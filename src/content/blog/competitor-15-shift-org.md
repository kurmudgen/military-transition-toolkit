## 8. MTT Opportunity

### Complementary:
1. **Serve non-tech veterans** - 80%+ excluded by Shift's tech focus
2. **Comprehensive transition** - SkillBridge placement + VA claims + benefits

4. **Post-SkillBridge support** - Relocation, benefits, financial planning after tech job secured
5. **Career pivot tools** - What if tech isn't right fit after SkillBridge?

### Positioning:
**"All careers, all locations"** vs tech-only, hub-only

**"SkillBridge + comprehensive transition"** - Shift gets tech job, MTT handles rest of life

- Veterans outside tech hubs
- Post-SkillBridge veterans needing benefits support
- Tech veterans who need VA claims, relocation, financial planning

Shift serves **niche (tech) exceptionally well** but excludes vast majority. MTT should **serve everyone else** and provide **comprehensive support** (VA claims, benefits, housing) that Shift doesn't offer even to their tech placements.

**No direct competition** - Different audiences. **Partnership potential:** MTT as comprehensive transition platform for Shift's tech placements.
