## Understanding Hypertension VA Ratings

Hypertension is rated under 38 CFR § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Ratings are based either on diastolic blood pressure levels or the need for continuous medication to control blood pressure.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** **Diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more**, OR **Systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more**, OR **Requiring continuous medication for control**.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Diagnosed hypertension
- Takes daily blood pressure medication (most common scenario)
- Blood pressure controlled with medication
- Any medication for BP control qualifies (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, etc.)
- Even if BP well-controlled on medication, still rates 10%

**Monthly:** $171.23

**Most Common Rating** - if you take daily BP medication, you qualify for 10%.

**Blood Pressure Levels for 10%:**
- Diastolic ≥ 100 OR
- Systolic ≥ 160
- Readings taken on at least 3 different days

#### 20% Rating
**Criteria:** **Diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more**, OR **Systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more**.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Higher blood pressure levels
- May be on multiple medications
- BP not fully controlled despite treatment
- Elevated readings on multiple occasions

**Monthly:** $333.01

**Blood Pressure Levels for 20%:**
- Diastolic ≥ 110 OR
- Systolic ≥ 200
- Despite treatment

#### 40% Rating
**Criteria:** **Diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more**, OR **Systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more, with episodes of acute congestive heart failure**, OR **More than one transient ischemic attack (TIA)**.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Severely elevated blood pressure

- 2+ TIAs

#### 60% Rating
**Criteria:** **Diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more**, OR **Systolic pressure predominantly 230 or more**, OR **Sustained ventricular tachycardia or other severe cardiac arrhythmia**, OR **One or more stroke-like events (CVA) with residual neurological deficits**.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Extremely high blood pressure
- Life-threatening complications
- Stroke with residuals
- Severe cardiac arrhythmias

**Monthly:** $1,361.88

**Rare** - reserved for most severe hypertension with major complications.

## Key Point: Medication Requirement

**Most Important:** If you take medication daily to control your blood pressure, you automatically qualify for **at least 10%**, regardless of how well-controlled your BP is with medication.

**Qualifying Medications:**
- ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, enalapril, etc.)
- ARBs (losartan, valsartan, etc.)
- Beta blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, etc.)
- Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, diltiazem, etc.)
- Diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, etc.)
- Alpha blockers
- Central acting agents
- Vasodilators

**ANY medication prescribed for blood pressure control = 10% minimum**

---

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Medical Diagnosis

**Required:**
- Medical records documenting hypertension diagnosis
- Blood pressure readings showing elevated BP
- Typically: 3+ elevated readings on different days

**Hypertension Definition:**
- **Normal BP:** <120/<80
- **Elevated:** 120-129/<80
- **Stage 1 Hypertension:** 130-139/80-89
- **Stage 2 Hypertension:** ≥140/≥90
- **Hypertensive Crisis:** >180/>120

**Types:**
- **Essential (Primary) Hypertension:** Most common, no identifiable cause
- **Secondary Hypertension:** Caused by another condition (kidney disease, sleep apnea, medications, etc.)

### 2. Blood Pressure Readings Over Time

**Documentation Needed:**
- Multiple BP readings from medical records
- Home BP monitoring log (if available)
- Readings showing BP levels (for ratings above 10%)
- Readings before and after medication (shows medication necessity)

**"Predominantly" Means:**
- Majority of readings at or above the threshold
- VA will average readings
- Typically needs readings from at least 3 occasions

**Important:** Readings should be from different days to establish consistent elevation.

### 3. Medication Documentation

**Required for 10% Rating:**
- Prescription records showing BP medication
- Medication list in medical records
- Refill history (shows continuous use)
- Dosages

**Multiple Medications:**
- Taking 2+ BP medications may indicate more severe hypertension
- Supports higher rating if BP still not well-controlled
- Document all medications and dosages

### 4. Target Organ Damage (For Higher Ratings)

**Evidence of Complications:**
- **Heart:** Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH on EKG or echo), heart failure, coronary artery disease
- **Brain:** TIAs, strokes (CVA), cognitive impairment
- **Eyes:** Hypertensive retinopathy (eye exam)
- **Kidneys:** Chronic kidney disease, protein in urine
- **Blood vessels:** Peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm

**These complications can be rated separately** in addition to hypertension rating.

### 5. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection (Less Common):**
- Hypertension diagnosed during service
- Service medical records showing elevated BP
- Continuity of treatment from service to present

**Note:** Hypertension during service is less common unless older veteran or other medical conditions present.

**Secondary Service Connection (Most Common):**

Hypertension secondary to another service-connected condition:

**Common Primary Conditions:**
- **PTSD:** Chronic stress, hyperarousal increase BP
- **Sleep Apnea:** Well-established connection - sleep apnea causes hypertension
- **Kidney Disease:** Renal hypertension
- **Diabetes:** Diabetic complications affect blood vessels
- **Chronic Pain:** Constant pain increases stress and BP
- **Medications:** Steroids, NSAIDs can raise BP
- **Obesity (if secondary):** Increases hypertension risk
- **TBI:** Neurological regulation of BP affected

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing mild hypertension significantly worsened by service or service-connected condition

### 6. Nexus Opinion

Medical opinion linking hypertension to service or service-connected condition.

**Strong Nexus Includes:**
- Review of medical records and BP history
- Medical explanation of connection
- Timeline (when hypertension developed)
- "At least as likely as not" statement
- Supporting medical literature

**Example Nexus (Secondary to Sleep Apnea):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's hypertension is secondary to service-connected sleep apnea. Medical literature clearly establishes that obstructive sleep apnea significantly increases hypertension risk through multiple mechanisms: chronic intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic nervous system activation, and endothelial dysfunction. The veteran's hypertension developed after sleep apnea diagnosis, and BP improved with CPAP compliance, supporting this connection."

**Example Nexus (Secondary to PTSD):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's hypertension is secondary to service-connected PTSD. Chronic hyperarousal, elevated stress hormones, and sympathetic nervous system overactivity in PTSD are well-established causes of hypertension. Additionally, PTSD medications can contribute to elevated blood pressure. The temporal relationship and mechanism support service connection."

- **Secondary:** Identify service-connected condition causing or contributing to hypertension (most common)

**Step 3: Identify Secondary Connection**

**Most Common Secondary Connections:**

**Hypertension Secondary to Sleep Apnea:**
- Very strong medical connection
- Sleep apnea → intermittent hypoxia → sympathetic activation → hypertension
- High success rate

**Hypertension Secondary to PTSD:**
- Chronic stress and hyperarousal increase BP
- PTSD medications can contribute
- Medical literature support

**Hypertension Secondary to Chronic Pain:**
- Constant pain increases stress hormones and BP

- Medical literature may help
- Independent Medical Opinion (IMO) if needed

**Step 5: File Comprehensively**
Submit:
- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Medical records with hypertension diagnosis
- BP readings over time
- Medication records
- Nexus letter
- Personal statement
- Evidence of primary service-connected condition (if secondary)

### Simple 10% Strategy

**If you take daily BP medication, you qualify for 10%.**

**Requirements:**
1. Diagnosed hypertension
2. Prescribed medication for BP control
3. Taking medication continuously
4. Service connection (usually secondary)

## Success Stories

### Case Study 1: Hypertension Secondary to Sleep Apnea - 10% Rating
**Background:** Army veteran, service-connected for sleep apnea at 50%, developed hypertension 2 years after sleep apnea diagnosis.

**Strategy:**
- Medical records documented development of hypertension after sleep apnea
- BP readings: Pre-sleep apnea diagnosis: 125/80, After sleep apnea: 145/95
- Started on lisinopril 10mg daily
- Primary care physician provided nexus: "Hypertension is at least as likely as not secondary to sleep apnea. OSA is well-established cause of hypertension through intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic activation."
- Medical literature attached showing sleep apnea-hypertension link

**Result:** Granted 10% for hypertension secondary to sleep apnea ($171.23/month). Combined rating increased from 50% to 55%.

**Key Factors:** Clear temporal relationship, medical nexus with literature support, continuous medication requirement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I automatically get 10% if I take blood pressure medication?
Yes, if you take medication continuously for blood pressure control, you qualify for at least 10%, as long as you establish service connection.

### Does it matter if my blood pressure is well-controlled with medication?
No. For the 10% rating, what matters is that you require continuous medication. Even if your BP is perfectly controlled, you still rate 10%.

### Can I get higher than 10% if I'm on multiple BP medications?
Possibly. Higher ratings are based on BP levels despite treatment. If your BP is still elevated (diastolic ≥110) despite multiple medications, you may qualify for 20% or higher.

### How do I prove hypertension is secondary to PTSD?
Get a nexus letter from your doctor (psychiatrist or primary care) explaining that chronic stress from PTSD causes elevated blood pressure. Medical literature strongly supports this connection.

### Is hypertension secondary to sleep apnea easy to prove?
Yes. The sleep apnea-hypertension connection is very well-established medically. This is one of the more straightforward secondary claims.

### What if I had high blood pressure before service?
You may still qualify through aggravation. Show that service or a service-connected condition significantly worsened your pre-existing hypertension.

### Can complications of hypertension be rated separately?
Yes. Heart disease, kidney disease, stroke residuals, etc., can be rated separately from the hypertension itself, significantly increasing combined rating.

### How many BP readings do I need for higher ratings?
Typically at least 3 readings from different days showing BP at or above the threshold. VA will average your readings.

### Will my rating be reduced if my BP improves with treatment?
For 10% rating based on medication requirement, no - you still need medication. For higher ratings based on BP levels, if BP significantly improves and stays lower, rating could potentially be reduced.

### Can hypertension be secondary to chronic pain?
Yes. Chronic pain increases stress hormones and sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to hypertension. Get medical nexus opinion.

### Do home BP readings count?
They can be helpful supporting evidence, especially if showing elevated readings. However, VA will rely primarily on BP readings from medical appointments.

### What if my BP is only high at doctor's offices (white coat hypertension)?
This is still hypertension if it's consistently elevated at medical visits and requires treatment. May need home monitoring to clarify diagnosis.

### Can hypertension be service-connected in young veterans?
Yes, especially as secondary to conditions like sleep apnea, PTSD, kidney disease, or from medications. Hypertension in younger people often has identifiable causes.

### Do I need to see a cardiologist?
Not required, but can be helpful. Primary care physicians commonly diagnose and treat hypertension. Cardiology evaluation helpful if complications or difficult-to-control BP.

## Final Thoughts

Hypertension is a common condition in veterans, often developing as a consequence of service-connected conditions like PTSD, sleep apnea, chronic pain, or kidney disease. While 10% may seem like a modest rating, it provides lifelong compensation (over $82,000 in 40 years) and combines with other conditions.

**Keys to a Successful Hypertension Claim:**

1. **Get diagnosed and treated** - Take BP medication as prescribed
2. **Identify secondary connection** - Sleep apnea, PTSD, chronic pain, kidney disease
3. **Document medication requirement** - Prescription records showing continuous use
4. **Get strong nexus** - Medical opinion connecting hypertension to service-connected condition
5. **File for complications separately** - Heart disease, kidney disease, stroke if present
6. **Document BP readings** - Multiple readings over time for higher ratings

**Remember:** If you take daily BP medication and can establish service connection (usually secondary to another condition), you qualify for at least 10%.

Hypertension increases risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and other serious conditions. Taking medication and getting proper treatment is essential for your health. Filing for VA compensation recognizes the service-connection and provides financial support.

**File your hypertension claim. Protect your health. Get the compensation you earned.**
