## Key Takeaways

1. **Scottsdale and Gilbert lead nationally** - Ranked #7 and #15 respectively for veterans
2. **Phoenix offers best VA access** - Critical for veterans with complex medical needs
3. **Sierra Vista offers best affordability** - Ideal for fixed-income retirees
4. **Tucson balances affordability and services** - VA access + lower costs than Phoenix
5. **All cities benefit from zero state tax on military retirement** - Saves $2,000-$3,000+ annually
6. **Climate is major factor** - Choose low desert (hot) vs. high desert vs. mountains based on health and preferences

Arizona offers genuine value for military retirees, especially compared to California or Hawaii. Housing costs have risen but remain manageable outside luxury markets. The combination of tax benefits, warm climate (or mountain alternatives), and strong veteran communities makes Arizona a top-10 state for veteran retirement.

The best city for you depends on your priorities: employment (Gilbert/Chandler), quality of life (Scottsdale), healthcare (Phoenix/Tucson), affordability (Sierra Vista), or education (Tempe/Flagstaff).
