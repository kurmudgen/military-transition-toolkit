# VA Community Care: When VA Pays for Outside Doctors Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** VA-paid healthcare at non-VA facilities (private doctors, hospitals, specialists)
- **Who qualifies:** Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare who meet specific access criteria
- **When it applies:** When VA can't provide timely or accessible care
- **Key criteria:** Wait times over 20/28 days, distance over 30/60 minutes, or VA doesn't offer the service
- **Insider tip:** You have the RIGHT to request community care when you meet criteria—VA must authorize it

## What Is VA Community Care?

VA Community Care allows enrolled veterans to receive healthcare at non-VA facilities—paid for by VA. This was dramatically expanded under the VA MISSION Act of 2018.

**Instead of:**
- Driving 2 hours to the VA Medical Center
- Waiting 3 months for an appointment
- Not having access to needed specialists

**You can:**
- See a local private doctor
- Get faster appointments
- Access specialists VA doesn't have
- All paid by VA

**Community Care is available for:**
- Primary care
- Specialty care
- Mental health
- Urgent care
- Emergency care
- Specific services VA doesn't offer

## Who Qualifies for Community Care?

### Basic Eligibility

To receive Community Care, you must:

1. **Be enrolled in VA healthcare**
2. **Meet at least ONE of the access criteria (below)**
3. **Receive authorization from VA** (in most cases)

### The Access Criteria

You qualify for Community Care if ANY of the following apply:

#### Criteria 1: Service Not Available at VA

VA doesn't offer the specific service you need at any VA facility.

**Examples:**
- Specialized treatments not at your VAMC
- Rare specialists
- Certain procedures

#### Criteria 2: State Without Full-Service VA

You live in a state or territory without a full-service VA medical center:
- Alaska
- Hawaii
- New Hampshire
- U.S. territories

#### Criteria 3: Grandfather (40-Mile Rule)

You were eligible for care in the community under the Veterans Choice Program as of June 6, 2018.

#### Criteria 4: Wait Time Standards

**For primary care, mental health, and non-institutional extended care:**
- If you can't get an appointment within **20 days** of the date clinically appropriate
- Or within **20 days** of when you request care (whichever is later)

**For specialty care:**
- If you can't get an appointment within **28 days** of the date clinically appropriate
- Or within **28 days** of when you request care (whichever is later)

#### Criteria 5: Drive Time Standards

**For primary care, mental health, and non-institutional extended care:**
- Your average drive time to the nearest VA facility is more than **30 minutes**

**For specialty care:**
- Your average drive time to the nearest VA facility is more than **60 minutes**

#### Criteria 6: Best Medical Interest

VA determines it's in your best medical interest to receive care in the community.

**Examples:**
- Continuity of care (ongoing treatment with civilian provider)
- Quality concerns
- Special circumstances

### Community Care for Specific Programs

**Urgent Care:**
- Enrolled veterans can use approved urgent care facilities
- No pre-authorization needed for urgent issues
- Limited to 3 visits per year for most veterans

**Emergency Care:**
- Emergency room visits when VA is not accessible
- Must notify VA within 72 hours
- Follow-up care may require authorization

## How Community Care Works

### Step 1: Request Community Care

**During a VA appointment:**
- Tell your provider you want to discuss community care options
- Ask if you meet the access criteria
- Request a referral to a community provider

**By phone:**
- Call your VA Medical Center
- Ask for the Community Care department
- Explain which criteria you believe you meet

**Through My HealtheVet:**
- Send a secure message to your care team
- Request community care evaluation

### Step 2: VA Evaluates Your Request

VA will determine:
- Do you meet the access criteria?
- Is the requested care covered?
- What providers are available in your area?

### Step 3: Receive Authorization

If approved, VA will:
- Send you a referral/authorization
- Provide a list of approved community providers
- Give you instructions for scheduling

**Important:** You MUST receive authorization before getting care (except emergencies). Care without authorization may not be covered.

### Step 4: Schedule Appointment

You can:
- Choose from VA's approved provider list
- Schedule directly with the community provider
- Use VA's Community Care scheduling assistance

### Step 5: Receive Care

At your appointment:
- Bring your VA authorization
- Show your Veterans Health ID Card (VHIC)
- Don't pay anything (in most cases)

The community provider bills VA directly.

### Step 6: Follow-Up

After care:
- Records are sent to VA
- Follow-up care may need separate authorization
- Continue communicating with your VA care team

## Urgent Care Benefit

VA's urgent care benefit allows certain veterans to access approved urgent care facilities for minor injuries and illnesses.

**Eligibility:**
- Enrolled in VA healthcare
- Received VA care within the past 24 months

**Coverage:**
- 3 urgent care visits per year (for most veterans)
- No pre-authorization needed
- Must use VA-approved urgent care facilities

**How to use:**
1. Find an approved facility: VA.gov/find-locations (select "Urgent Care")
2. Present your VHIC
3. Receive care
4. Copay may apply based on priority group

**Not covered:**
- Emergency care (use ER)
- Prescriptions over 14-day supply
- Follow-up care (needs separate authorization)

## Emergency Care Coverage

VA covers emergency care when:
- The emergency is of a nature that a prudent person would have reasonably expected delay to be hazardous
- A VA or other Federal facility is not feasibly available
- Delay would be unsafe

**What to do:**
1. Get emergency care (don't wait for authorization)
2. Notify VA within 72 hours of admission
3. Call 1-844-724-7842 to report
4. Follow VA instructions for stabilization and transfer

**Important:** VA may transfer you to a VA facility once stabilized, or authorize continued care.

## Timeline

| Step | Timeframe |
|------|-----------|
| Request community care | Same day at appointment or by phone |
| VA evaluation | 1-5 business days |
| Authorization received | 1-2 weeks (can be expedited) |
| Schedule appointment | Depends on provider availability |
| Claims processing | Provider bills VA directly |

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Getting Care Without Authorization
Except for emergencies, always get VA authorization first. Unauthorized care may not be covered.

### 2. Not Knowing the Criteria
Many veterans don't realize they qualify. Know the wait time (20/28 days) and drive time (30/60 minutes) standards.

### 3. Using Non-Approved Providers
VA maintains a network of approved community providers. Using out-of-network providers may result in balance billing.

### 4. Not Reporting Emergencies
You have 72 hours to notify VA of emergency room visits. Missing this window can result in denied claims.

### 5. Forgetting to Request Ongoing Authorization
Each phase of care may need separate authorization. Don't assume one authorization covers everything.

### 6. Not Advocating for Yourself
If you believe you meet the criteria, speak up. VA staff may not automatically offer community care.

### 7. Paying Out of Pocket
Community care through VA should be free or have minimal copays. Don't pay the provider directly unless instructed by VA.

### 8. Not Providing Complete Information
Give the community provider your VA authorization and insurance information. Incomplete info causes billing issues.

## Maximizing Community Care Benefits

### Know Your Rights

Under the VA MISSION Act, you have the right to:
- Request community care when you meet criteria
- Choose from available community providers
- Receive a clear explanation if denied
- Appeal denied requests

### Track Wait Times

Document when you:
- Request an appointment
- Are offered an appointment
- Actually receive care

If VA's offered appointment exceeds wait standards, you qualify for community care.

### Use the Drive Time Calculator

VA uses specific mapping to calculate drive times. Check:
- VA.gov drive time tool
- Your actual drive time vs. VA's calculation
- Appeal if VA's calculation seems wrong

### Combine with VA Care

Community care works best when coordinated:
- Keep VA as your medical home
- Share community care records with VA
- Use VA for some services, community for others

### Appeal Denials

If denied community care:
1. Request written explanation
2. Review against MISSION Act criteria
3. File formal appeal if appropriate
4. Contact Patient Advocate for assistance

## How Community Care Stacks With Other Benefits

### Works With:
- **VA healthcare enrollment:** Required foundation
- **VA disability compensation:** Unaffected
- **Medicare/Medicaid:** VA may bill as secondary
- **Private insurance:** VA may bill to offset costs

### Important Notes:
- Community care copays follow VA priority group rules
- Some services may have copays even if VA care would be free
- Travel reimbursement may be available

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I choose any doctor for community care?**
A: No. You must use VA-approved community providers. VA maintains a network, or you can request a specific provider be added.

**Q: Do I pay the community doctor?**
A: Usually no. The provider bills VA directly. You may have a copay based on your VA priority group.

**Q: What if the community provider bills me?**
A: Contact VA immediately. This is often a billing error. VA's Community Care team can help resolve it.

**Q: How do I find approved community providers?**
A: Use VA.gov/find-locations and select "Community providers (in VA's network)." You can also call VA's Community Care line.
