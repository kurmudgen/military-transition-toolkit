# TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability): Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Compensation at the 100% rate when you can't maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities
- **Key benefit:** 100% pay ($3,737.85/month) even if your combined rating is less than 100%
- **Eligibility threshold:** One disability at 60%+ OR combined 70%+ with one at 40%+
- **Alternative path:** Extraschedular TDIU available even if you don't meet the threshold
- **Insider tip:** "Substantially gainful employment" is key—marginal employment doesn't disqualify you

## What Is TDIU?

Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU, also called IU) is a VA benefit that pays veterans at the 100% disability rate when they cannot work due to service-connected disabilities—even if their actual disability rating is less than 100%.

**The logic:**
- Your disabilities prevent you from working
- If you can't work, you're effectively 100% disabled
- You deserve 100% compensation

**Example:**
- Combined rating: 70%
- Can't work due to service-connected conditions
- TDIU grants: 100% pay rate ($3,737.85/month vs. $1,716.28 at 70%)
- **Monthly increase: $2,021.57**

## Who Qualifies?

### Schedular TDIU Requirements

To qualify for "schedular" TDIU, you need:

**Threshold Met:**
- ONE service-connected disability rated at **60% or more**, OR
- Combined rating of **70% or more** with at least ONE disability rated at **40% or more**

**Plus:**
- Unable to secure and follow **substantially gainful employment** due to service-connected disabilities

### Extraschedular TDIU

If you DON'T meet the schedular threshold but:
- Cannot work due to service-connected disabilities
- Have an exceptional case

VA may grant **extraschedular TDIU** through referral to the Director of Compensation Service.

### What Is "Substantially Gainful Employment"?

**Substantially gainful employment** means:
- Work that provides a living wage
- Not marginal employment
- Above the poverty threshold (approximately $15,000-18,000/year)

**Marginal employment** (doesn't disqualify you):
- Sheltered work environment
- Protected employment (family business giving you special treatment)
- Employment below poverty level
- Intermittent or sporadic work

### What About Part-Time Work?

Part-time work MAY still qualify you for TDIU if:
- Earnings are below substantially gainful threshold
- Work is in a protected environment
- You couldn't maintain the job without accommodations

### Disabilities That Count

Only **service-connected** disabilities count toward TDIU:
- Physical disabilities
- Mental health conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety)
- Combinations of conditions
- Secondary conditions

Non-service-connected conditions DO NOT count toward TDIU eligibility.

## Types of TDIU

### Schedular TDIU (Regular)

For veterans who meet the numeric thresholds:
- 60%+ single disability, OR
- 70%+ combined with 40%+ single

Most common path to TDIU.

### Extraschedular TDIU

For veterans who:
- Don't meet numeric thresholds
- Have exceptional circumstances
- Still can't work due to service-connected disabilities

Requires referral to VA Central Office.

### TDIU Protected (P&T)

Some TDIU ratings are:
- **Permanent and Total (P&T):** No future exams required
- **Subject to review:** May require periodic exams

P&T TDIU provides:
- No future employment questions
- Dependents eligible for certain benefits (Chapter 35 DEA)
- More security

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

**Employment history:**
- Last date of substantially gainful employment
- Reasons for leaving work
- Job applications and rejections
- Employer statements

**Medical evidence:**
- Doctor's opinion on employability
- How disabilities affect work capacity
- Functional limitations

**Educational background:**
- Highest education level
- Vocational training
- Skills and work history

### Step 2: Complete VA Form 21-8940

**VA Form 21-8940** (Application for TDIU):
- Employment history (5 years)
- Education and training
- Current income
- How disabilities prevent work

**Also complete VA Form 21-4192:**
- Request for Employment Information
- Sent to former employers for verification

### Step 3: Submit Claim

**Online:**
- VA.gov/disability
- Select "file for increased disability"
- Claim TDIU as part of increase

**By mail:**
- Download forms from VA.gov
- Mail to VA Evidence Intake Center

**In person:**
- Visit VA Regional Office
- Work with VSO to submit

### Step 4: Attend C&P Exam

VA may schedule Compensation & Pension exam:
- Be honest about limitations
- Describe your worst days
- Explain why you can't work
- Bring medical evidence

### Step 5: Decision

VA reviews:
- Whether you meet schedular threshold
- Whether you can't work due to SC conditions
- Employment history and medical evidence

## Evidence That Helps

### Medical Evidence

**Strong evidence:**
- Treating physician's opinion that you can't work
- Detailed functional capacity evaluation
- Psychiatrist/psychologist statement (for mental health)
- Documentation of symptoms and limitations

**What doctor should address:**
- Can you work 8 hours/day, 5 days/week?
- Can you maintain regular attendance?
- What limitations do you have?
- How do symptoms affect work?

### Employment Evidence

**Strong evidence:**
- Letters from employers about why you left
- Accommodations that weren't enough
- Job applications and rejections
- Vocational expert opinion

**Work history showing:**
- Pattern of job loss
- Failed attempts to work
- Declining income over time
- Inability to maintain employment

### Personal Statements

**Your statement should include:**
- How disabilities affect daily functioning
- Why you can't maintain employment
- What happens when you try to work
- Specific examples

**Buddy statements:**
- Family/friends observing limitations
- Coworkers describing problems at work
- Former supervisors (if supportive)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Working Above the Threshold

If you earn above substantially gainful employment threshold, TDIU will be denied or terminated.

**Solution:** Know the threshold (~$15,000-18,000/year)

### 2. Not Applying Because You're Not 100%

TDIU is specifically for veterans below 100% who can't work.

**Solution:** Apply if you can't work, even at 70%

### 3. Only Mentioning SC Conditions

Make sure VA knows how service-connected conditions (not non-service-connected) cause unemployability.

**Solution:** Focus evidence on SC conditions' impact

### 4. Incomplete Employment History

VA Form 21-8940 requires complete employment history.

**Solution:** Be thorough and accurate

### 5. Not Getting Medical Opinion

Generic statements aren't enough.

**Solution:** Get specific opinion on inability to work

### 6. Thinking You Can't Appeal

TDIU denials can be appealed.

**Solution:** Review reasons for denial and appeal

### 7. Not Claiming Secondary Conditions

If you don't meet the threshold, claim secondary conditions to reach 70%+.

**Solution:** File for all related conditions

### 8. Assuming Age Matters

TDIU is about disability, not age.

**Solution:** Apply regardless of age

## TDIU and Employment

### Can I Work at All?

**Marginal employment is allowed:**
- Below poverty threshold
- Protected/sheltered work
- Family business accommodation

**What's NOT allowed:**
- Substantially gainful employment
- Earning above the threshold
- Full-time competitive work

### What If I Start Working?

If you obtain substantially gainful employment:
- You must notify VA
- TDIU may be terminated
- You may receive regular rating instead

**Before starting work:**
- Consider impact on TDIU
- Consult with VSO
- Understand income thresholds

### VA Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E)

You can participate in VR&E while on TDIU:
- Training and education
- Goal is returning to work
- But TDIU continues during training

## TDIU vs. Schedular 100%

| Feature | TDIU | Schedular 100% |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Payment | $3,737.85/month | $3,737.85/month |
| Based on | Unemployability | Severity of conditions |
| Work allowed | Marginal only | Subject to rules |
| Chapter 35 DEA | If P&T | If P&T |
| SMC eligibility | May affect | May qualify |

Both pay the same amount, but schedular 100% is considered "stronger" because it's based purely on disability severity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between TDIU and 100% schedular?**
A: Both pay the same rate. TDIU is based on unemployability; schedular 100% is based on disability severity meeting 100% criteria.

**Q: Can I work while receiving TDIU?**
A: Only marginal employment (below poverty threshold, protected work). Substantially gainful employment disqualifies you.

**Q: What if I don't meet the 60%/70% threshold?**
A: You can request extraschedular TDIU, which doesn't require meeting the threshold.

**Q: Is TDIU permanent?**
A: Depends. Some TDIU is "P&T" (Permanent and Total), some is subject to review.

**Q: Does TDIU include dependent payments?**
A: Yes. You receive 100% rate plus dependent allowances.

**Q: Can I get TDIU for PTSD alone?**
A: Yes, if PTSD is rated 60%+ (or 70%+ combined with 40%+ single) and prevents work.

**Q: What about Social Security Disability?**
A: You can receive both. SSDI and VA TDIU are different programs.

**Q: Will VA schedule exams to check on TDIU?**
A: Possibly, unless you have P&T TDIU. Routine reviews are common.

**Q: Can TDIU be taken away?**
A: Yes, if VA determines you can work or are working substantially. P&T TDIU is more secure.

**Q: Does education level matter?**
A: Yes. VA considers whether you could work in jobs suited to your education and experience.

**Q: What if I'm in school?**
A: Education doesn't disqualify TDIU. Many veterans use VR&E or GI Bill while on TDIU.

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **Don't meet schedular threshold** - Rating not high enough
2. **Evidence shows you can work** - Recent employment, successful work history
3. **Non-SC conditions causing unemployability** - Must be service-connected
4. **Insufficient medical evidence** - No opinion on employability
5. **Currently employed** - Above marginal employment

### How to Appeal

1. **Request Higher-Level Review** - Same evidence, different reviewer
2. **Supplemental Claim** - Add new evidence (medical opinion, etc.)
3. **Board of Veterans Appeals** - Formal appeal

### Strengthening Your Case

- Get detailed medical opinion on unemployability
- Document failed work attempts
- Show pattern of job loss
- Get vocational expert opinion
- Address VA's specific denial reasons
