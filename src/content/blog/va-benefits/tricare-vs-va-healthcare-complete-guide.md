# TRICARE vs VA Healthcare: Which to Use When Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **TRICARE:** Health insurance for active duty, retirees, and dependents—access civilian providers with insurance model
- **VA Healthcare:** Healthcare system exclusively for veterans—use VA facilities or VA-approved community care
- **Key difference:** TRICARE is insurance (pay premiums, use any provider); VA is a healthcare system (enroll, use VA network)
- **Can use both:** Many veterans qualify for and use both systems strategically
- **Insider tip:** Retirees can use TRICARE for families and VA for themselves—maximizing benefits for everyone

## What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the Department of Defense's healthcare program for:
- Active duty service members

|-------|-----|--------|
| 1-3 | Service-connected disability 10%+ | Free or minimal |
| 4-6 | Special categories, combat vets | Generally free |

## Using Both: The Strategic Approach

Many veterans qualify for BOTH TRICARE and VA healthcare. Here's how to maximize:

### Common Strategy: Split Coverage

**Use VA for:**
- Your own primary care
- Mental health services
- Prescriptions (mail order)
- Service-connected condition care
- Specialty care VA does well

**Use TRICARE for:**
- Family members (spouse, children)
- Care when traveling
- Urgent care flexibility
- Services VA doesn't offer locally

### Cost Optimization

**Scenario: Military retiree, 30% disability**

Without strategy:
- TRICARE Prime: ~$700/year enrollment
- Uses TRICARE for everything

With strategy:
- VA for veteran's care: Free (Priority Group 2)
- TRICARE for family only
- Annual savings: Veteran's healthcare costs

### Prescription Strategy

**VA Prescriptions:**
- 90-day mail order
- $0-$11 copay per prescription
- Covers most medications

**TRICARE Prescriptions:**
- Military pharmacy: Free
- Mail order: Lower copay
- Retail pharmacy: Higher copay

**Best approach:** Use VA mail order for your medications; TRICARE for family prescriptions at military pharmacy when possible.

## Special Situations

### Military Retiree (20+ Years)

**You have:**
- TRICARE Prime or Select
- VA healthcare eligibility
- Both are valid options

**Recommendation:**
- Enroll in VA (no cost, additional access)
- Keep TRICARE for family
- Use VA for your care, TRICARE for family
- TRICARE as backup when traveling

### Medical Retiree (Chapter 61)

**You have:**
- TRICARE (retired status)
- VA healthcare eligibility
- Likely service-connected disability rating

**Recommendation:**
- VA is often better (free care, disability-related)
- TRICARE provides family coverage
- VA for service-connected care (free, no copays)

### Combat Veteran (Non-Retiree)

**You have:**
- No TRICARE (didn't retire)
- VA healthcare eligibility
- 5 years enhanced VA coverage

**Recommendation:**
- Enroll in VA immediately
- Use 5-year free healthcare window
- Consider ACA/marketplace insurance for family
- VA as primary healthcare source

### Guard/Reserve Member

**While drilling:**
- TRICARE Reserve Select available
- VA healthcare eligibility may be limited

**After discharge:**
- VA eligibility if federally activated (90+ days)
- No TRICARE unless retired

**Recommendation:**

- Enroll in VA if eligible
- Transition plan needed for after service

### Medicare-Eligible (65+)

**You have:**
- TRICARE for Life (free, Medicare wrap)
- VA healthcare eligibility
- Medicare Part A & B

**How it works:**
- Medicare pays first
- TRICARE for Life pays remainder

**Recommendation:**
- Keep TRICARE for Life (free)
- Use VA for specialized veteran care
- Three-layer coverage maximum protection

## Coordination of Benefits

### When Using Both

**Who pays first?**
1. TRICARE is always secondary to VA for veterans
2. VA bills TRICARE when applicable
3. Usually no out-of-pocket for veteran

**Important:**
- Tell both systems about your other coverage
- VA can bill TRICARE for certain services
- Doesn't affect your TRICARE benefits

### Claims and Billing

**At VA:**
- VA bills TRICARE directly
- You don't receive bills (usually)
- Helps VA recover costs

**At TRICARE providers:**
- TRICARE processes normally
- Not coordinated with VA
- You use one or the other per visit

## Making the Choice

### Use Primarily TRICARE If:

- VA facilities are inconvenient

### Use Primarily VA If:

- You're a single veteran or only covering yourself
- You have service-connected conditions
- You want lowest out-of-pocket costs
- You value veteran-specific care
- You're a combat veteran (5-year free care)

### Use Both If:

- You're a retiree with family (TRICARE for family, VA for you)
- You want maximum flexibility
- You have complex healthcare needs
- You want backup options

## Real Examples

**Annual savings vs. all TRICARE:** ~$500-1,000 in copays

### Example 2: Post-9/11 Combat Veteran

**Situation:**
- No TRICARE eligibility (didn't retire)
