## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use SAH to buy an already-adapted home?**

A: No. VA grants are not taxable income.

**Q: Can I use the grant on a rental property?**
A: No. Must be your primary residence that you own (or family member's home for TRA).

**Q: What if modifications cost more than the grant?**
A: You pay the difference. Grant is capped at maximum amount.

A: Generally no. Must use licensed contractor. Labor not covered if you do it yourself.

## Working with Contractors

### Finding Contractors

**Tips:**

- VA sends payments directly to contractor (usually)

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **Disability doesn't meet criteria** - Not severe enough or wrong type
2. **Not service-connected** - Disability from other cause
3. **Property issues** - Not your residence, not adaptable
4. **Documentation missing** - Need medical evidence

### How to Appeal

1. **Request explanation** in writing
2. **Gather additional evidence:**
   - Medical documentation
   - Specialist opinions
   - Functional limitations
3. **File appeal** through VA
4. **Consider VSO assistance**
