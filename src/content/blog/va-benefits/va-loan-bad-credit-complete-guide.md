# VA Loan with Bad Credit: Complete Guide to Getting Approved

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **VA has no minimum credit score:** The VA doesn't set a credit score requirement—lenders do
- **Typical minimums:** Most lenders require 580-620, some go as low as 500
- **Key advantage:** VA loans are more forgiving than conventional loans for credit issues
- **What matters most:** Payment history, debt-to-income ratio, and residual income
- **Insider tip:** Shop multiple lenders—their credit requirements vary significantly

## VA Credit Requirements Explained

### What VA Actually Requires

**The VA does NOT have a minimum credit score.**

VA guidelines focus on:
- Satisfactory credit history
- Ability to repay
- Stable income
- Residual income (money left after expenses)

**What VA looks for:**
- Payment patterns over past 12-24 months
- Explanations for any derogatory credit
- Overall credit risk assessment

### What Lenders Require

**Individual lenders set their own minimums:**

| Lender Type | Typical Minimum |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Banks (Wells Fargo, etc.) | 620-640 |
| Credit unions | 600-620 |
| VA-focused lenders | 580-620 |
| Non-QM/specialty lenders | 500-580 |

**The lender—not VA—determines if they'll approve you.**

## What Credit Score Do You Actually Need?

### Score Ranges and Reality

**740+:** Excellent - Best rates, easy approval
**700-739:** Good - Competitive rates, smooth process
**660-699:** Fair - Higher rates, additional scrutiny
**620-659:** Below average - Limited lenders, higher rates
**580-619:** Poor - Fewer lenders, much higher rates
**Below 580:** Very poor - Specialty lenders only, highest rates

### What Each Range Means

**620+ (Most lenders):**
- Most VA lenders will consider
- Straightforward approval process
- Competitive rates available

**580-619 (Some lenders):**
- Fewer lender options
- Higher interest rates
- Additional documentation likely
- Manual underwriting required

**500-579 (Few lenders):**
- Specialty lenders only
- Much higher rates
- Extensive documentation
- Compensating factors required

## What Hurts Your VA Loan Approval?

### Major Credit Issues

**Most damaging:**
- Bankruptcy (within 2 years)
- Foreclosure (within 2 years)
- Multiple recent late payments
- Collections/charge-offs
- High credit utilization

**Moderately damaging:**
- Single late payment (30+ days)
- Medical collections
- Old collections (5+ years)
- Short credit history

### Recent vs. Old Issues

**Recency matters:**
- Issues from 5+ years ago: Less impact
- Issues from 2-4 years ago: Moderate impact
- Issues from past 12 months: Significant impact

**Example:**
- Bankruptcy 5 years ago + clean credit since = Often approvable
- Late payment 3 months ago = May cause denial

## Compensating Factors That Help

### What Can Offset Bad Credit

**Strong compensating factors:**
1. Large down payment (5-10%+)
2. Significant cash reserves (6+ months)
3. Low debt-to-income ratio (under 35%)
4. Strong residual income (above VA minimum)
5. Long employment history (3+ years same job)
6. Excellent rent payment history
7. No recent late payments (past 12 months)

### How They Help

**Example scenario:**
- Credit score: 590
- Down payment: 10%
- Cash reserves: $30,000
- DTI: 32%
- Same job: 8 years
- No late payments in 2 years

**Result:** Compensating factors may overcome credit score concerns.

## Manual Underwriting

### What It Is

**Automatic underwriting:** Computer system approves/denies based on algorithm
**Manual underwriting:** Human underwriter reviews entire file individually

### When It's Required

**Manual underwriting typically required when:**
- Credit score below 620
- Recent bankruptcy or foreclosure
- No credit score (thin file)
- Multiple recent late payments

### Manual Underwriting Requirements

**Stricter requirements apply:**
- Maximum 45% DTI (vs. 50%+ for automatic)
- 12 months on-time rent history required
- Stronger residual income
- Detailed explanations for derogatory credit
- More documentation overall

## Specific Credit Situations

### After Bankruptcy

**Chapter 7 Bankruptcy:**
- Wait 2 years from discharge date
- Establish new credit during waiting period
- Explain circumstances in letter
- Show improved financial habits

**Chapter 13 Bankruptcy:**
- Can apply after 12 months of payments
- Need court approval
- Must have satisfactory payment history
- Trustee must approve new debt

### After Foreclosure

**VA foreclosure:**
- Wait 2 years minimum
- Entitlement may be reduced
- Need to restore entitlement (pay off debt to VA)

**Non-VA foreclosure:**
- Wait 2 years minimum
- Full entitlement available
- Explain circumstances

### After Short Sale

**Short sale:**
- May qualify immediately (varies by lender)
- Some want 2-year wait
- Need to explain circumstances
- Show improved credit since

### With Collections

**Collections on credit report:**
- Small collections (under $2,000 total) often overlooked
- Large collections may need to be paid
- Medical collections treated more leniently
- Payment plans may be acceptable

### With Student Loans

**Student loan considerations:**
- IBR plans: Use 1% of balance if $0 payment
- Standard plans: Use actual payment
- Default: Must be rehabilitated first

## How to Improve Your Chances

### Quick Credit Fixes (30-90 days)

**Immediately impactful:**
1. Pay down credit cards below 30% utilization
2. Become authorized user on family member's old card
3. Dispute errors on credit report
4. Pay small collections (get deletion agreement)
5. Don't open new accounts
6. Don't close old accounts

**Example impact:**
- Reducing utilization 70% → 25%: +20-50 points
- Removing erroneous late payment: +30-50 points
- Adding authorized user account: +15-30 points

### Medium-Term Improvements (3-12 months)

**Build positive history:**
1. Pay every bill on time
2. Get secured credit card, use responsibly
3. Credit-builder loan
4. Keep old accounts open
5. Mix of credit types

### Finding the Right Lender

**Shop based on your credit:**
- 620+: Shop all major lenders
- 580-619: Focus on VA-specialized lenders
- Below 580: Contact mortgage brokers, specialty lenders

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's your minimum credit score for VA loans?"
- "Do you do manual underwriting?"
- "What compensating factors do you accept?"

## Lenders That Work with Lower Credit

### Types of Lenders

**VA-focused lenders:**
- Often more flexible on credit
- Understand VA guidelines better
- May have lower minimums

**Mortgage brokers:**
- Access to multiple lenders
- Can find best fit for your situation
- One application, multiple options

**Credit unions:**
- Sometimes more flexible
- Relationship-based lending
- May consider full financial picture

### What to Look For

**Good lender for bad credit:**
- Clearly states minimum score
- Offers manual underwriting
- Experience with VA loans
- Willing to discuss compensating factors
- Transparent about rates/fees

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Shopping Multiple Lenders

One lender's decline ≠ all lenders decline. Shop around.

### 2. Applying Too Many Places at Once

Multiple hard inquiries hurt score. Shop within 14-45 days (counted as one inquiry).

### 3. Making Large Purchases Before Closing

Don't buy car, furniture, or anything on credit during process.

### 4. Changing Jobs During Application

Employment changes complicate approval. Wait until after closing.

### 5. Moving Money Around

Large deposits need explanation. Keep finances stable.

### 6. Ignoring Explanations

Lenders want explanations for negative items. Provide detailed letters.

### 7. Giving Up After One Denial

Denial from one lender doesn't mean you can't get approved elsewhere.

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **Credit score too low for that lender**
2. **Recent bankruptcy/foreclosure (timing)**
3. **High debt-to-income ratio**
4. **Employment/income issues**
5. **Property doesn't qualify**
6. **Missing documentation**

### What to Do

**Get specifics:**
- Request denial letter with reasons
- Ask what would need to change

**Try another lender:**
- Different lenders, different standards
- Mortgage broker can help find options

**Address issues:**
- Pay down debt (DTI)
- Wait for time to pass (bankruptcy)
- Build credit history
- Gather more documentation

### Timeline to Reapply

| Issue | Typical Wait |
|-------|--------------|
| Credit score too low | Improve score, reapply |
| Chapter 7 bankruptcy | 2 years from discharge |
| Chapter 13 bankruptcy | 12 months + court approval |
| Foreclosure | 2 years |
| Recent late payments | 12 months clean history |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get a VA loan with a 500 credit score?**
A: Possible but difficult. Very few lenders go this low. Expect high rates and extensive documentation.

**Q: Does VA check my credit?**
A: VA doesn't check credit—your lender does. VA just guarantees the loan.

**Q: Will my credit score affect my interest rate?**
A: Yes. Lower scores = higher rates. Could be 0.5-2% higher than someone with 740+ score.

**Q: Can I get VA loan with no credit score?**
A: Yes, through manual underwriting. You'll need alternative credit history (rent, utilities, etc.).

**Q: Does getting denied hurt my credit?**
A: The hard inquiry affects score slightly. Denial itself doesn't appear on credit report.

**Q: How long do negative items stay on credit report?**
A: Most items: 7 years. Bankruptcy: 7-10 years. But impact decreases over time.

**Q: Can I be a co-borrower to help qualify?**
A: Yes. Adding a co-borrower with better credit/income can help qualify.

A: Only if co-signer is also VA-eligible or is your spouse.
