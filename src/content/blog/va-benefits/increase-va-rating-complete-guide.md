# Increase Your VA Rating: When and How to File Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **When to file:** When your service-connected condition has gotten worse since last rated
- **Key evidence:** Medical records showing worsening, new symptoms, or increased limitations
- **What happens:** VA schedules new C&P exam to assess current severity
- **Risk:** Your rating can stay the same, increase, OR decrease
- **Insider tip:** Document your worst days—VA should rate based on flare-ups, not best days

## When Should You File for an Increase?

### Signs Your Rating Should Be Higher

**File for increase when:**
- Symptoms have worsened
- New symptoms have developed
- Treatment has increased (more medications, therapy, etc.)
- Daily functioning is more limited
- You can't do things you could before
- Your condition has required surgery or hospitalization

### Examples of Worsening

**Physical conditions:**
- Knee: Went from occasional pain to constant pain
- Back: Now need mobility aids (cane, walker)
- Shoulder: Lost more range of motion
- Hearing: Hearing has declined further

**Mental health:**
- PTSD: Symptoms more frequent/severe
- Depression: Now interfering with work
- Anxiety: Panic attacks happening more often
- Sleep: Insomnia worsened significantly

### When NOT to File

**Don't file if:**
- Condition is stable (no change)
- You're hoping for higher rating without evidence
- Your condition has actually improved
- You recently had a C&P exam with same findings

**Risk:** Filing for increase means VA can reevaluate and potentially REDUCE your rating.

## How to File for an Increase

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

**Medical evidence:**
- Recent treatment records
- New test results (imaging, lab work)
- Doctor's statements about worsening
- Specialist evaluations

**Personal evidence:**
- Personal statement describing changes
- Buddy/family statements observing changes
- Work records (if job affected)
- Photographs (if applicable)

**Key question:** Can you show your condition is WORSE than when last rated?

### Step 2: Complete VA Form 21-526EZ

**Claim for Increase:**
- Select "file a claim for increase"
- List the specific condition(s)
- Don't file for conditions that haven't changed

### Step 3: Submit Claim

**Online (recommended):**
1. Go to VA.gov/disability
2. Sign in
3. Select claim for increase
4. Submit evidence

**By mail:**
- Download VA Form 21-526EZ
- Attach evidence
- Mail to VA Evidence Intake Center

**Through VSO:**
- Work with Veterans Service Organization
- They can review your case
- Help prepare documentation

### Step 4: Attend C&P Examination

**VA will likely schedule exam:**
- Be honest about your condition
- Describe your WORST days
- Explain how symptoms affect daily life
- Don't minimize or exaggerate

**What examiner assesses:**
- Current symptoms
- Range of motion (for joint issues)
- Functional limitations
- Impact on work and daily activities
- Any new diagnoses or conditions

### Step 5: Await Decision

**Timeline:** 3-6 months typically

**Possible outcomes:**
- Rating increases
- Rating stays the same
- Rating decreases (yes, this can happen)

## Understanding C&P Exams for Increase Claims

### What to Expect

**Before the exam:**
- Review your medical records
- List all symptoms (don't forget any)
- Note how condition affects daily life
- Think about your worst days

**During the exam:**
- Describe symptoms honestly
- Explain functional impact
- Mention flare-ups
- Don't try to impress the examiner with toughness

**Key areas assessed:**
- Frequency of symptoms
- Severity of symptoms
- Duration of episodes
- Impact on occupational functioning
- Impact on social functioning

### The "Worst Day" Issue

**VA should consider:**
- Flare-ups
- Bad days
- Exacerbations
- Functional loss during episodes

**Many examiners only assess day-of-exam condition.** If the exam happens on a good day, your rating may not reflect your actual disability.

**What to do:**
- Explicitly tell examiner about bad days
- Describe what happens during flare-ups
- Explain how often flare-ups occur
- Request that flare-ups be documented

### DeLuca Factors (Joint Issues)

For musculoskeletal claims, VA must consider:
- Pain on movement
- Weakness
- Fatigability
- Incoordination
- Functional loss during flare-ups

**Insist on documentation of:**
- Where motion becomes painful (not just total range)
- Estimated loss during flare-ups
- Impact of repetitive use

## Evidence That Supports Increases

### Strong Evidence

**Medical records showing:**
- Increased medication dosages
- New medications added
- More frequent appointments
- Referrals to specialists
- Surgical procedures
- Hospitalizations

**Functional evidence:**
- Doctor's statement on functional limits
- Physical therapy records
- Work accommodations needed
- Activities you can no longer do

**Objective testing:**
- New X-rays showing progression
- MRIs showing structural changes
- Hearing tests showing decline
- Pulmonary function tests worsening

### Personal Statements

**Your statement should describe:**
- How symptoms have changed
- What you could do before vs. now
- Impact on work, family, daily tasks
- Frequency and severity of bad days
- Specific examples

**Buddy statements:**
- Family members observing changes
- Friends seeing decline
- Coworkers (if applicable)
- Concrete examples over time

## Rating Schedules and Criteria

### How VA Rates Conditions

Each condition has specific rating criteria in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD).

**Example: PTSD Rating Criteria**

| Rating | Criteria (Summary) |
|--------|-------------------|
| 0% | Diagnosed, but no functional impairment |
| 10% | Mild symptoms, controlled with medication |
| 30% | Occasional decrease in work efficiency |
| 50% | Reduced reliability and productivity |
| 70% | Deficiencies in most areas |
| 100% | Total occupational and social impairment |

**To increase rating:** Show you meet criteria for higher level.

### Know Your Criteria

**Before filing for increase:**
1. Look up your condition's rating criteria
2. Identify what level you're at
3. Determine what criteria you now meet
4. Gather evidence for those criteria

**Resources:**
- 38 CFR Part 4 (Rating Schedule)
- VA.gov condition-specific information
- VSO guidance

## Common Increase Claim Mistakes

### 1. Filing Without Evidence of Worsening

You need proof condition is worse, not just hope for higher rating.

### 2. Minimizing Symptoms at Exam

Don't be tough. Describe your actual limitations honestly.

### 3. Not Mentioning Flare-Ups

If symptoms fluctuate, make sure examiner documents worst periods.

### 4. Ignoring Secondary Conditions

Worsening primary condition may have created secondary conditions. Claim them too.

### 5. Not Requesting Exam on Bad Day

You can request a new exam if your exam was on an unusually good day.

### 6. Forgetting About Medications

Side effects can be separately ratable. Depression from pain meds, ED from PTSD meds, etc.

### 7. Not Knowing the Rating Criteria

Understand what VA looks for at each rating level.

### 8. Filing Too Soon After Previous Exam

Unless significant change occurred, wait for documented worsening.

## Proposed Reductions

### What Happens If VA Proposes Decrease

If your increase claim leads to proposed reduction:
1. VA sends "proposed reduction" letter
2. You have 60 days to respond
3. Can request hearing
4. Can submit evidence showing condition hasn't improved

### Protected Ratings

**5-year rule:** Ratings in place 5+ years require sustained improvement
**10-year rule:** Ratings in place 10+ years can only be reduced for fraud
**20-year rule:** Ratings in place 20+ years cannot be reduced

**Total disability (100%) ratings:**
- Cannot be reduced without exam
- Require clear improvement, not just one good exam

### Responding to Proposed Reductions

1. **Request hearing** within 30 days
2. **Submit evidence** within 60 days
3. **Get updated medical evaluation**
4. **Document that symptoms persist**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can my rating go DOWN if I file for increase?**
A: Yes. VA can reduce any rating not protected by 5/10/20 year rules.

**Q: How long does an increase claim take?**
A: 3-6 months typically, similar to initial claims.

**Q: Do I need a nexus letter for an increase?**
A: Not usually—service connection is already established. Focus on showing worsening.

**Q: What if my C&P exam was inaccurate?**
A: Request new exam. You can challenge exam findings in appeal.

**Q: Can I file for increase on 0% ratings?**
A: Yes! 0% ratings can increase if condition worsens.

**Q: How often can I file for increase?**
A: No limit, but only file when you have evidence of worsening.

**Q: Should I see my own doctor before filing?**
A: Yes. Updated medical records strengthen your claim.

**Q: What if examiner didn't consider flare-ups?**
A: Note this in your appeal. Exams must address functional loss during flare-ups.

**Q: Can I increase TDIU to schedular 100%?**
A: Yes. If conditions worsen to meet 100% schedular, claim it.

**Q: What about secondary conditions?**
A: If primary condition caused new problems, file for secondary service connection.

## If You're Denied an Increase

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **No evidence of worsening** - Records don't show change
2. **Exam shows stable condition** - C&P findings same as before
3. **Doesn't meet higher criteria** - Not severe enough for next level
4. **Improved** - Evidence suggests condition is better

### How to Appeal

1. **Review denial letter** for specific reasons
2. **Higher-Level Review** if you disagree with interpretation
3. **Supplemental Claim** with new evidence
4. **Board of Veterans Appeals** for formal appeal

### Strengthening Your Appeal

- Get private medical opinion
- Submit new treatment records
- Get DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire) from private doctor
- Address VA's specific denial reasons

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Knee Increase

**Current rating:** 10% for knee (painful motion)

**Evidence of worsening:**
- MRI shows cartilage has deteriorated
- Now using knee brace
- Physical therapy records show limited ROM
- Can no longer run or do prolonged standing

**C&P exam finds:**
- Limited flexion (less than 60 degrees)
- Pain throughout range
- Documented instability

**Result:** Increased to 30% for limitation of flexion + 10% for instability = Combined knee rating increase

### Example 2: PTSD Increase

**Current rating:** 50% for PTSD

**Evidence of worsening:**
- Started new medications (2 added)
- Missed work due to symptoms
- Relationship ended due to condition
- Hospitalization for crisis

**C&P exam finds:**
- Deficiencies in most areas
- Suicidal ideation (without intent)
- Social isolation
- Occupational impairment

**Result:** Increased to 70%

### Example 3: Denied Increase

**Current rating:** 30% for back

**Claim filed without:**
- Recent treatment records
- Evidence of worsening
- New symptoms documented

**C&P exam finds:**
- Same range of motion as previous exam
- Same reported symptoms
- No new imaging

**Result:** Denied - no evidence of worsening

**Lesson:** Build your evidence before filing.
