### How to Calculate Combined Rating

**VA Math Formula:**
```
Combined = 100% - [(100% - Rating A) × (100% - Rating B) × ...]
Then round to nearest 10%
```

### Example Calculation

**Ratings: 50%, 30%, 20%**

1. Start with 100
2. Apply 50%: 100 - 50 = 50 remaining
3. Apply 30%: 50 × 0.70 = 35 remaining
4. Apply 20%: 35 × 0.80 = 28 remaining
5. Combined: 100 - 28 = 72%
6. Rounded: **70%**
