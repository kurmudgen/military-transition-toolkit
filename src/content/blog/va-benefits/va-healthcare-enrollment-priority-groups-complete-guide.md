## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Enrolling at Discharge
Many veterans wait years to enroll. Combat veterans lose free healthcare years by waiting. Enroll immediately upon discharge.

### 2. Assuming You Don't Qualify
Eligibility is broader than most think. Even without service-connected disabilities, most veterans qualify.

### 3. Not Providing Income Information
Accurate income information ensures you're placed in the correct priority group. You may qualify for lower or no copays.

### 4. Forgetting About Combat Veteran Status
Combat veterans get 5 years of free care. This is separate from disability status.

### 5. Not Updating Information
Keep your address, income, and contact information current. Outdated info can cause enrollment issues.

### 6. Overlooking PACT Act Benefits
If you have toxic exposure, the PACT Act may give you new access to care. Don't assume old denials still apply.

### 7. Thinking VA Care Is Only for "Injured" Veterans
VA healthcare is for ALL eligible veterans, not just those with injuries or disabilities.

### 8. Not Getting Your Priority Group Reviewed
Your priority group can change if your disability rating changes or income changes. Request a review if circumstances change.

## How VA Healthcare Stacks With Other Coverage

### Medicare
- Can use both VA and Medicare
- VA is usually primary for most veterans
- Medicare can fill gaps VA doesn't cover
- No requirement to use one over the other

### TRICARE
- Active duty and retiree coverage
- VA coverage is separate benefit
- Can use both (coordinate with both)
- Some veterans use TRICARE for dependents, VA for self

### Private Insurance
- VA can bill private insurance for some care
- Doesn't affect your out-of-pocket costs at VA
- Helps VA recover some costs

### Medicaid
- Medicaid eligibility may qualify you for Priority Group 5
- Can use both programs
- VA and Medicaid coordinate for maximum coverage
