# VA Loan Funding Fee: What You'll Pay and Exemptions Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** One-time fee charged on VA loans to help fund the program for future veterans
- **Amount:** 0.5% to 3.3% of loan amount depending on down payment and usage
- **Key exemption:** Veterans receiving VA disability compensation pay NOTHING
- **Can be financed:** Roll it into your loan to avoid out-of-pocket payment
- **Insider tip:** Apply for VA disability BEFORE closing—even a 0% rating exempts you from the funding fee

## What Is the VA Funding Fee?

The VA funding fee is a one-time payment made at closing that helps sustain the VA loan program. Unlike private mortgage insurance (PMI) that protects the lender, the funding fee supports the VA's ability to guarantee loans for future veterans.

**Key points:**
- Charged on most VA loans (purchase, refinance, cash-out)
- Varies based on down payment, loan type, and prior usage
- Can be paid at closing or financed into the loan
- Significant exemptions exist for disabled veterans

## How to Finance the Funding Fee

### Rolling Into Your Loan

**Most veterans finance the fee:**
- Add to loan amount
- No out-of-pocket payment
- Small increase in monthly payment

**Example:**
- Home price: $350,000
- Funding fee: $7,525
- Total loan: $357,525
- Monthly difference: ~$50 more/month

### Paying at Closing

**Pay out-of-pocket:**
- Reduces total loan amount
- Lower monthly payment
- Costs cash upfront

### Seller Concessions

**Seller can pay your funding fee:**
- Part of up to 4% seller concessions allowed
- Negotiate as part of purchase

**Example:**
- Home price: $350,000
- 4% max concessions: $14,000
- Funding fee: $7,525
- Seller can cover fee + additional closing costs

## How to Get Your Exemption

### Before Applying

**If you have a VA disability rating:**
1. Obtain your VA Award Letter
2. Provide to lender at application
3. Exemption applied automatically

**If disability claim is pending:**
1. Notify lender of pending claim
2. May need to pay fee initially
3. Refund issued when rating granted retroactively

### Getting Retroactive Refund

**If you paid the fee but later receive disability rating retroactive to before closing:**

1. VA automatically refunds in most cases
2. Refund sent to loan servicer (applied to principal) or to you
3. Process can take 6-12 months after rating granted
4. Contact VA if refund doesn't arrive: 1-877-827-3702

**Required for refund:**
- Disability effective date must be before VA loan closing date
- Rating must be received after loan closed

### Documenting Your Exemption

**Acceptable documentation:**
- VA Award Letter showing disability rating
- eBenefits printout showing rating
- VA.gov disability status
- Letter from VA stating eligibility

## Common Questions About Exemptions

### Does 0% Rating Count?

**Yes!** Any service-connected rating, including 0%, exempts you from the funding fee IF it's a compensable rating or results from a hospitalization or treatment condition.

### What If I'm Pending a Disability Claim?

**You have options:**
1. Wait until rating is decided
2. Pay fee now, get refund later if granted retroactively
3. If VA has issued "proposed rating," may qualify now

### Does TDIU Qualify?

**Yes!** Total Disability Individual Unemployability (TDIU) at 100% rate definitely qualifies for exemption.

### What About Reservists?

**Same rules apply:**
- If you have VA disability rating = exempt
- Active duty call-up time may affect eligibility timing

### Can My Spouse's VA Disability Exempt Me?

**No.** Your own status determines exemption. However, if you're a surviving spouse receiving DIC, you're exempt.

## Strategies to Minimize Funding Fee

### 1. Apply for VA Disability Before Closing

If you have service-connected conditions, file your VA claim BEFORE closing on your home:
- Even 0% rating can exempt you
- Saves thousands of dollars
- Process takes 3-6 months typically

### 2. Make a Down Payment

Larger down payment = lower funding fee:
- 0% down: 2.15%
- 5% down: 1.5%
- 10% down: 1.25%

**On $350,000 home:**
- 0% down fee: $7,525
- 10% down fee: $3,937.50
- **Savings: $3,587.50**

### 3. Use IRRRL for Refinancing

If refinancing existing VA loan:
- IRRRL fee is only 0.5%
- vs. 2.15% for cash-out refinance
- Significant savings if you don't need cash

### 4. Negotiate Seller Concessions

Have seller pay your funding fee:
- Part of 4% allowed concessions
- Keeps cash in your pocket
- Competitive markets may limit this option

### 5. Time Your Purchase

If disability claim is pending:
- Consider waiting for decision
- Retroactive effective date may help

## Impact on Your Loan

### If Financed into Loan

**$350,000 loan + $7,525 funding fee = $357,525 total**

| Factor | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Base loan | $350,000 |
| Funding fee | $7,525 |
| Total loan | $357,525 |
| Interest rate | 6.5% |
| Monthly P&I | $2,259 |
| Extra monthly cost | ~$48 |
| Extra over 30 years | ~$17,280 |

**Still far less than PMI would cost.**

### Loan-to-Value Considerations

Financing the funding fee increases your LTV:
- Loan amount exceeds home value initially
- Not typically a problem for VA loans
- May affect refinancing options early on
