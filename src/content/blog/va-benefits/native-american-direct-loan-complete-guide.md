# Native American Direct Loan (NADL): VA Home Loan for Tribal Lands Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Direct home loan from VA for Native American veterans buying on federal trust land
- **Key benefit:** Zero down payment, low interest rate (currently 5.25%), no PMI
- **Who qualifies:** Native American veterans or those married to Native American, buying on tribal land
- **Why it exists:** Regular VA loans don't work on trust land—NADL fills this gap
- **Insider tip:** Your tribe must have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with VA for you to use NADL

## What Is the Native American Direct Loan?

The NADL program is a **direct loan** from the VA (not a guarantee like regular VA loans) specifically for:

- Regular VA loans are guaranteed (private lender makes loan, VA guarantees)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I have to live on the reservation?**
