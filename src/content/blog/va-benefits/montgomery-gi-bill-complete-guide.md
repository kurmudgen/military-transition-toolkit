# Montgomery GI Bill: When to Use vs Post-9/11 - Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** A monthly educational stipend of up to $2,185.05 paid directly to you (not the school)
- **Who qualifies:** Veterans who paid $1,200 during enlistment and served at least 2 years active duty
- **How much you get:** Fixed monthly payment regardless of school cost or location
- **Key difference:** You get the money—you choose how to spend it
- **Insider tip:** MGIB can be better for online programs, low-cost schools, or if you want maximum cash flexibility

## What Is the Montgomery GI Bill?

The Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty (MGIB-AD, Chapter 30) is the predecessor to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. While most veterans choose Post-9/11, Montgomery still has its place in certain situations.

Here's the key difference: Montgomery GI Bill pays YOU a flat monthly rate. Post-9/11 GI Bill pays your school directly for tuition, then pays you housing and books separately.

This means:
- **Montgomery:** You get $2,185.05/month. Pay your tuition, keep the rest.
- **Post-9/11:** VA pays your tuition. You get housing allowance (varies by location) and $1,000/year for books.

For some veterans, especially those attending cheaper schools or online programs, Montgomery can actually put more money in your pocket.

## Who Qualifies?

### Basic Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for MGIB-AD, you must have:

1. **Entered active duty after June 30, 1985** and before January 1, 2013
2. **Paid the $1,200 contribution** (usually $100/month deducted from your first 12 months of pay)
3. **Completed your service obligation**
4. **Received an honorable discharge**

### Service Requirements

| Entry Date | Minimum Active Duty Required |
|------------|------------------------------|
| After July 1, 1985 | 2 years (or 3 years for certain benefits) |
| Selected Reserve | 2 years active + 4 years Selected Reserve |

### Who Does NOT Qualify

- Those who declined MGIB enrollment
- Those discharged other than honorably
- Officers who received education debt reduction payments
- Those who used Senior ROTC scholarships
- Those who already exhausted benefits under another program

### Getting Your $1,200 Back

If you paid the $1,200 but never used MGIB:
- You can get it back if you switch to Post-9/11 GI Bill AND exhaust all 36 months
- The $1,200 is added to your final housing allowance payment
- You must use ALL 36 months to qualify for the refund

**Winner: Depends** - Post-9/11 slightly better, but you have less control

### Scenario 3: Expensive Private University

**Post-9/11 Benefits (with Yellow Ribbon):**
- Tuition: $60,000 fully covered via Yellow Ribbon
- Housing: $4,479/month × 9 months = $40,311
- Books: $1,000

- **Total: -$40,335 (major debt)**

**Winner: Post-9/11** - Not even close

### Scenario 4: Flight Training (Part 61)

For Part 61 flight training (non-college), Montgomery can be used; Post-9/11 cannot be used for Part 61 schools. See our flight training guide for details.

## How to Apply

- DD-214 (Member 4 copy)
- Evidence of $1,200 contribution
- Bank account information for direct deposit
- Education/training information

### Step 2: Apply for Benefits

**Online (VA.gov):**
1. Go to VA.gov/education/apply-for-education-benefits
2. Select VA Form 22-1990
3. Choose Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty (Chapter 30)
4. Complete and submit

**By Mail:**
1. Download VA Form 22-1990
2. Mail to: VA Regional Processing Office, P.O. Box 8888, Muskogee, OK 74402-8888

### Step 3: Verify Monthly

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Choosing MGIB Irrevocably
Once you elect Montgomery over Post-9/11, you cannot switch back. Consider carefully.

### 2. Forgetting Monthly Verification
Unlike Post-9/11, you must verify EVERY month. Missed verifications = missed payments.

### 3. Not Knowing About the Buy-Up
The $600 buy-up program must be done BEFORE discharge. Many veterans miss this opportunity.

### 4. Assuming Post-9/11 Is Always Better
Run the numbers for YOUR situation. Low-cost schools can favor Montgomery.

### 5. Losing the $1,200 Refund
If you switch to Post-9/11 but don't use all 36 months, you lose the $1,200 you paid into Montgomery.

### 6. Not Considering Flight Training
For Part 61 flight schools, Montgomery is sometimes the only option.

### 7. Ignoring Kicker Eligibility
If you have a kicker from your enlistment contract, Montgomery becomes even more attractive.

## Maximizing This Benefit

### Stack with Kickers
If you qualified for Army College Fund, Navy College Fund, or other kickers, your monthly payment can exceed $3,000/month.

### Use at Low-Cost Schools
The fixed payment structure means you keep more cash at cheaper schools.

### Combine with Other Aid
- Pell Grants (up to $7,395/year)
- State grants
- Private scholarships
- Employer tuition assistance

### Consider Part-Time Study
Montgomery payments adjust for part-time enrollment, but you may still come out ahead versus Post-9/11's prorated housing allowance.

### Flight Training Advantages
For certain aviation programs, Montgomery is the only option or provides more flexibility.

## How This Stacks With Other Benefits

### Can Use With:
- **Pell Grants:** Yes
- **State grants:** Yes
- **Private scholarships:** Yes
- **Federal work-study:** Yes
- **Employer tuition assistance:** Yes (up to cost of education)

### Cannot Use Simultaneously With:
- **Post-9/11 GI Bill:** Must choose one
- **VR&E (Chapter 31):** Cannot use both at same time

### Special Considerations:
- Montgomery payments count as income for FAFSA
- Payments may affect need-based aid eligibility
- Payments count as income for SNAP/food stamps

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Smart Choice at Community College

**Profile:** Navy veteran, 4 years service, attending local community college for Computer Science AS degree

- **Tuition:** $4,200/year
- **Montgomery payment:** $2,185.05/month × 9 months = $19,665.45
- **After tuition:** $15,465.45 remaining

If this veteran had chosen Post-9/11:
- Tuition: $4,200 paid to school
- Housing: $1,650/month × 9 = $14,850
- Books: $1,000
- **Total to veteran: $15,850**

**Difference:** Only $385 more with Post-9/11, but veteran had less cash flexibility with Montgomery

### Example 2: Online MBA Program

**Profile:** Air Force veteran, 6 years service, pursuing MBA online at Southern New Hampshire University

- **Tuition:** $18,810/year
- **Montgomery + Kicker:** $2,635.05/month × 12 = $31,620.60
- **After tuition:** $12,810.60 remaining

If Post-9/11:
- Tuition: $18,810 paid to school
- Housing: $1,054/month (online rate) × 12 = $12,648
- Books: $1,000
- **Total to veteran: $13,648**

**Winner:** Similar amounts, but Montgomery provides more cash flexibility

### Example 3: Flight Training (Part 61)

**Profile:** Army veteran wanting private pilot license through Part 61 school

- **Training cost:** $15,000
- **Montgomery:** Can be used for approved Part 61 schools
- **Post-9/11:** CANNOT be used for Part 61 schools (only Part 141)

**Winner:** Montgomery is the only option for Part 61
