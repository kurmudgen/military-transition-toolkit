# VA Cash-Out Refinance: Access Your Home Equity Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Refinance your mortgage (VA or conventional) and take cash from your home equity
- **Amount:** Up to 90% of your home's appraised value
- **Key benefit:** Access equity without selling, consolidate high-interest debt, fund major expenses
- **Funding fee:** 2.15% (first use) or 3.3% (subsequent) unless exempt
- **Insider tip:** VA cash-out can refinance a conventional loan INTO a VA loan while pulling equity

## What Is a VA Cash-Out Refinance?

A VA cash-out refinance allows you to:
1. Refinance your existing mortgage (VA or non-VA)
2. Take cash out based on your home equity
3. Use the cash for any purpose

**Unlike VA IRRRL (streamline refinance), cash-out:**
- Requires full underwriting
- Needs an appraisal
- Can increase your loan amount
- Can refinance non-VA loans into VA

**This is a powerful tool for veterans who have built home equity and need funds.**

## Who Qualifies?

### Eligibility Requirements

**VA loan eligibility:**
- Meet standard VA loan service requirements
- Have Certificate of Eligibility (COE)
- Discharge status other than dishonorable

**Property requirements:**
- Own and occupy the home as primary residence
- Property must meet VA Minimum Property Requirements
- Must have equity to borrow against

**Financial requirements:**
- Adequate income to support new loan amount
- Acceptable credit history (lender-specific)
- Meet debt-to-income requirements

### Current Loan Doesn't Matter

**You can cash-out refinance:**
- An existing VA loan
- A conventional mortgage
- An FHA loan
- Any other mortgage type

**This is a key benefit—you can convert any loan to VA while accessing equity.**

## How Much Can You Borrow?

### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Limits

**VA allows up to 90% LTV:**
- Home value: $400,000
- Maximum loan: $360,000 (90%)
- Existing mortgage: $250,000
- **Maximum cash: $110,000** (minus fees)

### Cash-Out Calculation

**Formula:**
```
New Loan Amount = Appraised Value × 90%
Cash Available = New Loan Amount - Existing Balance - Closing Costs
```

**Example:**
- Home appraised at: $450,000
- Max new loan (90%): $405,000
- Current mortgage: $280,000
- Closing costs: $12,000
- **Cash to you: $113,000**

### What Affects Your Amount

**Factors determining max cash-out:**
1. Current appraised value
2. Existing loan balance
3. Closing costs and funding fee
4. Your income/DTI ratio
5. Lender overlays (some go below 90%)

## What Can You Use the Cash For?

### Common Uses

**Debt consolidation:**
- Pay off high-interest credit cards
- Eliminate personal loans
- Clear car loans
- Consolidate student debt

**Home improvement:**
- Renovations
- Repairs
- Additions
- Energy efficiency upgrades

**Major expenses:**
- Medical bills
- Education costs
- Wedding expenses
- Emergency fund

**Investment:**

### No Restrictions

### When to Choose Cash-Out

**Cash-out is better when:**

**Estimate available cash:**
- Research comparable home sales
- Online valuation tools (estimate only)

**Consider your needs:**
- How much cash do you actually need?
- Can you afford higher monthly payment?

### Step 3: Shop Lenders

**Compare multiple lenders:**

- Timeline estimates

**Get at least 3 quotes.**

- Pay stubs (30 days)
- W-2s (2 years)
- Tax returns (2 years)
- Bank statements (2-3 months)
- Current mortgage statement

### Step 5: Appraisal

- Clean and declutter
- Make minor repairs
- Provide list of improvements
- Be available for appraiser questions

## Credit and Income Requirements

### Credit Score

**VA has no minimum, but lenders typically require:**
- 620 minimum (most lenders)
- 580-600 (some lenders)
- Higher scores = better rates

### Debt-to-Income Ratio

**VA guideline: 41% maximum**
- Can exceed with compensating factors
- Includes new mortgage payment
- Includes debts NOT being paid off

### Residual Income

**Must meet VA residual income requirements:**
- Income left after all expenses
- Varies by family size and region
- Unique to VA loans

### Employment

- Stable 2-year employment history
- Recent job changes OK with explanation
- Self-employed: 2 years typically required

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Shopping Multiple Lenders

Rates and fees vary significantly. Get multiple quotes.

### 2. Taking More Than Needed

Just because you CAN borrow 90% doesn't mean you should.

### 3. Ignoring the Funding Fee

2.15-3.3% is significant. Factor this into your decision.

### 4. Extending Loan Term

Refinancing 20-year balance to new 30-year costs more long-term.

### 5. Not Checking Exemption Status

If you have VA disability, you may be exempt from funding fee.

### 6. Using Cash Unwisely

Paying off high-interest debt = smart. Vacation = questionable.

### 7. Ignoring Break-Even Point

If you move soon after, you may not recoup costs.

### 8. Forgetting About Equity

After cash-out, you'll have less equity. Consider future plans.

## Strategies for Smart Cash-Out

### Debt Consolidation Strategy

**Ideal scenario:**
- High-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans)
- Cash-out at much lower rate
- Use savings to pay down principal faster

**Example:**
- $40,000 in credit cards at 20% average
- Current monthly payments: $800
- Cash-out at 6.5%: ~$250/month increase to mortgage
- **Monthly savings: $550**

### Home Improvement Strategy

**Use cash-out to increase home value:**
- Kitchen renovation: 75% ROI
- Bathroom addition: 54% ROI
- Deck addition: 65% ROI

**Borrow to improve, increase equity.**

### Emergency Fund Strategy

**Build financial cushion:**
- Take modest cash-out
- Establish 6-month emergency fund
- Low-cost access to capital

### Investment Strategy

**Consider carefully:**
- Cash-out at 6.5%
- Investment returns needed to beat
- Risk tolerance
- Alternative access to capital

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I do cash-out refinance on an investment property?**
A: No. VA loans require owner occupancy. Primary residence only.

**Q: How soon after buying can I cash-out refinance?**
A: Typically 6-12 months for full equity, but technically anytime with enough equity.

**Q: Can I cash-out refinance with poor credit?**
A: Possible with some lenders at 580+ score, but rates will be higher.

**Q: Is there a minimum cash-out amount?**
A: No VA minimum, but lenders may have minimums (often $10,000+).

**Q: Can I use cash-out for a down payment on another property?**
A: Yes. Cash is yours to use however you want.

**Q: What happens to my current escrow?**

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **Insufficient equity** - Home value lower than expected

3. **Credit issues** - Score too low or negative items
4. **Employment gaps** - Can't verify stable income
5. **Property issues** - Doesn't meet VA requirements

### How to Overcome

1. **Low equity:** Wait for appreciation, make improvements, pay down mortgage
2. **High DTI:** Pay down debts, increase income
3. **Credit:** Dispute errors, pay down balances, wait for improvement
4. **Employment:** Build 2-year history
5. **Property:** Make required repairs
