# Chapter 35 DEA: Education Benefits for Dependents Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Monthly education stipend for spouses and children of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled or died due to service
- **Who qualifies:** Dependents of veterans with 100% P&T disability, those who died in service, or those missing in action
- **How much:** Up to $1,456/month for full-time students (2024-2025 rates)
- **Duration:** Up to 36 months of benefits
- **Insider tip:** DEA is SEPARATE from transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill—some families qualify for both programs for different dependents

## What Is Chapter 35 DEA?

The Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program, also known as Chapter 35, provides education and training benefits to eligible dependents of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled due to service, or who died in service or from service-connected conditions.

Unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer, DEA is an automatic entitlement for qualifying dependents. Veterans don't need to transfer anything—if the veteran meets the criteria, dependents can apply directly.

**Key differences from Post-9/11 GI Bill:**
- No transfer required—automatic eligibility
- Flat monthly payment (not tuition + housing like Post-9/11)
- Paid directly to the student
- Based on veteran's disability status, not service time

## Who Qualifies?

### The Veteran Must Be (At Least One):

1. **Permanently and Totally Disabled** due to a service-connected disability (100% P&T rating)
2. **Died in active duty service**
3. **Died from a service-connected disability**
4. **Missing in action (MIA)** or captured/detained by a hostile foreign government
5. **Forcibly held by a foreign government** in the line of duty

### Eligible Dependents:

**Spouses:**
- Married to the qualifying veteran
- Eligibility period: 10-20 years depending on circumstances
- Can use benefits while married or if divorced (under certain conditions)

**Children:**
- Biological, adopted, or stepchildren
- Age 18-26 for most benefits
- Can begin at 18 (or when finishing high school, whichever is later)
- Can extend to 31 in some circumstances

### Step 2: Gather Documents

**Required documents:**

2. Sign in or create an account
3. Complete VA Form 22-5490 (Dependents' Application)
4. Submit electronically

**By Mail:**
1. Download VA Form 22-5490

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming P&T Means 100% Schedular
The veteran must have a 100% rating that is also marked "Permanent and Total" (P&T). A 100% schedular rating without P&T designation doesn't qualify dependents for DEA.

### 2. Missing the Age Window
Children must use benefits between ages 18-26. Starting late means fewer years to use all 36 months.

### 3. Confusing DEA with Transferred GI Bill
DEA (Chapter 35) is completely separate from Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer (Chapter 33). They have different eligibility rules and payment structures.

### 4. Not Considering Fry Scholarship
Children and spouses of service members who died on active duty after 9/10/2001 may qualify for the Fry Scholarship (100% Post-9/11 GI Bill), which typically pays more than DEA.

### 5. Forgetting Spouse Time Limits
Spouses have 10-20 year windows to use benefits. If you don't start in time, you may lose eligibility.

### 6. Overlooking Special Restorative Training
Dependents with disabilities may qualify for additional special training to overcome learning challenges.

### 7. Not Maximizing Work-Study
DEA recipients can also participate in VA Work-Study, earning additional money while in school.

## Maximizing DEA Benefits

### Stack with Other Aid

DEA doesn't affect eligibility for:
- Pell Grants (apply via FAFSA)
- State grants and scholarships
- Private scholarships
- Federal work-study
- VA work-study

### Consider Lower-Cost Schools

Since DEA pays a flat rate (not tuition), attending a lower-cost school means:
- Tuition is easily covered
- Money left over for living expenses
- Stretches benefits further

### Use All 36 Months

Plan your education to use the full 36 months:
- Undergraduate degree: ~36 months
- Add certifications or training
- Graduate school if time remains

### Work-Study Program

DEA recipients can earn extra money through VA work-study:
- Work at VA facilities or approved sites
- Earn minimum wage (tax-free up to limits)
- Part-time, flexible scheduling
- Great work experience

### Extension Possibilities

You may extend DEA beyond 36 months for:
- Certain professional programs (teaching, nursing)
- Special restorative training needs
- Make-up time for disability-related delays

## DEA vs. Fry Scholarship vs. Transferred GI Bill

| Feature | DEA (Chapter 35) | Fry Scholarship | Transferred Post-9/11 |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Eligibility | 100% P&T or death | Death on active duty post-9/11 | Transfer by veteran |
| Payment | Flat monthly | Tuition + housing + books | Tuition + housing + books |
| Monthly rate | $1,456 | BAH + tuition | BAH + tuition |
| Who applies | Dependent | Dependent | Veteran transfers |
| Requirements | Veteran status | Service-connected death | Service commitment |

**Generally, Fry Scholarship and Transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill pay more**, but DEA is automatically available to qualifying dependents without the veteran taking action.

## How DEA Stacks With Other Benefits

### Can Use With:
- **Pell Grants:** Yes
- **State grants:** Yes
- **Private scholarships:** Yes
- **Federal work-study:** Yes
- **VA work-study:** Yes
- **VA disability (if dependent has own):** Yes

### Cannot Use Simultaneously:
- **Transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill:** Not at the same time from same veteran
- **Fry Scholarship:** Cannot use both DEA and Fry

### Important Notes:
- DEA is taxable as income (unlike Post-9/11 GI Bill)
- May affect need-based financial aid calculations
- Does NOT include a housing allowance (flat rate only)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between DEA and Fry Scholarship?**
A: Fry Scholarship is specifically for dependents of service members who died on active duty after 9/10/2001 and provides full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (tuition, housing, books). DEA is for dependents of 100% P&T disabled or deceased veterans and pays a flat monthly rate.

**Q: Can I use DEA for online school?**
A: Yes, at the same rates as in-person. Unlike Post-9/11 GI Bill, there's no reduction for online enrollment.

**Q: Does my parent need to be 100% disabled for me to qualify?**
A: Yes, AND the rating must be marked "Permanent and Total" (P&T). A 100% rating without P&T doesn't qualify dependents.

**Q: Can I use DEA for graduate school?**
A: Yes, for any VA-approved graduate program.

**Q: What if I'm over 26?**
A: Extensions to age 31 are possible in certain circumstances, including military service or disability.

**Q: Is DEA taxable?**
A: Yes, DEA payments are taxable income, unlike Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.

**Q: Can both spouse and child use DEA?**
A: Yes, each eligible dependent has their own 36-month entitlement.

**Q: What if the veteran dies after I start using DEA?**
A: Your eligibility continues based on the original qualifying condition.

**Q: Can I switch from DEA to Fry Scholarship?**
A: If you qualify for Fry, you may switch. Consult with VA to understand the implications.

**Q: Does the veteran need to approve my DEA application?**
A: No, unlike transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill, DEA is an automatic entitlement for eligible dependents.

**Q: Can I use DEA for trade school?**
A: Yes, any VA-approved training program qualifies.

**Q: What happens to unused benefits if I turn 27?**
A: Standard eligibility ends at 26, but unused months may be extended under certain conditions.

**Q: Can divorced spouses use DEA?**
A: In some cases, yes, if still within the eligibility window and meeting other requirements.

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **Veteran not 100% P&T** - The disability rating doesn't include P&T designation
2. **Child over age 26** - Outside the standard eligibility window
3. **Spouse outside eligibility window** - More than 10-20 years from qualifying event
4. **Death not service-connected** - Veteran's death wasn't caused by service-connected conditions
5. **Relationship not verified** - Missing documentation proving relationship

### How to Appeal

1. **Request reconsideration** with additional documentation
2. **File Notice of Disagreement (NOD)** within one year
3. **Request Higher-Level Review** for faster decision
4. **Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)** for formal appeal

### Evidence That May Help

- Updated VA disability decision showing P&T
- Birth certificates, marriage certificates
- Dependency verification from DEERS
- Medical records linking death to service

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Child of 100% P&T Veteran

**Profile:** 19-year-old daughter of Army veteran with 100% P&T rating from combat injuries

**Using DEA for Bachelor's Degree:**
- 4 years of college = 36 months of benefits
- Full-time rate: $1,456/month × 36 = $52,416
- Plus Pell Grant: ~$7,395/year × 4 = $29,580
- **Total education funding: $81,996**

School chosen: State university with $12,000/year tuition
- DEA covers tuition with funds remaining for living expenses

### Example 2: Spouse of Deceased Veteran

**Profile:** Spouse of Marine killed in Afghanistan (2012)

**Options:**
1. DEA (Chapter 35): $1,456/month flat rate
2. Fry Scholarship: Full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits

**Better choice: Fry Scholarship** because it pays tuition directly plus housing allowance (typically $2,000-4,000/month based on location).

### Example 3: Multiple Dependents

**Profile:** Veteran with 100% P&T, spouse, and two children ages 17 and 20

**Available benefits:**
- Spouse: 36 months of DEA
- Child 1 (age 20): 36 months of DEA now
- Child 2 (age 17): 36 months of DEA starting at 18

**Total family education benefit: 108 months = $157,248**

Each dependent applies independently and receives their own entitlement.
