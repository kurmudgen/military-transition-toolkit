# VA IRRRL (Streamline Refinance): Lower Your Rate Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Simplified refinance for existing VA loans to lower interest rate or convert adjustable to fixed rate
- **Key benefit:** Minimal documentation, usually no appraisal, faster closing
- **Funding fee:** Only 0.5% (exempt if you have VA disability)
- **Requirement:** Must currently have a VA loan—can't convert non-VA loans
- **Insider tip:** IRRRL is the cheapest, fastest way to lower your VA loan payment if rates have dropped

## What Is VA IRRRL?

IRRRL stands for Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, also known as a "streamline refinance." It's designed to help veterans:
- Lower their interest rate
- Reduce monthly payments
- Convert adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgage
- With minimal paperwork and hassle

**Key features:**
- No appraisal required (usually)
- No credit underwriting package required (usually)
- No income verification required (usually)
- Only 0.5% funding fee
- Can be done quickly

**Limitation:** You must already have a VA loan. Cannot refinance conventional, FHA, or other loan types into IRRRL.

## Who Qualifies?

### Basic Requirements

**You must:**
1. Currently have a VA loan on the property
2. Be current on mortgage (no 30+ day lates in past 12 months)
3. Occupy the home OR have previously occupied it
4. Be refinancing your own VA loan

### Occupancy Rules

**Current or prior occupancy:**
- Must have lived in the home at some point
- Don't need to currently live there
- Can have converted to rental property

**This is unique to IRRRL—other VA loans require current occupancy.**

### Who Cannot Use IRRRL

- Veterans with conventional loans (use VA cash-out instead)
- Homes you've never occupied
- Properties being purchased (this is refinance only)
- Loans already at very low rates (must show "net tangible benefit")

## Net Tangible Benefit Requirement

### What It Means

VA requires that refinancing provides a "net tangible benefit" to the veteran:

**Automatic benefit if:**
- Rate drops at least 0.5%
- Converting from ARM to fixed rate

**Possible benefit if:**
- Shorter loan term
- Lower monthly payment
- Other demonstrable advantage

### What Lenders Check

**Lenders must certify:**
- Interest rate decreases (or converts to fixed)
- Combined rate (interest + mortgage insurance if any) decreases
- Monthly payment decreases OR loan term shortens

**Purpose:** Protect veterans from unnecessary refinancing fees.

### Recoupment Test

**Break-even calculation:**
- Total refinancing costs ÷ monthly savings = months to recoup
- Generally must recoup within 36 months
- Some flexibility allowed

**Example:**
- Refinancing costs: $3,000
- Monthly savings: $150
- Recoupment: 20 months ✓

## How Much Can You Save?

### Rate Reduction Savings

**Example: $300,000 loan balance**

| Current Rate | New Rate | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 7.5% | 6.5% | $200 | $2,400 |
| 7.0% | 6.0% | $190 | $2,280 |
| 6.5% | 5.5% | $180 | $2,160 |

### Total Savings Over Time

**$300,000 loan, 7.5% to 6.5%:**
- Monthly savings: $200
- 5-year savings: $12,000
- 10-year savings: $24,000
- 30-year savings: $72,000

### Funding Fee Impact

**Only 0.5% for IRRRL:**
- $300,000 loan × 0.5% = $1,500
- Compare to 2.15% for cash-out = $6,450

**If VA disability exempt: $0**

## IRRRL vs. Cash-Out Refinance

| Feature | IRRRL | Cash-Out |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Can refinance non-VA loan | No | Yes |
| Cash back | No | Yes (up to 90% LTV) |
| Appraisal required | Usually no | Yes |
| Income verification | Usually no | Yes |
| Credit package | Minimal | Full |
| Funding fee | 0.5% | 2.15-3.3% |
| Timeline | 2-4 weeks | 30-45 days |
| Occupancy | Current or prior | Must currently occupy |

### When to Choose IRRRL

- You have a VA loan already
- You just want lower rate
- You don't need cash
- You want quick, simple process

### When to Choose Cash-Out

- You have a non-VA loan
- You need equity access
- You want to consolidate debt
- You need significant cash

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Check If IRRRL Makes Sense

**Calculate your savings:**
- Current rate vs. available rates
- Monthly payment reduction
- Refinancing costs
- Break-even timeline

**Rule of thumb:** If rate drops 0.5%+ and you'll stay 2+ years, IRRRL likely makes sense.

### Step 2: Shop Lenders

**Compare multiple lenders:**
- Interest rates offered
- Closing costs
- Fees charged
- Timeline estimates
- Customer reviews

**Get at least 3 quotes—rates vary significantly.**

### Step 3: Apply

**Minimal documentation typically needed:**
- Proof of current VA loan
- Mortgage statement
- Basic personal information
- Sometimes income documentation

**What you usually DON'T need:**
- Full income verification
- Asset documentation
- Employment verification
- Appraisal

### Step 4: Processing

**Streamlined process:**
- Lender verifies current VA loan
- Checks payment history
- Calculates net tangible benefit
- Prepares closing documents

### Step 5: Closing

**Quick closing:**
- Sign documents
- Fund new loan
- Old loan paid off
- Start new payment schedule

## Timeline

| Step | Timeframe |
|------|-----------|
| Application | 1 day |
| Processing | 7-14 days |
| Closing | 1 day |
| **Total** | **2-4 weeks** |

**Much faster than traditional refinance.**

## Costs and Fees

### Funding Fee

**0.5% for all IRRRL:**
- $300,000 loan = $1,500
- Can be financed into loan
- Exempt with VA disability

### Closing Costs

**Typical IRRRL closing costs:**
- Origination fee: 0-1%
- Title fees: $200-500
- Recording fees: $50-200
- Other lender fees: Varies

**Many lenders offer "no closing cost" options:**
- Costs rolled into rate
- Slightly higher rate
- No out-of-pocket expense

### No-Cost IRRRL Strategy

**"No closing cost" refinance:**
- Lender credits cover all fees
- In exchange for slightly higher rate
- Still saves money if rate is lower than current

**Example:**
- Current rate: 7.5%
- IRRRL rate: 6.5%
- "No cost" rate: 6.75%
- **Still saving 0.75% with no out-of-pocket**

## Common Situations

### Scenario 1: Rate Drop

**Current situation:**
- VA loan at 7.5%
- Rates now at 6.5%
- 25 years remaining

**Action:** IRRRL to 6.5%
**Savings:** ~$200/month on $300,000

### Scenario 2: ARM to Fixed

**Current situation:**
- VA ARM currently at 5.5%
- Rate about to adjust up
- Want stability

**Action:** IRRRL to fixed rate (even if similar rate)
**Benefit:** Payment certainty

### Scenario 3: Recent Purchase

**Current situation:**
- Bought home 8 months ago at 7.25%
- Rates dropped to 6.25%

**Action:** IRRRL to new rate
**Note:** No minimum time requirement, but must show net tangible benefit

## What You Cannot Do with IRRRL

### No Cash Out

**IRRRL does not allow cash back:**
- Can only roll closing costs into loan
- Cannot tap equity
- Maximum loan = current balance + closing costs + funding fee

### No Loan Type Conversion

**Cannot use IRRRL to refinance:**
- Conventional loans
- FHA loans
- USDA loans
- Any non-VA mortgage

**Use VA Cash-Out Refinance for these.**

### No Major Loan Increase

**Loan amount limited to:**
- Current principal balance
- Plus allowable closing costs
- Plus funding fee
- Plus up to $6,000 for energy improvements

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Extending Your Loan Term

**Problem:** Refinancing 22-year remaining into new 30-year
**Impact:** More total interest paid
**Solution:** Consider 15- or 20-year term, or same remaining term

### 2. Serial Refinancing

**Problem:** Refinancing every time rates drop slightly
**Impact:** Fees eat into savings
**Solution:** Wait for meaningful rate drops (0.5%+)

### 3. Not Shopping Lenders

**Problem:** Taking first offer
**Impact:** Could have gotten better rate
**Solution:** Get 3+ quotes

### 4. Ignoring No-Cost Options

**Problem:** Paying $5,000 in closing costs
**Impact:** Takes years to recoup
**Solution:** Consider no-cost IRRRL if you might move

### 5. Targeting Too-Good Rates

**Problem:** Lender advertises unrealistic rate
**Impact:** Rate quote changes at closing
**Solution:** Get rate locks in writing

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need a new Certificate of Eligibility?**

A: Generally, must have made at least 6 payments on current loan.

**Q: Can I skip mortgage payments during refinance?**
A: No. Continue payments until new loan funds.

**Q: Will I need a new appraisal?**
A: Usually not. IRRRL typically waives appraisal requirement.

A: IRRRL doesn't require equity. You can refinance even if you owe more than home is worth.
