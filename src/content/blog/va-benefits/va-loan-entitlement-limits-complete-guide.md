# VA Loan Entitlement and Limits: How Much Can You Borrow Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **Full entitlement:** No loan limits—borrow as much as lender approves with $0 down
- **Key change (2020):** Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act removed loan limits for full entitlement
- **Partial entitlement:** County-based limits apply when you've used entitlement before
- **Can use multiple times:** Buy multiple homes over your lifetime
- **Insider tip:** Entitlement can be restored when you pay off/sell—plan strategically

## Understanding VA Entitlement

### What Is Entitlement?

Entitlement is the amount VA will guarantee on your loan. It's essentially VA's promise to the lender that they'll cover losses up to a certain amount if you default.

**Two types of entitlement:**
- **Basic entitlement:** $36,000
- **Bonus (second-tier) entitlement:** Additional amount based on county limits

### How VA Guarantee Works

VA guarantees 25% of the loan amount:
- $400,000 loan = $100,000 guarantee
- Lender protected for that amount
- Allows $0 down payment

**With full entitlement, VA guarantees 25% of any loan amount the lender approves.**

## Full Entitlement: No Limits

### Who Has Full Entitlement

**You have full entitlement if:**
- Never used VA loan benefit, OR
- Paid off previous VA loan AND sold the property, OR
- Paid off and restored entitlement (one-time allowance)

### What Full Entitlement Means

**Since 2020:**
- No loan limits for $0 down
- Borrow as much as lender approves
- Lender determines max based on your income

**Example:**
- Income supports $800,000 loan
- Full entitlement available
- Down payment: $0
- VA guarantees 25% = $200,000

### No County Limits

**With full entitlement:**
- Conforming loan limits DON'T apply
- Can exceed county limits with $0 down
- Only limited by what lender will approve

## Partial Entitlement: When Limits Apply

### Who Has Partial Entitlement

**Entitlement is partial if:**
- You have an existing VA loan
- You had a VA loan foreclosure (VA paid claim)
- You haven't restored entitlement after previous use

### How Partial Entitlement Works

**County-based limits apply:**
- Based on FHFA conforming loan limits
- Updated annually
- Vary by location

**2024 Conforming Loan Limits:**
- Standard: $766,550
- High-cost areas: Up to $1,149,825

### Calculating Available Entitlement

**Formula:**
```
Max entitlement = County limit × 25%
Available entitlement = Max entitlement - Used entitlement
Max $0-down loan = Available entitlement × 4
```

**Example:**
- County limit: $766,550
- Max entitlement: $191,637 (25%)
- Previously used: $50,000
- Available: $141,637
- Max $0-down loan: $566,548

### When You Need a Down Payment

**If loan exceeds available entitlement:**
- Down payment required for amount above limit
- 25% of the difference

**Example:**
- Want to buy: $600,000
- Max $0-down: $566,548
- Difference: $33,452
- Down payment: $8,363 (25% of difference)

## Using Entitlement Multiple Times

### Scenario 1: One Loan at a Time

**Sell first, buy second:**
1. Buy home with VA loan
2. Sell home and pay off loan
3. Entitlement automatically restored
4. Buy next home with full entitlement

**This is the cleanest approach—always full entitlement.**

### Scenario 2: Two Loans Simultaneously

**Keep first home, buy second:**
1. Buy home with VA loan ($300,000)
2. Keep as rental, PCS
3. Buy second home with remaining entitlement

**Entitlement calculations:**
- County limit: $766,550
- Max entitlement: $191,637
- Used on first loan: $75,000
- Available: $116,637
- Max $0-down second loan: $466,548

### Scenario 3: Restore and Buy Again

**One-time restoration:**
1. Pay off VA loan
2. Keep property (don't sell)
3. Request one-time restoration
4. Buy again with restored entitlement

**Only available once in lifetime.**

## Entitlement Restoration

### Automatic Restoration

**Entitlement automatically restores when:**
- Loan paid in full (sold, refinanced to conventional, paid off)
- Property transferred to new owner

**You don't need to do anything—VA updates automatically (though it may take a few weeks).**

### One-Time Restoration

**Special one-time allowance:**
- Paid off VA loan
- Still own the property
- Request restoration anyway

**Limitations:**
- Can only do this once
- Future loans will use remaining entitlement unless you sell

### Restoration After Default

**If VA paid a claim (foreclosure/short sale):**
- Entitlement reduced by claim amount
- Can restore by repaying VA
- Contact VA for amount owed

## Second-Tier Entitlement

### What It Is

Second-tier (bonus) entitlement is the additional guarantee above the basic $36,000, up to 25% of county loan limits.

### How It Applies

**In practice:**
- Basic entitlement: $36,000
- Bonus entitlement: County-specific amount
- Combined: Your total entitlement

**Most veterans don't need to track this separately—VA calculates automatically.**

### When It Matters

**Second-tier becomes important when:**
- You've used some entitlement
- Calculating remaining entitlement
- Buying in high-cost area with partial entitlement

## High-Cost Area Considerations

### 2024 High-Cost Area Limits

**Select high-cost county limits:**

| Area | Limit |
|------|-------|
| San Francisco, CA | $1,149,825 |
| Los Angeles, CA | $1,149,825 |
| New York City, NY | $1,149,825 |
| Washington, DC | $1,149,825 |
| Boston, MA | $862,500 |
| Seattle, WA | $977,500 |
| Denver, CO | $816,500 |

### Impact on Entitlement

**Higher limits = more entitlement:**
- SF limit: $1,149,825
- Max entitlement: $287,456
- More room for partial entitlement use

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario: PCS with Existing VA Loan

**Situation:**
- Own home in Virginia with VA loan ($400,000)
- PCSing to California
- Want to keep VA home as rental

**Options:**
1. **Sell Virginia home:** Restore full entitlement, buy in CA with $0 down
2. **Keep Virginia home:** Use remaining entitlement, may need down payment in CA
3. **Refinance Virginia to conventional:** Restore entitlement, keep property, buy in CA with $0 down

**Best choice depends on:**
- Rental income potential
- Equity in Virginia home
- California purchase price
- Down payment availability

### Scenario: Investment Strategy

**Using VA for wealth building:**
1. Buy home #1 with VA (live there)
2. Convert to rental when you move
3. Buy home #2 with remaining entitlement
4. Convert to rental
5. Refinance one to conventional, restore entitlement
6. Buy home #3
7. Repeat

**VA loan can help build rental portfolio.**

### Scenario: Upgrading Homes

**Trade-up strategy:**
1. Buy starter home ($300,000)
2. Build equity (5-10 years)
3. Sell, restore entitlement
4. Buy larger home ($500,000)
5. Full entitlement available

**VA benefit grows with you.**

## Common Questions

### Can I Have Two VA Loans at Once?

**Yes!**
- As long as you have remaining entitlement
- Must occupy one as primary residence (or have previously occupied)
- Second can be rental

### Does My Spouse's Entitlement Count?

**If both are veterans:**
- Can combine entitlement
- May get larger loan
- Each must qualify individually

**If only one is veteran:**
- Use veteran's entitlement
- Spouse can be co-borrower but doesn't add entitlement

### What If I've Had a Foreclosure?

**VA foreclosure:**
- Entitlement reduced by VA's loss
- Can restore by repaying VA
- May still have remaining entitlement

**Non-VA foreclosure:**
- Doesn't affect VA entitlement
- Credit impacts may affect loan approval

### Can I Use VA Loan for Investment Property?

**Not directly:**
- VA loans require occupancy as primary residence
- But can convert to rental later
- Then buy another as primary with remaining entitlement

### What Happens When I Die?

**Entitlement is not inherited:**
- Surviving spouse gets loan assumption rights
- May qualify for surviving spouse COE
- Children don't inherit entitlement

## Calculating Your Entitlement

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**1. Find your county loan limit:**
Check VA.gov for current year

**2. Calculate maximum entitlement:**
County limit × 25%

**3. Subtract used entitlement:**
Check your COE for used amount

**4. Calculate max $0-down loan:**
Available entitlement × 4

**5. Determine if down payment needed:**
If purchase price > max $0-down, calculate 25% of difference

### Example Calculation

**Situation:**
- County limit: $766,550
- Current VA loan: $350,000
- Want to buy: $450,000

**Calculation:**
1. Max entitlement: $766,550 × 25% = $191,637
2. Used entitlement: $350,000 × 25% = $87,500
3. Available: $191,637 - $87,500 = $104,137
4. Max $0-down: $104,137 × 4 = $416,548
5. Difference: $450,000 - $416,548 = $33,452
6. Down payment: $33,452 × 25% = **$8,363**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is there a maximum I can borrow with a VA loan?**
A: With full entitlement, no. Lender determines max based on income.

**Q: Do loan limits apply to everyone?**
A: Only to those with partial entitlement (existing VA loan or unrestored usage).

**Q: How do I check my remaining entitlement?**
A: Request COE online, through lender, or by mail.

**Q: Can limits go down?**
A: They can, but VA protects existing loans. Annual changes affect new loans.

**Q: What if I need more than my entitlement allows?**
A: Make a down payment for the amount above your entitlement limit.

**Q: Does IRRRL (streamline refinance) use additional entitlement?**
A: No. IRRRL uses same entitlement as original loan.

**Q: Can I transfer entitlement to someone else?**
A: No. Entitlement is individual and non-transferable.

**Q: Do I lose entitlement when I turn 65?**
A: No. Entitlement doesn't expire.

**Q: What if I've used entitlement in multiple counties?**
A: VA tracks total usage regardless of location.

**Q: Does rental income count toward qualification?**
A: Yes. Documented rental income can help you qualify for larger loan.
