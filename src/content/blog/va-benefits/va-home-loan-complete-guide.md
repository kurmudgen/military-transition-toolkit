# VA Home Loan: Complete First-Time Buyer Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Government-backed mortgage program exclusively for veterans, service members, and eligible surviving spouses
- **Key benefit:** $0 down payment with no private mortgage insurance (PMI)
- **Savings:** $200-400/month compared to conventional mortgages with similar loan amounts
- **Who qualifies:** Veterans, active duty, Guard/Reserve with sufficient service, surviving spouses
- **Insider tip:** VA loans often have LOWER interest rates than conventional mortgages—don't assume they're harder to get

## What Is a VA Home Loan?

A VA home loan is a mortgage guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA doesn't lend money directly—private lenders (banks, credit unions, mortgage companies) make the loans, and VA guarantees a portion, reducing lender risk.

**This guarantee allows lenders to offer:**
- No down payment required
- No private mortgage insurance (PMI)
- Competitive interest rates
- Flexible credit requirements
- Limited closing costs

**It's one of the most powerful financial benefits earned through military service.**

| Interest Rates | Often lower | Market rate |
| Credit Requirements | Flexible | Stricter |

| **Monthly Savings** | - | **$150-250** |
| **5-Year PMI Savings** | - | **$9,000-15,000** |

## VA Loan Limits and Entitlement

### Full Entitlement (No Down Payment Limits)

If you've never used VA loan benefit OR have paid off previous VA loan:
- **No loan limit for $0 down**
- Borrow as much as lender approves
- Full entitlement restored when previous loan paid off

### Reduced Entitlement

If you have an existing VA loan or defaulted previously:
- Loan limits based on remaining entitlement
- May need down payment above certain amount
- Can restore entitlement by paying off/selling previous home

### How Entitlement Works

**Basic entitlement:** $36,000
**Bonus entitlement:** Additional amount (varies by county)

**Total guarantee:** Up to 25% of loan amount

**Example:** In a county with $726,200 limit:
- Full entitlement = $181,550 guarantee
- This supports $726,200 loan at $0 down

### Second-Tier Entitlement

You can use VA loan while keeping another VA loan:
- Remaining entitlement determines new loan limit
- May require down payment
- Common for PCS moves or investment

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

**Get your Certificate of Eligibility (COE):**
- eBenefits or VA.gov (instant for many)
- Through lender (most can pull it)
- By mail (VA Form 26-1880)

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approved

**Find a VA-experienced lender:**

- Checks Minimum Property Requirements
- Must meet both value and condition standards

**If appraisal is low:**

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Shopping Multiple Lenders

VA loan rates and fees vary significantly. Get quotes from at least 3 lenders.

### 2. Assuming You Can't Qualify

VA loans have more flexible requirements than conventional. Don't self-disqualify.

### 3. Ignoring the Funding Fee Exemption

If you have ANY VA disability rating, you're exempt from the funding fee (saves thousands).

### 4. Skipping Pre-Approval

Pre-approval shows sellers you're serious and ready. Essential in competitive markets.

### 5. Not Using VA-Experienced Professionals

Choose lenders and agents who understand VA loan nuances.

### 6. Overlooking Seller Concessions

VA allows 4% seller concessions—use this to reduce out-of-pocket costs.

### 7. Waiting Until Discharge

Active duty can use VA loans. Don't wait until you separate.

### 8. Not Understanding Occupancy Rules

Must be primary residence. Plan accordingly.

## If You're Denied

5. **Appraisal issues** - Value or condition problems

### How to Overcome

1. **Credit issues:** Work with credit counselor, dispute errors, wait for improvements
2. **Income issues:** Build 2-year history, add co-borrower
3. **Property issues:** Request seller repairs, find different property
4. **Appraisal issues:** Request reconsideration with comps, renegotiate
