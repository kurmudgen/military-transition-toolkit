# Vocational Rehab (VR&E Chapter 31): Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Comprehensive employment program for veterans with service-connected disabilities—covers education, training, job placement, and more
- **Who qualifies:** Veterans with at least 10% service-connected disability rating (20% for some tracks) and an employment barrier
- **Why it's better than GI Bill:** Covers 100% of education costs with no cap, plus supplies, tools, and subsistence allowance—and doesn't count against your GI Bill
- **Key requirement:** Must demonstrate "serious employment handicap" caused by disability
- **Insider tip:** VR&E can pay for things GI Bill won't: laptops, professional licenses, suits, resume services, and even business startup costs

## What Is VR&E (Chapter 31)?

Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E), also known as Chapter 31 or the VetSuccess program, is one of the most underutilized VA benefits. It goes far beyond education—it's a complete career rehabilitation program.

**VR&E can provide:**
- College education (100% paid, no caps)
- Vocational training and certifications
- Career counseling and planning
- Job placement assistance
- Resume writing and interview prep
- Tools, equipment, and supplies
- Monthly subsistence allowance
- Self-employment assistance
- Long-term services for severely disabled veterans

**Unlike the GI Bill:**
- No tuition cap (private schools fully covered)
- Supplies and equipment provided
- Doesn't use up your GI Bill months
- Can be used alongside some disability programs

## Who Qualifies?

### Basic Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for VR&E, you must:

1. **Have a service-connected disability rating** of at least 10%
2. **Have an employment barrier** due to your service-connected disability
3. **Not have exhausted your basic 12-year eligibility period** (with exceptions)
4. **Be discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable**

### What Is an "Employment Handicap"?

An employment handicap means your service-connected disability creates an impairment to employment. This is evaluated individually and considers:

- How your disability affects your ability to prepare for, obtain, or maintain suitable employment
- Your current skills and education
- The labor market in your area
- Your interests and aptitudes

**Important:** You don't need to be unemployed. Even if you're working, you may qualify if your disability limits your career options or advancement.

### Entitlement Determination

After applying, a VR&E counselor evaluates your case:

| Finding | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| Employment Handicap | Entitled to evaluation and planning services |
| Serious Employment Handicap | Entitled to full VR&E services |
| Not entitled | Can appeal or reapply if circumstances change |

### Who Qualifies for Each Track

- 10% minimum rating
- Employment handicap

**Rapid Access to Employment Track:** Job-ready veterans

- Serious employment handicap often required

**Employment Through Long-Term Services Track:** Extensive training needed
- 20% minimum rating (usually)

## VR&E vs. GI Bill: Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | VR&E (Chapter 31) | Post-9/11 GI Bill |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tuition coverage | 100%, no cap | Capped at ~$28,938/year for private |
| Yellow Ribbon needed | No | Yes (for expensive schools) |
| Monthly allowance | Subsistence allowance | Housing allowance (BAH) |
| Books/supplies | Provided by VA | $1,000/year stipend |
| Laptop/computer | Can be provided | Not covered |
| Certifications | Covered | May use benefit months |
| Professional licenses | Covered | May use benefit months |
| Job placement | Included | Not included |
| Resume services | Included | Not included |

**Key advantage:** VR&E does NOT use your GI Bill entitlement. You can use VR&E first, then still have GI Bill available for future use.

## How Much Will You Get?

### Subsistence Allowance

VR&E provides a monthly subsistence allowance during training:

| Training Type | Full-Time Rate (2024-2025) |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Institution (no dependents) | $784.02 |
| Institution (1 dependent) | $971.65 |
| Institution (2 dependents) | $1,149.90 |
| Each additional dependent | +$89.00 |
| On-job training/apprenticeship | Lower rates |

**Note:** If you're receiving Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance, you may receive that instead (usually higher).

### Supplies and Equipment

VR&E can provide:
- Laptops/computers
- Software
- Tools for trade
- Uniforms
- Books and supplies
- Professional equipment
- Adaptive technology

**No specific cap**—based on what's needed for your vocational goal.

### Other Covered Expenses

- Tutoring (if needed)
- Interpreter services
- Reader services
- Note-taking assistance
- Transportation (in some cases)
- Childcare (in some cases)
- Professional licensing exam fees
- Work clothing/interview attire

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Verify Disability Rating

Ensure you have a current service-connected disability rating:
- Log into VA.gov
- Check your disability rating
- Must be at least 10%

### Step 2: Apply Online

**Preferred method:**
1. Go to VA.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply
2. Sign in with your ID.me, Login.gov, or DS Logon
3. Complete VA Form 28-1900 (Application for Vocational Rehabilitation)
4. Submit

**By mail:**
1. Download VA Form 28-1900
2. Mail to your regional VA office

### Step 3: Orientation Appointment

After applying:
1. VA schedules an orientation (virtual or in-person)
2. Learn about VR&E services
3. Complete initial paperwork
4. Schedule counselor appointment

### Step 4: Meet with VR&E Counselor

The counselor will:
1. Review your application
2. Discuss your disabilities and limitations
3. Explore your interests and goals
4. Determine if you have an employment handicap
5. Decide on entitlement

### Step 5: Develop Rehabilitation Plan

If entitled, you'll create an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP):
1. Define your vocational goal
2. Outline services needed
3. Set milestones and timeline
4. Both you and counselor sign
5. Services begin

## Timeline

| Step | Timeframe |
|------|-----------|
| Apply | Same day (online) |
| Orientation scheduling | 1-4 weeks |
| Orientation | 1-2 hours |
| Counselor meeting | 1-3 weeks after orientation |
| Entitlement decision | At counselor meeting |
| Plan development | 1-4 weeks |
| Services begin | Upon plan approval |

**Total:** 4-8 weeks from application to starting services

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Applying Because "I Can Work"
You don't need to be unemployed or unable to work. VR&E is for career ADVANCEMENT and overcoming barriers.

### 2. Thinking GI Bill Is Better
VR&E often provides more value: no tuition cap, free supplies, job placement. Compare before choosing.

### 3. Not Being Specific About Goals
Have a clear career goal before meeting your counselor. Vague goals = vague plans.

### 4. Hiding Disability Impacts
Be honest about how your disability affects your work capacity. This determines your entitlement level.

### 5. Missing Appointments
VR&E requires engagement. Missing appointments can result in case closure.

### 6. Not Advocating for Yourself
If you need something (laptop, supplies, specific training), ask. Counselors can only approve what you request.

### 7. Ignoring the 12-Year Limit
Basic eligibility is 12 years from discharge. Don't wait too long (exceptions exist for serious employment handicaps).

### 8. Not Understanding You Can Switch
You can switch from GI Bill to VR&E (but not back). If you start with GI Bill and realize VR&E is better, you can change.

## Maximizing VR&E Benefits

### Get Everything You Need

VR&E can provide (if justified and approved):
- High-end laptop for school
- Professional software (Adobe, Microsoft, specialized programs)
- Tools for your trade
- Interview suits/professional attire

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between VR&E and GI Bill?**
A: VR&E is a career rehabilitation program with no tuition cap, free supplies, and job placement. GI Bill is purely an education benefit with caps and limited months.

2. **Insufficient disability rating** - Below 10%
3. **Outside eligibility period** - Beyond 12 years from discharge
4. **Unrealistic vocational goal** - Goal doesn't match abilities/market
5. **Already employable** - No barrier exists

### How to Appeal

1. **Request reconsideration** with your counselor
2. **Provide additional evidence** of employment barriers
3. **File Notice of Disagreement** within one year
4. **Request Higher-Level Review**
5. **Appeal to Board of Veterans Appeals**
