# VA Math: How Combined Ratings Actually Work Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **Key concept:** VA doesn't add ratings—it combines them using "remaining efficiency"
- **Example:** 50% + 30% ≠ 80%. It equals 65% (rounded from 65%)
- **Why it matters:** Understanding VA math helps you predict your rating and plan claims
- **Bilateral factor:** Extra 10% on top of combined value for paired limb/organ conditions
- **Insider tip:** Order matters for rounding—claim strategically to maximize your combined rating

## Why 50% + 30% ≠ 80%

The VA uses a system called "combined ratings" rather than simple addition. Here's why:

**The Logic:**
- A 50% disability means you're 50% disabled and 50% "efficient"
- Additional disabilities reduce your remaining efficiency, not your total health
- You can never be more than 100% disabled

**In Practice:**
- Start with your highest rating (let's say 50%)
- The next rating (30%) is applied to your REMAINING 50% efficiency
- 30% of 50% = 15%
- Combined: 50% + 15% = 65%

## The VA Math Formula

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **List all ratings from highest to lowest**
2. **Start with 100 (representing 100% healthy)**
3. **Subtract the first rating**
4. **Multiply remaining percentage by (1 - next rating)**
5. **Repeat for each rating**
6. **Subtract final result from 100**
7. **Round to nearest 10%**

### Formula

```
Combined = 100 - [(100 - A) × (100 - B) × (100 - C)...]
```

Then round to nearest 10%.

### Example 1: Two Ratings (50% + 30%)

Step 1: Start with 100% healthy
Step 2: Apply 50%: 100 - 50 = 50% remaining efficiency
Step 3: Apply 30%: 50 × (1 - 0.30) = 50 × 0.70 = 35% remaining
Step 4: Combined: 100 - 35 = 65%
Step 5: Round: 65% → **70%** (or 60% depending on .5 rule)

**Actually, 65% rounds to 70%** (because .5 rounds up).

### Example 2: Three Ratings (50% + 40% + 20%)

Step 1: Start with 100
Step 2: Apply 50%: 100 - 50 = 50 remaining
Step 3: Apply 40%: 50 × 0.60 = 30 remaining
Step 4: Apply 20%: 30 × 0.80 = 24 remaining
Step 5: Combined: 100 - 24 = 76%
Step 6: Round: 76% → **80%**

## The Combined Ratings Table

VA provides an official table. Here are common combinations:

| First Rating | Second Rating | Combined (Before Rounding) | Final Rating |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 10% | 10% | 19% | 20% |
| 20% | 20% | 36% | 40% |
| 30% | 30% | 51% | 50% |
| 40% | 40% | 64% | 60% |
| 50% | 50% | 75% | 80% |
| 50% | 30% | 65% | 70% |
| 60% | 30% | 72% | 70% |
| 70% | 30% | 79% | 80% |
| 70% | 50% | 85% | 90% |
| 80% | 20% | 84% | 80% |
| 90% | 10% | 91% | 90% |

## The Rounding Rule

VA rounds to the nearest 10%:

- 0-4% → rounds down
- 5-9% → rounds up

**Examples:**
- 54% → 50%
- 55% → 60%
- 74% → 70%
- 75% → 80%
- 94% → 90%
- 95% → 100%

## The Bilateral Factor

### What It Is

When you have disabilities affecting BOTH arms, BOTH legs, or BOTH ears (paired organs/limbs), VA adds a 10% "bilateral factor" bonus.

### How It Works

1. **Combine** all bilateral conditions first
2. **Add 10%** of that combined value
3. **Then combine** with non-bilateral conditions

### Example: Bilateral Knee Problems

**Conditions:**
- Right knee: 30%
- Left knee: 20%
- Back: 40%

**Without bilateral factor:**
- Combine 40% + 30% + 20% = 66% → 70%

**With bilateral factor:**
1. Combine bilateral (knees): 30% + 20% = 44%
2. Add bilateral factor: 44% × 0.10 = 4.4
3. Bilateral total: 44% + 4.4% = 48.4%
4. Combine with back: 48.4% + 40% = 69.04%
5. Round: 69.04% → **70%**

*In this case, same result. But bilateral factor can make a difference at thresholds.*

### What Counts as Bilateral

**Bilateral conditions:**
- Both knees
- Both hips
- Both shoulders
- Both arms
- Both legs
- Both ears (hearing loss)
- Both eyes (vision)
- Both feet

**NOT bilateral:**
- One arm + one leg (different limb types)
- Right hand + right foot (same side, different limbs)

## Strategic Claiming

### Order of Ratings

The order doesn't change the final combined value mathematically, but...

**Rounding strategy:**
Sometimes splitting claims or timing can affect which ratings combine to push you over thresholds.

### Threshold Thinking

Key compensation thresholds:
- 30%: Dependent payments begin
- 50%: Significant pay increase
- 60%/70%: TDIU eligibility
- 100%: Maximum standard rating

**If you're at 68%, getting to 70% means:**
- Higher monthly payment
- TDIU eligibility if you can't work

### Claiming All Conditions

File for EVERYTHING service-connected:
- Multiple 10% ratings add up
- Bilateral factor can help
- Secondary conditions count

**Example:**
Four 10% ratings:
- 10% + 10% = 19%
- 19% + 10% = 27.1%
- 27.1% + 10% = 34.4%
- Round: **30%**

Better than not claiming them!

## Common Questions About VA Math

### Why Can't I Get to 100%?

Mathematically, you can only reach 100% combined by:
- Single 100% rating
- Combination that reaches 95%+ (rounds to 100%)

**Example to reach 100%:**
- 90% + 60% = 96% → 100%
- 80% + 80% = 96% → 100%
- 70% + 70% + 60% = 96.4% → 100%

### What About 0% Ratings?

0% ratings don't add to combined value but:
- Establish service connection
- Can increase if condition worsens
- May qualify for SMC-K (loss of creative organ, etc.)

### What If I Have 100% + Other Ratings?

Once you have 100%:
- Additional ratings don't increase percentage
- BUT they may qualify for SMC-S (housebound)
- 100% + separate 60% = SMC-S

### Pyramiding Rule

VA cannot rate the same symptoms twice:
- Can't get ratings for same manifestation
- Different conditions can overlap functionally
- One rating may subsume another

**Example:**
- Can't get separate ratings for "knee pain" and "knee arthritis" if same symptoms
- But can get knee + back if different joints

## Calculating Your Own Rating

### Step-by-Step Calculator Method

1. List all ratings: 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%
2. Order highest to lowest
3. Calculate:
   - 50% applied: 100 - 50 = 50 remaining
   - 30% of 50: 50 × 0.70 = 35 remaining
   - 20% of 35: 35 × 0.80 = 28 remaining
   - 10% of 28: 28 × 0.90 = 25.2 remaining
4. Combined: 100 - 25.2 = 74.8%
5. Round: **70%**

### Online Calculators

Use VA math calculators:
- VA.gov doesn't provide one
- Many VSOs and law firms have them
- Search "VA combined rating calculator"

### DIY Spreadsheet

Create a spreadsheet:
- Column A: Ratings
- Column B: Remaining efficiency
- Formula: =B[previous] × (1 - A[current]/100)
- Final: =100 - B[last]

## Bilateral Factor Deep Dive

### When It Matters Most

Bilateral factor helps most when:
- Bilateral conditions are moderate (20-40%)
- On the edge of a threshold
- Multiple paired conditions

### Example Where Bilateral Matters

**Conditions:**
- Right knee: 20%
- Left knee: 20%
- Right shoulder: 10%
- PTSD: 50%

**Without bilateral factor for knees:**
- 50% + 20% + 20% + 10% = 69.4% → 70%

**With bilateral factor:**
1. Bilateral knees: 20% + 20% = 36%
2. Bilateral factor: 36% × 0.10 = 3.6%
3. Bilateral total: 39.6%
4. Combine: 50% + 39.6% + 10% = 72.3%
5. Round: **70%**

Same result here, but the 72.3% gives more buffer.

### Multiple Bilateral Sets

If you have both arms AND both legs affected:
- Each bilateral pair gets its own 10% factor
- Then combine the pairs

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why doesn't VA just add ratings?**
A: The system assumes you can't lose more than 100% of function. Each additional disability affects only remaining function.

**Q: Does the bilateral factor apply to all paired organs?**
A: Yes—arms, legs, eyes, ears, kidneys, etc.

**Q: What if I'm at 94%?**
A: 94% rounds to 90%. You'd need to reach 95% to round to 100%.

**Q: Can I ever be rated over 100%?**
A: Not for standard compensation. But SMC provides payments above 100%.

**Q: How do 0% ratings affect combined rating?**
A: They don't add to the percentage but establish service connection for future increases.

**Q: What's the easiest path to 100%?**
A: Single 100% rating (PTSD, TBI, etc.) or TDIU if unemployable.

**Q: Does mental health combine differently?**
A: No, same VA math. But mental health conditions are rated 0-100% on their own scale.

**Q: What if VA calculated my rating wrong?**
A: Request review. VA math errors do happen.

## If Your Rating Seems Wrong

### Check the Math

1. List all your individual ratings
2. Calculate combined rating yourself
3. Compare to VA's decision

### Common Errors

- Missing bilateral factor
- Rounding mistakes
- Overlooked conditions
- Pyramiding issues

### Request Review

If you believe there's an error:
1. File Higher-Level Review (HLR)
2. Point to specific calculation error
3. No new evidence needed for math errors

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Low Ratings

**Ratings:** 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%

**Calculation:**
- 100 → 90 (10%) → 81 (10%) → 72.9 (10%) → 65.6 (10%) → 59.0 (10%)
- Combined: 100 - 59 = 41%
- **Round: 40%**

### Example 2: Reaching 100%

**Ratings:** 70%, 50%, 30%, 20%

**Calculation:**
- 100 → 30 (70%) → 15 (50%) → 10.5 (30%) → 8.4 (20%)
- Combined: 100 - 8.4 = 91.6%
- **Round: 90%**

Almost there! Would need another 10%+ to reach 95% → 100%.

### Example 3: Bilateral Impact

**Ratings:** Right leg 40%, Left leg 30%, Back 50%

**Bilateral legs:**
- 40% + 30% = 58%
- Bilateral factor: 58% × 10% = 5.8%
- Bilateral total: 63.8%

**Combined with back:**
- 63.8% + 50% = 81.9%
- **Round: 80%**

**Without bilateral factor:**
- 50% + 40% + 30% = 79%
- **Round: 80%**

Same result, but bilateral factor gave us 81.9% vs. 79% before rounding.
