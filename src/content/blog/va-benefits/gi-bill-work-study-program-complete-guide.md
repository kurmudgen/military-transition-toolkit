## Common Mistakes

### 1. Applying Too Late
Work-study positions are limited. Apply well before the semester starts.

### 2. Dropping Below 3/4 Time
If your enrollment drops below 3/4 time, you lose work-study eligibility. Plan your course load carefully.

### 3. Not Tracking Hours
You must track and report hours accurately. Inaccurate reporting can result in overpayment and debt.

### 4. Expecting High Wages
Work-study pays minimum wage. It's meant to supplement GI Bill benefits, not replace a full income.

### 5. Ignoring Advance Payment Option
The advance payment can help with start-of-semester expenses. Don't overlook it.

### 6. Not Networking
Work-study at VA facilities provides excellent networking opportunities. Build relationships—they can lead to permanent employment.

### 7. Working Unauthorized Hours
Only work approved hours at approved locations. Unauthorized work won't be paid.

### 8. Missing Contract Renewals
Contracts are typically semester-based. Renew each term to continue working.
