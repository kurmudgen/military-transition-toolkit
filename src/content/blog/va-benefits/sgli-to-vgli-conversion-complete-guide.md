# SGLI to VGLI Conversion: Life Insurance After Military Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Converting military life insurance (SGLI) to veteran coverage (VGLI) after separation
- **Deadline:** 240 days (8 months) from separation for automatic approval
- **Key decision:** VGLI is guaranteed issue but expensive—private insurance is often cheaper
- **Coverage:** Up to $500,000 (same as SGLI amount at separation)
- **Insider tip:** Apply for private insurance BEFORE separation while you're still healthy—use VGLI as backup

## Understanding SGLI vs. VGLI

### SGLI (Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance)

**While serving:**
- Up to $500,000 coverage
- Very cheap (~$29/month for max coverage)
- Automatic coverage
- Ends 120 days after separation

### VGLI (Veterans' Group Life Insurance)

**After service:**
- Convert from SGLI
- Same coverage amount (up to $500,000)
- Rates increase with age
- Guaranteed acceptance if within deadline

### SGLI Coverage Extension

**120-Day Free Coverage:**
- SGLI continues FREE for 120 days after separation
- Full coverage during transition
- Time to arrange replacement coverage

## Who Should Consider VGLI?

### VGLI Makes Sense If:

**Health issues:**
- Conditions that make private insurance difficult
- Service-connected disabilities
- Would be declined by private insurers
- Pre-existing conditions

**Timing issues:**
- Missed private insurance deadlines
- Need immediate coverage
- Transitioning job with benefits gap

**Convenience:**
- Simple, guaranteed approval
- No medical exam (within 240 days)
- Continuous coverage

### VGLI May NOT Be Best If:

**You're healthy:**
- Private insurance likely cheaper
- Can pass medical underwriting
- Long-term savings significant

**You're young:**
- Age-based rates hurt long-term
- Better rates elsewhere
- Time to shop alternatives

## VGLI vs. Private Insurance

### When VGLI Wins

**VGLI advantages:**
- Guaranteed acceptance (within 240 days)
- No medical exam
- No health questions
- Portable (doesn't depend on employer)
- VA backing

**Best for:**
- Veterans with health issues
- Those who can't qualify for private
- Immediate coverage needs
- Bridge coverage while shopping

### When Private Wins

**Private insurance advantages:**
- Lower rates (if healthy)
- Rates can be locked
- More coverage options
- Riders and additional benefits
- Long-term savings

**Best for:**
- Healthy veterans
- Those who can pass underwriting
- Long-term coverage needs
- Cost-conscious buyers

### Strategy: Use Both

**Smart approach:**
1. Apply for VGLI within 240 days (guaranteed)
2. Simultaneously apply for private insurance
3. If approved for private at better rate, cancel VGLI
4. If declined for private, keep VGLI

## Other VA Life Insurance Options

### S-DVI (Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance)

**Who qualifies:**
- Veterans with service-connected disability
- Within 2 years of VA rating notification

**Coverage:**
- Up to $10,000
- Additional $30,000 if totally disabled
- Much lower cost than VGLI

### VALife (Veterans Affairs Life Insurance)

**Who qualifies:**
- Veterans aged 80 or under
- With service-connected disability rating
- Any rating level

**Coverage:**
- Up to $40,000
- Guaranteed acceptance
- Whole life policy
- Premium never increases

### When to Use These

**S-DVI:**

- Within 2-year window

**VALife:**
- Older veterans with disability rating
- Need guaranteed issue whole life
- Final expense coverage

## Making the Decision

### Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **What's my health status?**
   - Healthy = probably shop private
   - Issues = VGLI makes sense

2. **How much coverage do I need?**
   - Calculate income replacement
   - Consider debts and obligations
   - Factor in family needs

3. **What's my budget?**
   - Compare VGLI vs. private rates
   - Consider long-term costs
   - Factor in rate increases

4. **How long do I need coverage?**
   - Temporary need = term may be better
   - Lifetime = consider whole life options
   - Until kids grown = 20-year term

### Coverage Calculation

**Rule of thumb:**
- 10-12x annual income
- Plus outstanding debts
- Plus education costs for children
- Minus other assets/insurance

**Example:**
- Income: $75,000
- Coverage need: $750,000-$900,000
- VGLI max: $500,000
- May need additional private coverage

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Missing the 240-Day Deadline

**Consequence:** Lose guaranteed approval
**Fix:** Set reminders immediately upon separation

### 2. Not Shopping Alternatives

**Consequence:** Overpay for years
**Fix:** Get private quotes before deciding

### 3. Assuming VGLI Is Best

**Consequence:** Higher premiums than necessary
**Fix:** Compare rates; healthy vets often do better private

### 4. Taking Too Little Coverage

**Consequence:** Family underprotected
**Fix:** Calculate actual needs, not just matching SGLI

### 5. Forgetting Age-Based Increases

**Consequence:** Budget surprises every 5 years
**Fix:** Project future costs in planning

### 6. Not Naming Beneficiaries

**Consequence:** Proceeds go through estate, delays
**Fix:** Designate primary and contingent beneficiaries

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: When does SGLI coverage actually end?**
A: 120 days after separation (free extension), then stops unless converted.

**Q: What if I had reduced SGLI while serving?**
A: Your VGLI max is whatever SGLI you had.

**Q: Can I increase VGLI coverage later?**
A: Only with evidence of insurability (medical underwriting).

**Q: Can I decrease VGLI coverage?**
A: Yes, any time, in $10,000 increments.

**Q: Can I convert VGLI to a private policy?**
A: Yes, to certain commercial policies without health exam.

**Q: What if I return to active duty?**

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Healthy Veteran, Better Private Rate

**Profile:** 28-year-old, excellent health, $400,000 coverage needed

**VGLI:**
- Monthly cost: $32.00 now
- At age 50: $188.00/month

**Private term (20-year):**
- Monthly cost: $22.00 locked
- Total 20-year cost: $5,280

**Decision:** Private insurance saves thousands

### Example 2: Veteran with Health Issues

**Profile:** 35-year-old, service-connected PTSD, diabetes

**VGLI:**
- Monthly cost: $52.00
- Guaranteed approval
- No health questions

**Private:**
- Likely declined or rated up significantly
- Mental health history problematic
- Would cost $150+/month if approved

**Decision:** VGLI is the right choice

### Example 3: Using Both Strategically

**Profile:** 32-year-old, some health issues, unsure of insurability

**Strategy:**
1. Applied for VGLI at day 200 ($40/month)
2. Simultaneously applied for private
3. Private approved at $35/month
4. Cancelled VGLI after private policy issued

**Result:** Got best rate while having guaranteed backup
