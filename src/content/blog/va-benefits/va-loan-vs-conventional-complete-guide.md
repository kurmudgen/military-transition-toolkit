# VA Loan vs Conventional Mortgage: Which Is Better Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **VA loan usually wins:** No down payment, no PMI, often lower rates
- **Typical savings:** $200-500/month compared to conventional with PMI
- **When conventional might be better:** Investment property, non-occupancy, already have 20% down with excellent credit
- **The math matters:** Run both scenarios for YOUR situation
- **Insider tip:** Even with 20% down, VA often beats conventional due to rate differences

## Head-to-Head Comparison

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | VA Loan | Conventional |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Down payment | 0% | 3-20% |
| PMI | None | Required under 20% |
| Interest rate | Often 0.25-0.5% lower | Market rate |
| Credit score | Flexible (often 580+) | Typically 620+ |

## The Cost Comparison

### Scenario: $400,000 Home, First-Time Buyer

**VA Loan:**
- Down payment: $0
- Funding fee: $8,600 (2.15%, financed)
- Total loan: $408,600
- Interest rate: 6.25%
- Monthly P&I: $2,516
- PMI: $0
- **Total monthly: $2,516**

**Conventional (5% down):**
- Down payment: $20,000
- Loan amount: $380,000
- Interest rate: 6.5%
- Monthly P&I: $2,402
- PMI: ~$190/month
- **Total monthly: $2,592**

**VA advantage:** $76/month + kept $20,000

### Over Time Comparison

| Timeframe | VA Total Cost | Conventional Total Cost | VA Savings |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Year 1 | $30,192 | $31,104 | $912 |
| Year 5 | $150,960 | $155,520 | $4,560 |
| Year 10 | $301,920 | $296,928* | ~Break-even |

*Conventional PMI typically drops after reaching 20% equity (around year 7-10)

### When VA Wins Big

**Scenarios where VA is clearly better:**
- No down payment saved
- Credit score 660-720
- Want to keep cash liquid
- Exempt from funding fee (disability)

**VA advantage grows when:**
- Funding fee exempt
- Lower credit score
- No down payment available
- Competitive markets (faster closing)

## When Conventional Might Win

### Scenario 1: Excellent Credit, 20% Down

**If you have:**
- 780+ credit score
- 20% down payment
- Want lowest possible payment

**Conventional advantages:**
- No funding fee
- No PMI (20% down)
- May get very competitive rate

**Example ($400,000 home):**

| Factor | VA | Conventional 20% |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| Down payment | $0 | $80,000 |
| Funding fee | $8,600 | $0 |
| Loan amount | $408,600 | $320,000 |
| Rate | 6.25% | 6.25% |
| Monthly P&I | $2,516 | $1,970 |

**Conventional wins on payment but:**
- You paid $80,000 down
- Investment opportunity cost
- $80,000 earning 7% = $5,600/year

### Scenario 2: Investment Property

**VA doesn't allow:**
- Investment property purchase
- Must be primary residence

**If you want rental property:**
- Conventional required
- Or buy with VA, convert to rental later

### Scenario 3: Second Home

**VA doesn't allow:**
- Vacation homes
- Second homes

**Conventional allows:**
- Second home purchase
- Different from investment property rules

### Scenario 4: Speed and Simplicity

**Some situations favor conventional:**
- Seller hesitant about VA
- Extremely competitive market
- Need fastest closing possible

**Reality check:** Good VA lenders close just as fast as conventional.

## The Funding Fee Factor

### Understanding the Trade-Off

**VA funding fee vs. PMI:**

| Loan Amount | VA Funding Fee (2.15%) | Conventional PMI (5 years) |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| $300,000 | $6,450 | ~$9,000 ($150/month) |
| $400,000 | $8,600 | ~$12,000 ($200/month) |
| $500,000 | $10,750 | ~$15,000 ($250/month) |

**Funding fee is usually less than 5+ years of PMI.**

### When Funding Fee Is Exempt

**You pay $0 funding fee if:**
- VA disability rating (any percentage)
- Purple Heart recipient (active duty)
- Surviving spouse receiving DIC

**With exemption, VA almost always wins.**

### Funding Fee vs. 20% Down

**Should I save 20% to avoid PMI or use VA?**

**Math:**
- 20% down on $400K = $80,000
- VA funding fee = $8,600
- **You keep $71,400 by using VA**

**That $71,400:**
- Invested at 7% = $5,000/year
- Emergency fund
- Other investments
- Debt payoff

## Interest Rate Comparison

### Why VA Rates Are Often Lower

**Factors:**
- Government guarantee reduces lender risk
- No default insurance costs
- Competition among VA lenders

**Typical rate difference:** 0.25-0.50% lower than conventional

### Rate Impact Over Time

**$400,000 loan, 30 years:**

| Rate | Monthly Payment | Total Interest |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| 6.50% | $2,528 | $510,177 |
| 6.25% | $2,463 | $486,573 |
| 6.00% | $2,398 | $463,353 |

**0.25% rate savings = $23,604 over loan life**

## Credit Score Impact

### How Scores Affect Each Loan Type

**VA Loans:**
- No VA-mandated minimum
- Lenders typically want 580-620
- More flexibility with lower scores
- Manual underwriting available

**Conventional:**
- Typically need 620+
- Best rates at 740+
- Higher scores = lower PMI
- Less flexibility

### Rate Comparison by Credit Score

| Credit Score | VA Rate (Est.) | Conventional Rate (Est.) |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 760+ | 6.00% | 6.25% |
| 720-759 | 6.25% | 6.50% |
| 680-719 | 6.50% | 7.00% |
| 640-679 | 6.75% | 7.50%+ |
| 620-639 | 7.25% | 8.00%+ |
| Below 620 | Possible | Difficult |

**VA provides larger advantage at lower credit scores.**

## Down Payment Analysis

### Opportunity Cost of Down Payment

**$80,000 down payment (20% on $400K):**

**If invested instead (7% return):**
- Year 5: $112,000
- Year 10: $157,000
- Year 20: $309,000
- Year 30: $609,000

**Using VA loan keeps money working for you.**

### Down Payment vs. Funding Fee

| Scenario | Out of Pocket | Equity Position |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| VA 0% down | $8,600 (funded) | $0 initially |
| Conv. 5% down | $20,000 | $20,000 |
| Conv. 10% down | $40,000 | $40,000 |
| Conv. 20% down | $80,000 | $80,000 |

**Lower equity isn't necessarily bad—leverage is a tool.**

## Closing Cost Comparison

### What Veterans Can't Be Charged

**VA limits "non-allowable" fees:**
- Prepayment penalties
- Attorney fees (most)
- Excessive origination fees
- Various junk fees

**Conventional has no such restrictions.**

### Seller Concession Limits

| Loan Type | Seller Concession Limit |
|-----------|------------------------|
| VA | 4% of purchase price |
| Conventional (under 10% down) | 3% |
| Conventional (10-25% down) | 6% |
| Conventional (25%+ down) | 9% |

**VA's 4% is competitive for low down payment scenarios.**

## Property Type Considerations

### What Each Loan Allows

| Property Type | VA | Conventional |
|---------------|-----|--------------|
| Primary residence | ✓ | ✓ |
| Second home | ✗ | ✓ |
| Investment property | ✗ | ✓ |
| 1-4 unit (owner-occupied) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Condo (approved) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manufactured home | ✓ | Limited |

### Multi-Unit Properties

**VA allows 1-4 units if:**
- You occupy one unit
- Rental income can help qualify

**Strategy:** Buy 4-plex with VA, live in one, rent three.

## Appraisal Differences

### VA Appraisal

**Requirements:**
- Minimum Property Requirements (MPRs)
- Safety and livability standards
- May require repairs before closing
- Can be seen as more stringent

**Reality:** Most properties pass VA appraisal.

### Conventional Appraisal

**Requirements:**
- Primarily value-focused
- Fewer condition requirements
- Faster in some cases

### When Appraisal Matters

**VA appraisal concerns:**
- Fixer-uppers may not pass
- Seller repair negotiations
- Possible delays

**Solutions:**
- VA renovation loan
- Negotiate repairs in contract
- Choose move-in ready homes

## Assumability

### VA Loan Advantage

**VA loans are assumable:**
- Buyer can take over your loan
- Keeps your interest rate
- Can be selling advantage

**Example:**
- Your VA loan: 3.5% rate (from 2021)
- Current rates: 7%
- Buyer assumes your loan at 3.5%
- Major selling point

### Conventional Loans

**Usually not assumable:**
- Due-on-sale clause
- Buyer needs own financing
- No rate transfer benefit

## Making the Right Choice

### Use VA Loan If:

✓ You don't have 20% down
✓ You want to keep cash liquid
✓ Your credit score is under 740
✓ You're exempt from funding fee
✓ You want lower monthly payment
✓ It's your primary residence
✓ You want assumability option

### Consider Conventional If:

✓ You have 20% down AND 760+ credit
✓ You're buying investment property
✓ You're buying a second home
✓ Property won't pass VA appraisal
✓ You want fastest possible closing
✓ You have specific lender relationships

### Run Both Scenarios

**Always get quotes for both:**
1. Apply with VA-specialized lender
2. Apply with conventional lender
3. Compare total costs
4. Consider opportunity costs
5. Make informed decision

- Rate: 6.5%
- Monthly: $2,212
- Out of pocket: ~$5,000 closing

**Conventional:**
- Cannot qualify with 3% down at 680 score
