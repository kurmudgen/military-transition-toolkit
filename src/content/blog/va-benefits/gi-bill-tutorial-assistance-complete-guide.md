# Tutorial Assistance with GI Bill: Getting Extra Help Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** VA pays for tutoring if you're struggling in a required course while using GI Bill
- **Who qualifies:** Veterans and dependents using VA education benefits who have a deficiency in a required subject
- **How much:** Up to $100/month per subject, maximum $1,200 total
- **Key requirement:** Must show educational deficiency and need for tutoring
- **Insider tip:** This is a separate benefit that doesn't reduce your GI Bill entitlement—use it if you need help

## What Is VA Tutorial Assistance?

Tutorial Assistance is a lesser-known VA benefit that pays for individual tutoring when you're struggling in a required course. It's designed to help veterans succeed academically by covering the cost of extra help.

**Key features:**
- Pays for one-on-one tutoring
- Up to $100 per month per subject
- Maximum lifetime benefit of $1,200
- Does NOT reduce your GI Bill months
- Separate from regular education benefits

**This benefit exists because:**
Many veterans have been away from academics for years and may need extra help transitioning back to college-level coursework. Tutorial assistance bridges that gap.

## Who Qualifies?

### Eligibility Requirements

To receive Tutorial Assistance, you must:

1. **Be receiving VA education benefits** under:
   - Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)
   - Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (Chapter 30)
   - Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (Chapter 1606)
   - Reserve Educational Assistance Program (Chapter 1607)
   - Vocational Rehabilitation (Chapter 31)
   - Dependents' Educational Assistance (Chapter 35)

2. **Be enrolled at least half-time** in an approved program

3. **Have a deficiency in a subject** that is required for your program

4. **The subject must be part of your approved program** (not electives or non-required courses)

### What Is a "Deficiency"?

A deficiency means:
- You're at risk of failing the course
- Your current grade is below acceptable standards
- You're struggling to understand the material
- You need additional help to pass

**You don't need to be failing** to qualify—showing difficulty that warrants tutoring is sufficient.

### Who CANNOT Use Tutorial Assistance

- Students enrolled less than half-time
- Those not receiving VA education benefits
- Students needing help in non-required courses
- Those who have exhausted the $1,200 maximum

## How Much Will You Get?

### Payment Rates

| Category | Maximum |
|----------|---------|
| Per subject, per month | $100 |
| Lifetime maximum | $1,200 |

### How Payment Works

- VA pays the tutor directly, or
- You pay the tutor, then get reimbursed
- Payment is for actual tutoring costs
- Does not reduce your GI Bill entitlement

### What's Covered

Tutorial assistance covers:
- Tutor fees
- Individual instruction costs
- One-on-one tutoring sessions

### What's NOT Covered

- Group tutoring sessions
- Tutoring for elective courses
- Study materials or supplies
- Tutoring centers (unless individual sessions)

## Finding a Tutor

### Step 1: Check School Resources

Most schools offer free or low-cost tutoring:
- Campus tutoring center
- Department tutoring services
- Peer tutoring programs
- Graduate student tutors

**Try free resources first** before using your limited Tutorial Assistance benefit.

### Step 2: Find Qualified Tutors

If you need paid tutoring:
- School-approved tutoring services
- Certified tutors in your subject area
- Graduate students in the field
- Professional tutoring services

**Requirements for tutors:**
- Must be qualified in the subject
- Cannot be a family member
- Should have credentials or expertise

### Step 3: Verify Hourly Rates

Common tutoring rates:
| Subject Type | Typical Rate |
|-------------|--------------|
| General subjects | $25-40/hour |
| STEM subjects | $40-60/hour |
| Graduate level | $50-80/hour |
| Specialized subjects | $60-100/hour |

With $100/month limit:
- At $25/hour: 4 hours of tutoring
- At $50/hour: 2 hours of tutoring
- At $100/hour: 1 hour of tutoring

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Document Your Need

Gather evidence of deficiency:
- Current grade in the course
- Test/quiz scores
- Instructor feedback
- Your assessment of difficulty

### Step 2: Get Instructor Certification

Your instructor must certify that:
- You have a deficiency in the subject
- Tutoring is necessary
- The subject is required for your program

**VA Form 22-1990t** includes this certification section.

### Step 3: Complete Application

**VA Form 22-1990t (Application for Tutorial Assistance):**
1. Download from VA.gov
2. Complete Section I (Personal Information)
3. Have instructor complete Section II (Certification)
4. Complete Section III (Tutoring Details)

### Step 4: Submit Application

**Submit to:**
- Your school's certifying official, OR
- VA Regional Processing Office

**Required attachments:**
- Completed VA Form 22-1990t
- Instructor's certification
- Tutor's information
- Itemized tutoring bill (if seeking reimbursement)

### Step 5: Receive Approval/Payment

Processing time: 2-4 weeks

Options:
- VA pays tutor directly
- VA reimburses you after you pay

## Timeline

| Step | Timeframe |
|------|-----------|
| Identify need | Early in semester |
| Get instructor certification | 1 week |
| Find tutor | 1-2 weeks |
| Complete VA Form 22-1990t | 1 day |
| Submit application | Same day |
| VA processing | 2-4 weeks |
| Payment/reimbursement | 2-3 weeks after approval |

**Best practice:** Apply as soon as you identify difficulty, not right before finals.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Waiting Until It's Too Late
Apply early in the semester when you first notice difficulty. Waiting until the last week before finals limits your options.

### 2. Not Trying Free Resources First
Many schools offer free tutoring. Use the VA benefit when free options aren't sufficient.

### 3. Using for Non-Required Courses
Tutorial assistance only covers required courses for your program. Electives don't qualify.

### 4. Group Tutoring
VA only pays for individual (one-on-one) tutoring, not group sessions.

### 5. Not Getting Instructor Sign-Off
Your instructor must certify your deficiency. Without this, your application will be denied.

### 6. Exceeding the $100/Month Limit
Even if tutoring costs more, VA only pays up to $100/month per subject.

### 7. Forgetting the $1,200 Lifetime Cap
This is a lifetime maximum. Use it wisely over your academic career.

### 8. Not Submitting for Reimbursement
If you paid out of pocket, submit for reimbursement promptly with receipts.

## Maximizing Tutorial Assistance

### Use Strategically

Save this benefit for:
- Critical required courses
- High-stakes subjects (prerequisites)
- Courses where you're genuinely struggling
- Subjects with expensive tutoring rates

### Combine with Free Resources

First layer: Free school tutoring (unlimited)
Second layer: Study groups (free)
Third layer: VA Tutorial Assistance (when needed)

### Plan for Multiple Courses

With $1,200 lifetime:
- $100/month = 12 months total tutoring
- Or 2-3 subjects over several semesters
- Budget this resource across your degree

### Time It Right

Apply when you:
- First notice difficulty (early semester)
- Have exams coming up
- Are at risk of dropping below passing

### Track Your Usage

Keep records of:
- Tutoring hours used
- Amount spent
- Subjects covered
- Remaining balance toward $1,200

## How Tutorial Assistance Stacks With Other Benefits

### Does NOT Affect:
- GI Bill entitlement (no months used)
- Monthly housing allowance
- Books and supplies stipend
- VA disability compensation
- Other financial aid

### Works Alongside:
- Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits
- VR&E benefits
- School tutoring services
- Federal work-study
- Pell Grants

### Important Notes:
- This is an ADD-ON benefit, not a substitute
- Using tutorial assistance doesn't reduce GI Bill months
- Can use while on active duty if enrolled
