## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Using Mail Order

Mail order saves:
- Time (no pharmacy visits)
- Money (90-day at 30-day copay)
- Hassle (auto-refills available)

### 2. Not Refilling Early Enough

Order refills with 10-14 days supply left:
- Allows processing time
- Prevents running out
- Mail delivery takes time

### 3. Not Knowing Copay Exemptions

Even in Priority Groups 7-8:
- Service-connected = no copay
- 50%+ rating = no copays on anything
- Check if you qualify for exemption

### 4. Using Retail Pharmacy When VA Covers

Using retail pharmacy costs more:
- VA copays are lower
- VA may not reimburse retail purchases
- Use VA or VA-authorized only

### 5. Not Keeping Address Updated

For mail order:
- Update address immediately if you move
- Medications sent to old address = delays
- Update via My HealtheVet or contact VA

### 6. Not Asking About Non-Formulary

If told medication isn't covered:
- Ask provider to request exception
- Provide medical necessity
- Often gets approved

### 7. Missing the $700 Cap

If paying copays, track your spending:
- $700 annual cap exists
- After cap, copays stop
- Resets each calendar year

### 8. Not Using My HealtheVet

Online management is easier:
- Refill anytime
- Track shipments
- See medication list
- Set reminders
