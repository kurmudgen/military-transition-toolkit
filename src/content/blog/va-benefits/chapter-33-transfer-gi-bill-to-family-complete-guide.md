# Chapter 33 Transfer: How to Give GI Bill to Family Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front
- **What it is:** Transfer your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to your spouse or children
- **Key requirement:** You MUST transfer while still serving—cannot transfer after separation
- **Service commitment:** 4 additional years of service (with exceptions)
- **How much can transfer:** 1-36 months to one or multiple dependents
- **Insider tip:** Start the transfer early in your career; the 4-year commitment becomes impossible as you approach retirement or ETS

## What Is GI Bill Transfer?

The Transfer of Education Benefits (TEB) program allows eligible service members to transfer some or all of their Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits to their spouse and/or children.

**This is NOT automatic.** You must:
1. Apply to transfer benefits while still serving
2. Commit to additional service (usually 4 years)
3. Designate specific dependents and amounts
4. Get approval from the Department of Defense

Once transferred, your dependents receive the same valuable Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits:
- Tuition and fees paid to school
- Monthly housing allowance
- Books and supplies stipend
- Yellow Ribbon eligibility (if you have 100%)

## Who Qualifies?

### Service Member Requirements

To transfer GI Bill benefits, the service member must:

1. **Be on active duty or in the Selected Reserve** at the time of transfer
2. **Have at least 6 years of service** (active duty and/or Selected Reserve) at the time of transfer
3. **Agree to serve 4 additional years** from the date of transfer (with exceptions)
4. **Be approved by their branch of service**

### Eligible Dependents

You can transfer to:

**Spouse:**
- Must be legally married
- Spouse can use benefits immediately (while you're still serving)
- No age restrictions

**Children:**
- Biological children
- Adopted children
- Stepchildren
- Must be enrolled in DEERS
- Can use benefits only after you complete 10 years of service
- Must use benefits before age 26 (with some extensions)

### Service Commitment Requirements

| Situation | Additional Service Required |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Standard transfer | 4 years |
| 10+ years of service at transfer | Service until retirement eligible |
| Certain retirement-eligible members | No additional service (varies by branch) |
| Medical retirement pending | May be waived |
| Force shaping/involuntary separation | May be waived |

### Branch-Specific Rules

Each service branch has slightly different policies. Check with your branch's education office:
- **Army:** HRC (Human Resources Command)
- **Navy:** Navy Personnel Command
- **Air Force:** AFPC (Air Force Personnel Center)
- **Marines:** MMRP-5 (Manpower Plans)
- **Coast Guard:** Personnel Service Center
- **Space Force:** Similar to Air Force

## How Much Can You Transfer?

### Allocation Options

You can transfer:
- All 36 months to one dependent
- Split months among multiple dependents
- Transfer different amounts to spouse vs. children
- Keep some months for yourself

### Example Allocations

**Example 1: All to spouse**
- Spouse: 36 months
- Children: 0 months

**Example 2: Split among children**
- Child 1: 18 months
- Child 2: 18 months

**Example 3: Family split**
- Spouse: 12 months
- Child 1: 12 months
- Child 2: 12 months

**Example 4: Partial transfer**
- Service member keeps: 18 months
- Child: 18 months

### Reallocation

After initial transfer, you can:
- Reallocate months between dependents (while still serving)
- Revoke spouse's benefits (even after separation)
- Cannot revoke children's benefits after separation (with limited exceptions)
- Cannot take back months you've kept for yourself after separation

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Verify Eligibility

Before starting, confirm:
1. You have at least 6 years of service
2. You're currently serving (active duty or Selected Reserve)
3. You can commit to 4 additional years (or meet exception criteria)
4. Your dependents are enrolled in DEERS

### Step 2: Calculate Your Options

Consider:
- How many months do you want to keep?
- Which dependents will you include?
- When will each dependent need benefits?
- Your remaining service commitment capacity

### Step 3: Submit Transfer Request

**Online (milConnect):**
1. Go to milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil
2. Sign in with CAC or DS Logon
3. Navigate to "Transfer of Education Benefits"
4. Complete the TEB request
5. Designate dependents and months
6. Submit

**Through Your Branch:**
Some branches require additional paperwork:
- Army: Contact HRC or use AKO
- Navy: Use NSIPS or contact PSD
- Air Force: Use vMPF or contact MPF
- Marines: Contact IPAC

### Step 4: Await Approval

Processing time: 1-4 weeks typically

You'll receive notification of:
- Approval with details
- Denial with reasons
- Request for additional information

### Step 5: Dependent Uses Benefits

After approval:
1. Dependent applies for Post-9/11 GI Bill (VA Form 22-1990e)
2. Provides service member's COE or approval letter
3. Enrolls in school
4. School certifies enrollment
5. Benefits begin

## Timeline

| Step | Timeframe |
|------|-----------|
| Verify eligibility | 1-2 days |
| Submit TEB request | Same day |
| DOD approval | 1-4 weeks |
| Dependent VA application | 2-4 weeks |
| First benefit payment | 4-6 weeks after enrollment |

**Critical timeline consideration:** Start the transfer process EARLY. If you wait until your last year of service, you may not be able to commit to 4 additional years.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Waiting Until Separation
The #1 mistake: You CANNOT transfer benefits after leaving the military. The transfer must be approved while you're still serving.

### 2. Not Starting Early Enough
If you're at 18 years of service and want to transfer, you may not be able to commit to 4 more years. Start the process with enough time.

### 3. Forgetting DEERS Enrollment
Dependents must be in DEERS to receive transferred benefits. Ensure all dependents are enrolled and information is current.

### 4. Not Understanding Child Age Limits
Children must generally use benefits before age 26. Plan accordingly.

### 5. Revoking Children's Benefits Too Late
After separation, you can only revoke children's benefits in very limited circumstances. Make allocation decisions carefully.

### 6. Assuming Spouse Gets Benefits Immediately
While spouses can start using benefits while you're serving, children typically must wait until you have 10+ years of service.

### 7. Ignoring Branch-Specific Requirements
Each branch has different policies. What works for Army may not work for Navy. Check your specific branch.

### 8. Not Updating Allocations
Life changes (divorce, new children). Update your TEB allocation while you're still serving if needed.

## Maximizing Transfer Benefits

### Strategic Timing

**Best time to transfer:**
- After 6 years of service
- Before your 15th year (to fulfill 4-year commitment before 20)
- When you can commit to additional service

**Too late to transfer:**
- Last 4 years before retirement (can't fulfill commitment)
- After separation (too late entirely)

### Child vs. Spouse Considerations

**Transfer to Spouse:**
- Can use immediately
- No age restriction
- Good for immediate education needs
- Benefits spouse if you divorce (unless revoked)

**Transfer to Children:**
- Must wait until you have 10 years service
- Must use before age 26 (mostly)
- Long-term investment
- Can reallocate between children
- Cannot revoke after separation (generally)

### Future-Proofing

Consider:
- Transfer more to children (long-term investment)
- Keep some for yourself (career change option)
- Transfer to spouse only what they'll actually use
- Leave flexibility for life changes

### Divorce Considerations

If you divorce:
- You CAN revoke spouse's unused benefits
- You generally CANNOT revoke children's benefits
- Make decisions before separation from military
- Consider potential custody arrangements

## Special Situations

### Medical Retirement

If you're being medically retired:
- You may qualify for TEB waiver of 4-year commitment
- Apply BEFORE your retirement orders are finalized
- Work with your branch's personnel office

### Involuntary Separation

Force shaping, RIF, or other involuntary separation:
- 4-year commitment may be waived
- Must apply before separation
- Branch-specific policies apply

### Recalled Retirees

Retirees recalled to active duty may be able to transfer:
- Must meet standard TEB requirements
- 4-year commitment still applies
- Consult with personnel office

### Guard and Reserve

Selected Reserve members can transfer:
- Must have 6 years in Selected Reserve
- Must commit to 4 more years in Selected Reserve
- Drilling status required at time of transfer

## How Transferred Benefits Work for Dependents

### Spouse Using Benefits

**While service member is on active duty:**
- Spouse receives tuition and fees
- Spouse receives housing allowance (based on school location)
- Spouse receives books stipend

**After service member separates:**
- Same benefits continue
- Housing based on school ZIP code

### Children Using Benefits

**Eligibility to start:**
- Service member must have 10+ years of service, OR
- Service member must be retired, OR
- Service member died in line of duty

**While using benefits:**
- Child receives tuition and fees
- Housing allowance depends on child's status:
  - If service member is on active duty: No housing (covered by military housing)
  - If service member is separated/retired: Full housing allowance
- Books stipend provided

### Age Restrictions for Children

| Situation | Age Limit |
|-----------|----------|
| Standard | Before 26th birthday |
| Service member died on active duty | Before 33rd birthday |
| Child in military service | Extends by time served |

### How to Address Denials

1. **Verify service dates** - Ensure calculation includes all qualifying service
2. **Check DEERS enrollment** - Add missing dependents
3. **Consult personnel office** - Get specific guidance
4. **Request reconsideration** - With additional documentation
5. **Contact IG** - If you believe there's an error

### Appeals Process

Each branch has its own appeals process:
- Request written denial reason
- Submit appeal with supporting documentation
- Work through chain of command
- Consider congressional inquiry if appropriate
