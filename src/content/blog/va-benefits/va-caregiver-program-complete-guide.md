## What Is the VA Caregiver Program?

The VA Caregiver Support Program helps family members who care for veterans with serious injuries or illnesses. There are two main components:

The flagship program providing:
- Monthly stipend payments to caregivers
- Health insurance (if not otherwise eligible)

- Respite care
- Caregiver training

### Program of General Caregiver Support Services (PGCSS)

Available to all veteran caregivers:
- Education and training
- Peer support
- Telephone support line
- Online resources

## PCAFC: The Comprehensive Program

### Eligibility Requirements

**For the Veteran:**

1. **Service-connected condition OR serious injury/illness**
   - For veterans who served on or before May 7, 1975: Must have 70%+ service-connected disability rating
   - For veterans who served after May 7, 1975: Serious injury (including TBI, psychological trauma, or other) incurred or aggravated in the line of duty

2. **Need personal care services** due to:
   - Inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), OR
   - Need for supervision, protection, or instruction due to neurological or psychological impairment

3. **Enrolled in VA healthcare**

**For the Caregiver:**

1. **At least 18 years old**
2. **Family member or someone who lives with the veteran** (or will do so if designated)
3. **Capable of providing personal care services**
4. **Not a member of the Armed Forces on active duty**

### What ADLs Mean

Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) include:
- Dressing
- Bathing
- Grooming
- Adjusting prosthetics
- Toileting
- Feeding
- Mobility (ambulating)

If the veteran needs help with multiple ADLs, they likely qualify.

### Supervision Needs

The program also covers veterans who need:
- Supervision for safety
- Protection from self-harm
- Instruction for daily activities
- Cueing for routine tasks

This is particularly relevant for TBI and cognitive impairments.

## PCAFC Benefits

### Monthly Stipend

The stipend is based on:
- **Care level:** Assessed by VA (Tier 1, 2, or 3)
- **Location:** Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) wage data for your area

**2024-2025 Approximate Ranges:**

| Care Tier | Description | Monthly Stipend Range |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Tier 1 | Moderate care needs | $1,000-1,800/month |
| Tier 2 | Significant care needs | $2,000-2,800/month |
| Tier 3 | Highest care needs | $2,800-3,500+/month |

**Example:** A Tier 2 caregiver in a high-cost area like San Francisco could receive $3,000+/month.

**Q: Does the caregiver have to be a family member?**

A: No. PCAFC stipends are not considered taxable income.

A: Yes, if you can still provide necessary care. The program recognizes caregiving may not require 24/7 presence.
