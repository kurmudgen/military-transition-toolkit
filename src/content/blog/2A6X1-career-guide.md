## Salary

| Experience | No A&P | With A&P |
|---|---|---|
| Entry | $38K-$55K | $55K-$70K |
| Mid | $50K-$70K | $70K-$95K |
| Senior | $60K-$85K | $85K-$115K |
| Management | $70K-$100K | $100K-$150K |

**Powerplant Specialty Premium:** Engine specialists often earn $5K-$15K more than general A&Ps.

## Action Plan

**Months 1-3:** Get A&P (powerplant focus), network with engine manufacturers, apply to engine shops and airlines with in-house capabilities.

## Common Mistakes

Not emphasizing engine specialization (engines are niche, well-paid), only targeting airlines (manufacturers also hire), ignoring power generation industry (gas turbines similar technology).

## Interview Prep
