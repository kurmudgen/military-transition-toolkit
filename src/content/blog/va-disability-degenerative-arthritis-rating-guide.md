# VA Disability Rating for Degenerative Arthritis: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis/DJD) is rated under **Diagnostic Codes 5003** (degenerative arthritis) or **5010** (traumatic arthritis). Ratings are based on **limitation of motion** of the affected joint under that joint's specific diagnostic code. If limitation of motion is noncompensable, arthritis with X-ray evidence and painful motion receives a minimum **10%** per major joint or group of joints. Veterans should claim each affected joint separately. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Degenerative Arthritis?

Degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) is the most common form of arthritis, involving the breakdown of cartilage in joints.

**Types:**
- **Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD)**: General wear and tear, DC 5003
- **Traumatic Arthritis**: Resulting from injury, DC 5010 (rated as degenerative)

**Commonly affected joints in veterans:**
- Knees
- Hips
- Spine (cervical and lumbar)
- Shoulders
- Ankles
- Hands and wrists

**Military causes:**
- Repetitive joint stress
- Direct joint injuries
- Carrying heavy loads
- Running and physical training
- Vehicle accidents
- Airborne operations
- Years of physical demands

## VA Rating Criteria

### DC 5003/5010 - Degenerative/Traumatic Arthritis

Arthritis is rated based on **limitation of motion** of the affected joint. When limitation of motion would be noncompensable (0%), arthritis provides:

**With X-ray evidence of arthritis:**
- **10%** for 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups with occasional incapacitating episodes
- **20%** for 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups with occasional incapacitating episodes

**Per 38 CFR § 4.59 - Painful Motion:**
With X-ray evidence of arthritis, joints that exhibit painful motion receive at least the minimum compensable rating for that joint, even if limitation of motion doesn't meet criteria.

### Rating by Joint

Each joint is rated under its own diagnostic code:

**Knees:**
- DC 5260 (limitation of flexion): 0-30%
- DC 5261 (limitation of extension): 0-50%

**Hips:**
- DC 5252 (limitation of flexion): 0-40%
- DC 5251 (limitation of extension): 10%

**Shoulders:**
- DC 5201 (limitation of motion): 20-40%

**Spine:**
- DC 5237-5243 (cervical or thoracolumbar): 10-100%

**Ankles:**
- DC 5271 (limited motion): 10-20%

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing joint complaints
- Documentation of joint injuries
- Physical demands of MOS
- Long-term wear and tear from service activities

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- **X-rays showing arthritis** (critical)
- Orthopedic evaluation
- Range of motion measurements
- Documentation of painful motion

### Severity Evidence
- Range of motion limitations
- Impact on daily activities
- Treatment records
- Failed conservative treatments

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**For each affected joint:**
1. Range of motion testing
2. Pain on motion assessment
3. Testing after repetitive motion
4. Assessment of flare-ups
5. Review of X-rays

**Important:** Tell the examiner where pain begins during each movement. Pain on motion supports higher ratings.

## Key Points

1. **Get X-rays before filing** - X-ray evidence is essential for arthritis claims
2. **Claim each joint separately** - Don't just claim "arthritis"—specify knees, back, shoulders, etc.
3. **Document painful motion** - Even with good range of motion, painful motion with X-ray evidence of arthritis = minimum compensable rating
4. **Consider secondary conditions** - Arthritis in one joint can cause problems in others

## Secondary Conditions

**Arthritis can be secondary to:**
- Previous joint injuries
- Gait abnormalities from other conditions
- Overcompensation for other joints

**Arthritis can cause:**
- Gait changes affecting other joints
- Depression (chronic pain)
- Sleep disturbance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need X-rays to claim arthritis?
X-ray evidence of arthritis is important for these diagnostic codes. Get X-rays of affected joints before filing.

### Can I claim multiple joints?
Yes. Claim each affected joint separately. Each may receive its own rating.

### What if my range of motion is almost normal?
With X-ray evidence of arthritis and painful motion, you should receive at least the minimum compensable rating for that joint under 38 CFR § 4.59.

### Is traumatic arthritis different from degenerative arthritis?
Traumatic arthritis (from injury) is rated the same as degenerative arthritis under DC 5010.
