## Bottom Line Up Front

You're not just a military planner—you're a **logistics professional with transportation planning expertise, supply chain coordination experience, multimodal shipment management, resource allocation skills, systems proficiency, and proven ability to execute complex logistics operations under pressure**. The civilian logistics industry is booming. E-commerce, global supply chains, manufacturing, retail—every sector needs qualified logistics professionals who can plan, coordinate, and optimize transportation operations.

Realistic first-year civilian salaries for logistics professionals range from **$55,000-$75,000** for transportation coordinators and logistics analysts, scaling to **$75,000-$100,000** for supply chain specialists and transportation managers. Senior supply chain managers and logistics operations managers earn **$90,000-$130,000+**. Directors of logistics and supply chain executives can command **$120,000-$180,000+** at major corporations. Your military logistics experience is valuable—companies will pay for your planning, coordination, and execution skills.

Here's the reality: the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 17% growth in logistics jobs through 2034—much faster than average. The industry faces a shortage of qualified logistics professionals with real operational experience. You've coordinated military transportation operations—convoys, aerial ports, seaports, railheads, multimodal movements. You've managed manifests, movement schedules, cargo documentation, and worked with carriers and units. That's exactly what civilian logistics companies need.

The transition path is straightforward. Entry-level logistics coordinator positions ($55K-$70K) hire immediately with your military experience. Get professional certifications like APICS CSCP ($1,795) or Certified Logistics Technician ($1,800), and you're competitive for supply chain specialist roles ($70K-$90K). Within 3-5 years, logistics manager and operations manager positions ($85K-$120K+) are realistic. Major employers (Amazon, Walmart, FedEx, UPS, manufacturers, 3PLs) actively recruit veteran logistics professionals. Your planning skills, attention to detail, and ability to execute under pressure make you exactly what they need.

## What Does an Army 88N Transportation Management Coordinator Do?

As an 88N, you planned and coordinated military transportation operations across all modes—road, rail, air, and sea. You managed unit movements, convoy operations, and deployment logistics. You prepared movement plans, travel itineraries, and cargo manifests. You coordinated with units, carriers, transportation companies, aerial ports, seaports, and railheads. You used military transportation systems (TC-AIMS II, DTS, GATES) to book shipments, track cargo, and manage documentation.

You calculated cargo weights, dimensions, and transportation requirements. You determined optimal routes and modes of transportation. You managed hazmat shipments following DOT and international regulations. You coordinated customs documentation for international movements. You tracked shipments in-transit, resolved problems, and communicated status to customers and leadership.

You worked with commercial carriers, military transportation assets, and intermodal transportation. You understood freight classifications, transportation costs, capacity constraints, and scheduling. You prepared load plans, blocking and bracing diagrams, and ensured cargo compliance. You managed contingency planning—when missions changed, you replanned and re-coordinated immediately.

You maintained accountability for millions of dollars in equipment moving through the transportation system. You ensured on-time delivery supporting operational missions. When units needed to move, you made it happen—coordinating assets, managing schedules, solving problems, and executing plans flawlessly.

That's not just "booking trucks." That's **supply chain management, transportation planning, logistics coordination, multimodal operations, problem-solving, and operational execution**. The civilian world calls that logistics management, supply chain coordination, and transportation operations—and they'll pay you well for it.

### 4. Supply Chain Manager / Director of Logistics

**Companies hiring at this level:**
Fortune 500 companies, major manufacturers, large retailers, global corporations

**Path to get here:**
1. Start as coordinator ($55K-$70K) - Years 1-3
2. Advance to specialist/senior coordinator ($70K-$90K) - Years 3-5
3. Promote to manager ($85K-$115K) - Years 5-8
4. Achieve senior manager/director ($120K-$165K+) - Years 8-15

**Requirements:**
- Proven track record of results
- Professional certifications (CSCP, CPIM, PMP)
- Often MBA or master's degree
- Deep industry knowledge and network

### 5. Freight Broker / Account Manager

**What you'll do:** Match shippers (customers with freight) to carriers (trucks, trains, ships) who can move it. Negotiate rates, build customer relationships, manage transactions, and earn commissions on freight arranged.

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level freight broker:** $45,000-$65,000 (base + commission)
- **Experienced freight broker:** $70,000-$110,000+ (significant commission potential)
- **Top performers:** $120,000-$200,000+ (commission-heavy)

**Why 88N Coordinators succeed:** You understand transportation modes, carrier operations, pricing, and logistics. You're accustomed to coordinating with carriers and customers. Freight brokerage requires similar skills plus sales ability.

**Companies actively hiring:**
- **C.H. Robinson** - Largest freight broker
- **TQL (Total Quality Logistics)** - Major broker
- **Echo Global Logistics**
- **Coyote Logistics** (UPS company)
- **XPO Logistics**

**Reality check:** Freight brokerage is sales-heavy. You'll cold-call potential customers, build relationships, negotiate deals, and earn commissions on freight booked. High performers make excellent money ($100K-$200K+), but it requires sales skills, persistence, and thick skin. Some companies are "boiler room" environments with high pressure and turnover. Research companies carefully.

### 6. Government Logistics / Defense Contractor Positions

**What you'll do:** Use logistics expertise in government civilian roles or defense contractor positions supporting military operations, government agencies, or federal logistics programs.

**Salary ranges:**

**Certifications helpful:**
- **Security clearance** (maintain if possible—worth $15K-$25K in salary)
- **PMP**
- **DAWIA certifications** (for DoD acquisition positions)

**Reality check:** Government positions offer stability, benefits, and mission focus but typically pay 10-20% less than private sector for similar roles. Defense contractors pay better but work depends on contract awards. Good option if you value mission, stability, and want to continue supporting military operations.
