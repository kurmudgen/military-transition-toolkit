# Maryland Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Maryland offers strong tax benefits for veterans, particularly disabled veterans. With complete property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans, partial military retirement income exclusions, and county-specific benefits, understanding these programs can save you thousands annually.

If you're considering Maryland or already live here, this guide shows exactly what financial benefits you've earned.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Maryland offers veterans:

- **Military retirement pay**: Partial exemption ($12,500 under age 55; $20,000 ages 55+)
- **Property tax exemption**: 100% disabled veterans pay zero property taxes on primary residence
- **County property tax credits**: Many counties offer additional 15-20% credits for age 65+ veterans
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Vehicle registration**: Discounted disabled veteran plates ($20 vs. $135-$187)
- **Tuition benefits**: Edward T. Conroy Scholarship for 100% disabled veterans' dependents

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran in suburban Baltimore**: $3,500-$8,000+ depending on property value and county.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - Partial Exemption

Maryland offers a partial exemption on military retirement income, though not as generous as some neighboring states.

**Subtraction modification amounts**:
- **Under age 55**: Up to $12,500 of military retirement income excluded
- **Age 55 or older**: Up to $20,000 of military retirement income excluded

**What this means in practice**:

**Example 1: Retire at age 48 with $35,000/year pension**
- First $12,500 exempt
- Remaining $22,500 taxable at Maryland rates
- Annual tax on retirement pay: ~$1,237 (at 5.5% top rate)

**Example 2: Retire at age 58 with $50,000/year pension**
- First $20,000 exempt
- Remaining $30,000 taxable
- Annual tax on retirement pay: ~$1,650 (at 5.5% top rate)

**Eligibility**: Available to retired service members receiving military retired pay from an active or reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Maryland** | Partial ($12.5K-$20K exempt) | 2-5.75% (local 2.25-3.2%) | Full exemption |
| Virginia | Partial (varies by age) | 2-5.75% | Up to $10K reduction |
| West Virginia | Up to $20K exempt | 2.36-5.12% | Various |
| Pennsylvania | 100% exempt | 3.07% flat | Limited |
| Delaware | Up to $12.5K exempt | 2.2-6.6% | $12.5K exemption |
| D.C. | Partial | 4-10.75% | Varies |

Maryland's property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans is more generous than neighboring states, but the partial military retirement exemption is less generous than Pennsylvania (which exempts 100%).

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $171/month for a 10% rating or $3,900+/month for 100% with dependents, you pay zero taxes.

### State Tax Rates (Combined State + Local)

Maryland has a unique two-tier income tax system with both state and local components:

**State rates**:
- 2% on taxable income up to $1,000
- 3% on income $1,000-$2,000
- 4% on income $2,000-$3,000
- 4.75% on income $3,000-$100,000
- 5% on income $100,000-$125,000
- 5.25% on income $125,000-$150,000
- 5.50% on income $150,000-$250,000
- 5.75% on income over $250,000

**Plus local rates**: 2.25% to 3.20% depending on county

**Combined effective top rate**: 8.95% (in some counties)

**Standard deduction**: $2,550 (single), $5,150 (married) - Maryland has its own deduction separate from federal

### Financial Impact of Partial Exemption

Let's calculate real savings for military retirees:

**Scenario 1: E-7, 20 years, age 42, $40,000 retirement pay**
- Exempt: $12,500
- Taxable: $27,500
- Tax at 8.5% combined rate: $2,338
- **If fully taxed**: $3,400
- **Annual savings**: $1,062

**Scenario 2: O-5, 20 years, age 60, $65,000 retirement pay**
- Exempt: $20,000
- Taxable: $45,000
- Tax at 8.5% combined rate: $3,825
- **If fully taxed**: $5,525
- **Annual savings**: $1,700

While not as generous as full exemption, this still provides significant savings.

## Property Tax Exemptions for Veterans

### 100% Disabled Veterans - Complete Exemption

If you're rated 100% Permanent and Total (P&T) or 100% due to unemployability by the VA, you're exempt from **all property taxes** on your primary residence.

**No income limits. No property value caps.**

This is Maryland's most valuable veteran benefit.

#### Real-World Examples

**Howard County (Columbia)**
- Home value: $525,000
- Property tax rate: $1.014 per $100 of assessed value
- **Annual savings: $5,324**

- Property tax rate: $1.030 per $100
- **Annual savings: $3,914**

### Eligibility - Who Qualifies?

**You qualify if**:
- VA rating of 100% Permanent & Total (P&T)
- OR 100% due to Individual Unemployability (TDIU)
- You own and occupy the property as your principal residence

**Unremarried surviving spouses**: Also qualify for the exemption if:
- Spouse of 100% disabled veteran (continues after veteran's death)
- Spouse of service member killed in line of duty

### Partial Disability Ratings (Under 100%)

Maryland's state-level exemption applies only to 100% disabled veterans. If you're rated 90%, 70%, or any percentage under 100%, you don't qualify for the full exemption based solely on VA disability.

**However**: Several counties offer property tax credits for veterans with lower disability ratings.

### County-Specific Property Tax Credits

Many Maryland counties provide additional property tax benefits:

#### Age 65+ Veteran Credits

**Anne Arundel County**:
- 15% property tax credit for retired veterans age 65+
- Must have served at least 20 years or received honorable discharge due to service-connected disability
- Income limits may apply

**Cecil County**:
- 20% property tax credit for veterans age 65+ (up to 5 years)
- Adjusted gross income must be $84,000 or less
- Must have retired from military OR lived in home 40+ years

**Harford County**:
- 20% property tax credit for veterans age 65+
- Adjusted gross income $84,000 or less
- Same residency requirements as Cecil

#### Disability-Based Credits (Non-100%)

**Washington County**:
- Property tax credit for veterans with 50% or greater VA disability rating
- Graduated benefit based on rating percentage

**Check your county**: Contact your local assessment office for county-specific benefits. Many counties offer credits or exemptions beyond the state program.

### How to Apply for Property Tax Exemption

**Required documents**:
- VA rating decision letter showing 100% P&T or TDIU

### Homestead Tax Credit (All Homeowners)

Don't forget Maryland's Homestead Tax Credit, which limits annual assessment increases to 10% (or lower in some counties).

**This is separate from the veteran exemption** but can be combined.

**How it works**: If your home's assessed value increases more than 10% in a year, the Homestead Credit caps the increase for tax purposes.

**Application**: Most counties require one-time application; others apply automatically.

**Cost**: $20 (one-time fee) vs. $135-$187 for standard plates

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the total financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran in Maryland vs. other states.

### Scenario: E-7 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled, Age 60

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $40,000
- VA disability: $45,000 (100% with dependents)
- Total: $85,000

**Home**: $450,000 (median for Maryland suburbs)

### Maryland Savings Over 20 Years

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax exemption | $4,500 | $90,000 |
| Military retirement (first $20K exempt) | $1,700 | $34,000 |
| Vehicle registration discount | $100 | $2,000 |
| Conroy Scholarship (per dependent, 4 years) | $0* | $100,000** |
| **TOTAL (without education)** | **$6,300** | **$126,000** |

*Annual savings shown as $0 because it's a one-time benefit over 4-5 years
**Estimated value of 4 years of tuition, fees, room & board at UMD ($25K/year)

**Note**: This doesn't account for inflation or property value appreciation, which would increase savings over time.

### Comparison: Maryland vs. Virginia

Same scenario, comparing Maryland to Virginia (both partially exempt military retirement):

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Maryland | $90,000 | $34,000 | $126,000 |
| Virginia | ~$20,000 | ~$35,000 | ~$55,000 |

**Maryland advantage: $71,000 over 20 years** (primarily due to complete property tax exemption)

### Comparison: Maryland vs. Pennsylvania

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Maryland | $90,000 | $34,000 | $126,000 |
| Pennsylvania | Limited | $40,000 (full exemption) | ~$60,000 |

**Maryland advantage: $66,000 over 20 years**

Maryland's complete property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans makes it one of the best states financially, even though military retirement income isn't fully exempt.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?

No. Once approved, the exemption continues automatically as long as:
- You maintain 100% P&T or TDIU rating
- The property remains your principal residence
- You continue to own the home

Some counties may require periodic verification every few years.

### What if I'm rated 90% or lower?

Maryland's state property tax exemption applies only to 100% disabled veterans. However:
- You still benefit from partial military retirement income exemption ($12.5K-$20K)
- Tax-free VA disability compensation
- Vehicle registration discount (any disability rating)
- Check your county for additional credits (some counties offer credits for 50%+ ratings)

### Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption?

Yes. **Unremarried surviving spouses** of 100% disabled veterans can maintain the property tax exemption. If you remarry, you lose the exemption.

### Can I get the property tax exemption on a second home or rental property?

No. The exemption applies only to your principal residence (primary home you occupy).

### What if I'm rated 100% but not "Permanent & Total"?

You may still qualify. The exemption covers:
- 100% Permanent & Total (P&T)
- 100% due to Individual Unemployability (TDIU)

If you're 100% schedular but not designated P&T, contact your county assessor. Some may accept this; others may require P&T designation. If needed, work with your VA representative to request P&T status.

### Does the exemption apply to county AND state property taxes?

Yes. The exemption applies to all property taxes - both county and any state-levied portions.

### What happens if I move to a different county in Maryland?

You'll need to reapply with the new county's Department of Assessments and Taxation. Bring:
- Your previous exemption documentation
- New property information
- VA rating letter

The exemption should transfer, but you must notify the new county.

### How does Maryland's partial military retirement exemption compare to full exemption states?

Maryland exempts only $12,500-$20,000 vs. states like Alabama, Florida, or Pennsylvania that exempt 100%. However, Maryland's property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans often makes up the difference and more.

**For non-disabled retirees**: Full exemption states are better
**For 100% disabled veterans**: Maryland's total package is competitive or better

### Can I claim both the veteran exemption and homestead credit?

Yes! These are separate programs:
- **Veteran exemption**: Eliminates property taxes (if 100% disabled)
- **Homestead credit**: Caps annual assessment increases (for all homeowners)

If you're not 100% disabled, the homestead credit still helps control tax increases.

### Will these benefits affect my federal taxes?

No. Property tax exemptions and state income tax benefits don't impact federal tax liability. Military retirement and VA disability compensation remain tax-free at the federal level regardless of state benefits.

### Does Maryland tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, qualified retirement account withdrawals (TSP, 401k, IRA) are taxed as regular income at Maryland's combined state + local rates (up to 8.95% depending on county and income). Only military retirement income receives partial exemption.

### What if my county denies my exemption application?

You have the right to appeal:
1. Contact Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs: (410) 260-3838
2. Request review from county supervisor of assessments
3. File formal appeal with Maryland Tax Court (if necessary)
4. Contact your county veterans service officer for assistance

### Are dependents using the Conroy Scholarship eligible for other aid?

Yes, but Conroy is a "last dollar" scholarship. You must apply other grants and scholarships first, then Conroy fills remaining costs up to the cap.

**Stackable with**:
- Federal Pell Grants
- Maryland state grants
- Institutional scholarships
- Private scholarships

This can result in full coverage including books and expenses.

## Key Takeaways

Maryland delivers strong financial value for 100% disabled veterans:

1. **100% disabled veterans** can save $4,000-$6,700+ annually through property tax exemption alone
2. **All military retirees** save $1,000-$1,700 annually through partial income exemption
3. **Dependents of 100% disabled veterans** can receive $100,000+ in free education (Conroy Scholarship)
4. **County credits** provide additional benefits for age 65+ veterans
5. **Combined benefits** can exceed $125,000 over 20 years

Maryland's cost of living is high (19.5% above national average), but the property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans significantly offsets housing costs - often more than full military retirement exemption states.

**If you're 100% disabled and haven't applied for the property tax exemption**, do it immediately. With property taxes of $4,000-$6,700 annually on typical Maryland homes, this is worth $80,000-$135,000 over 20 years.
