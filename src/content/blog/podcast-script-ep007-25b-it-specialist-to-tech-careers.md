[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

If you're a 25B IT Specialist getting out of the Army, you've got skills that civilian tech companies are actively recruiting for. We're talking entry-level positions at sixty to seventy thousand, mid-level roles at eighty to a hundred thousand, and senior positions well over six figures. [pause] Let's talk about how to make that happen.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're talking specifically to Army 25 Bravos - Information Technology Specialists. Whether you've been doing help desk, server administration, network management, or cybersecurity work, you have marketable skills that translate directly to civilian IT careers.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering the specific civilian career paths that pay the most for 25Bs, the certifications that will double your salary potential, which companies are actively hiring Army IT specialists right now, and your 12-month transition roadmap to land a six-figure tech job. If you're 25B and getting out, this is your complete transition guide. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 23-25 minutes]

**Segment 1: Your 25B Experience and Why It's Valuable (4 minutes)**

Alright, let's start by understanding what you bring to the table as a 25B.

Your AIT at Fort Gordon gave you foundational IT skills - operating systems, networking basics, server administration, help desk operations. But more importantly, you've been doing hands-on IT work in a real operational environment.

You've likely been doing:
- Help desk support troubleshooting hardware and software issues
- Installing and configuring workstations and peripherals
- Managing user accounts in Active Directory
- Maintaining servers and network equipment
- Implementing security policies and procedures
- Working with Army IT systems like CPCE, ADPE, SIPR, NIPR networks

That's real IT experience. You've been supporting users, maintaining systems, troubleshooting problems, and working under strict security requirements. That's exactly what civilian companies need.

Here's why your 25B experience is valuable to civilian employers:

**First** - you understand security. You've worked on classified networks. You've implemented access controls. You've followed strict security protocols. Civilian companies - especially in healthcare, finance, and government contracting - need people who take security seriously.

**Second** - you can troubleshoot under pressure. When a commander's computer goes down before a briefing, you fix it. When network connectivity fails during operations, you figure it out. That problem-solving ability under pressure is incredibly valuable.

**Third** - you have customer service experience. Supporting users - especially impatient or non-technical users - is a huge part of civilian IT work. You've been doing that.

**Fourth** - you can work independently and follow procedures. You've used technical manuals, followed standard operating procedures, and figured things out on your own when necessary. That's critical in civilian IT roles where you won't always have someone looking over your shoulder.

Now let's talk salary reality. As a 25B on active duty, if you're an E4 or E5 with a few years in, you're probably making forty-five to fifty-five thousand dollars total with BAH and everything.

In the civilian world, entry-level IT positions for 25Bs start around sixty to seventy thousand. With a couple certifications and 3-5 years of experience, you're looking at eighty to one hundred thousand. Senior-level positions - systems architect, senior network engineer, cybersecurity engineer - those can pay one hundred twenty thousand to one hundred sixty thousand or more.

So the earning potential is significantly higher. But you need to position yourself correctly and get the right certifications.

**Segment 2: Civilian Career Paths for 25Bs (6 minutes)**

Let me break down the major career paths and what they pay.

**Help Desk / Desktop Support Specialist**

This is often the entry point. You're providing technical support to end users - troubleshooting computer problems, resetting passwords, installing software, replacing hardware.

Salary range: $45,000 to $65,000 for entry-level. This is actually lower than what some 25Bs can get, but it's a foot in the door if you don't have civilian experience or certifications yet.

Honestly, most 25Bs should skip this level if possible and go straight to systems administrator or network administrator roles. You've got more experience than help desk work requires.

**Systems Administrator**

This is managing servers, operating systems, user accounts, and IT infrastructure. You're doing tasks like:
- Managing Windows or Linux servers
- Administering Active Directory
- Maintaining email systems
- Managing backups and disaster recovery
- Implementing security patches and updates

Salary range: $60,000 to $95,000. Entry-level systems administrators at mid-size companies start around $60K to $70K. With 3-5 years of experience, you're looking at $80K to $95K.

This is a solid career path for 25Bs because you've likely been doing systems administration work already in the Army.

**Network Administrator / Network Engineer**

This is managing network infrastructure - routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs, wireless networks. You're configuring network equipment, troubleshooting connectivity issues, implementing network security, monitoring network performance.

Salary range: $65,000 to $110,000. Entry-level network administrators start around $65K to $75K. Network engineers with experience can make $90K to $110K or more.

If you worked on Army networks - managing switches, configuring routers, troubleshooting network issues - this is your path.

**Cybersecurity Analyst / Security Engineer**

This is one of the highest-paying paths. You're monitoring security systems, analyzing threats, implementing security controls, responding to incidents, conducting vulnerability assessments.

Salary range: $75,000 to $130,000+. Entry-level security analysts start around $70K to $80K. Experienced security engineers can make $100K to $130K or significantly more.

If you worked on Army cybersecurity - implementing security policies, managing firewalls, conducting security audits - you can transition to this career.

The demand for cybersecurity professionals is massive right now. Every company needs security people, and there aren't enough qualified candidates.

**Cloud Engineer / Cloud Administrator**

This is the hot career path right now. Managing cloud infrastructure - AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. You're deploying virtual machines, configuring cloud storage, managing cloud security, automating infrastructure.

Salary range: $90,000 to $150,000+. Even entry-level cloud engineers can start at $80K to $90K because demand is so high. Senior cloud engineers easily make $120K to $150K or more.

The Army is increasingly using cloud services, but most 25Bs don't have deep cloud experience yet. This is where certifications become critical - get AWS or Azure certs and you can jump into cloud roles at high salaries.

**DevOps Engineer**

This is a combination of systems administration, software development, and automation. You're building automated deployment pipelines, managing infrastructure as code, working with containers and orchestration tools.

Salary range: $95,000 to $140,000+. This is an advanced role that typically requires programming skills and experience with automation tools.

Not every 25B will go this route, but if you're interested in the technical side and you're willing to learn programming, DevOps engineers are in high demand and command high salaries.

**IT Manager / Director**

If you were an E6 or above managing IT teams, you have leadership experience that translates to IT management roles.

Salary range: $90,000 to $140,000+ for IT managers. Directors can make significantly more.

**Defense Contractors (DOD IT Work)**

If you have an active security clearance, there's massive demand for 25Bs to work as contractors on military bases or supporting DOD systems.

Salary range: $70,000 to $120,000+ depending on clearance level and location.

The advantage here is you already know the environment, you already understand DOD IT systems, and your clearance is extremely valuable. Active TS/SCI clearances can be worth $20K to $30K in additional salary.

Companies hiring for DOD IT work: CACI, Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, General Dynamics IT, SAIC, Peraton - these are all major defense contractors constantly hiring IT people with clearances.

**Companies actively hiring 25Bs right now:**

**Tech companies**: Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), Google (Cloud), IBM, Dell Technologies, HP, Cisco
**Defense contractors**: CACI, Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, General Dynamics, SAIC, Northrop Grumman
**Banks/Finance**: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One (big IT departments)
**Healthcare**: Major hospital systems need IT staff for electronic health records and infrastructure
**Government**: Federal agencies, state/local government IT departments

All of these actively recruit veterans and many have veteran hiring programs.

**Segment 3: Critical Certifications That Double Your Salary (5-6 minutes)**

Let me be very direct about this. [emphasis: "The right certifications can literally double your earning potential as a 25B transitioning to civilian IT."]

Here's your certification roadmap:

**Baseline Certifications (Get these while you're still in):**

**CompTIA A+** - This is entry-level, covers basic IT support. Cost: ~$250 per exam ($500 total for two-part exam).

Honestly, most 25Bs can skip this. You already have more experience than A+ requires. But if you want a baseline cert, it's an easy one to get.

**CompTIA Network+** - This covers networking fundamentals. Cost: ~$350 for the exam.

More valuable than A+. If you've worked on networks, this should be straightforward. It's respected in the industry and shows you understand networking concepts.

**CompTIA Security+** - This is critical for DOD contracting work. It's required by DOD 8570 for anyone working on DOD information systems in a security role. Cost: ~$392 for the exam.

Every 25B getting out should get Security+. Period. It's not optional if you want DOD contractor work, and it's valuable for civilian cybersecurity roles too.

**Mid-Level Certifications (Get these in your first 1-2 years civilian):**

**Microsoft Certifications:**
- **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate** - If you're going the cloud route. Cost: ~$165 per exam.
- **Microsoft 365 Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator Associate** - For systems administration. Cost: ~$165 per exam.

Microsoft certs are valuable because so many companies use Microsoft products. If you're managing Windows servers and Active Directory, Microsoft certs prove your skills.

**Cisco CCNA** - Cisco Certified Network Associate. This is the gold standard for networking. Cost: ~$300 for the exam.

CCNA proves you can configure and troubleshoot Cisco networking equipment. It's highly respected and can add $10K to $15K to your salary.

It's harder than CompTIA Network+, but it's worth it if you're serious about networking careers.

**AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** - This is for cloud engineering. Cost: ~$150 for the exam.

AWS is the largest cloud provider. This certification shows you can design and deploy AWS infrastructure. With this cert, you can get cloud engineering jobs starting at $90K+.

**Advanced Certifications (2-3 years in):**

**CISSP** - Certified Information Systems Security Professional. This is the top certification for cybersecurity. Cost: ~$749 for the exam.

You need 5 years of IT security experience to be fully certified (though you can take the exam earlier and become an Associate).

CISSP is expensive and difficult, but it's worth it. Security professionals with CISSP routinely make $100K to $140K+.

**AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional** - Advanced cloud certification. Cost: ~$300 for exam.

**Cisco CCNP** - Cisco Certified Network Professional. Advanced networking cert.

**Here's my recommended certification path for 25Bs:**

**While still in (12-18 months before separation):**
- CompTIA Security+ (absolute must for DOD work)
- CompTIA Network+ or start working on CCNA

**First civilian job (0-12 months):**
- If going cloud: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate or Azure Administrator
- If going networking: Complete CCNA
- If going security: Start studying for CISSP (take exam once you hit experience requirements)

**Years 2-3:**
- Add advanced certs in your chosen specialization
- CISSP for security professionals
- Professional-level cloud certs
- CCNP for network engineers

**Important:** Use your GI Bill benefits or military tuition assistance to pay for cert training courses if needed. Many certs you can self-study using free resources online, but structured courses can help if you need them.

**Segment 4: The Job Search Strategy (4-5 minutes)**

Let's talk about how to actually land these jobs.

**Strategy #1: Leverage your security clearance**

If you have an active clearance, lead with that. Put it prominently on your resume. Apply to DOD contractor positions that require clearances.

Your clearance is worth real money. Companies will pay more for cleared personnel because clearances take 6-18 months to process. If you already have one, you're immediately more valuable.

**Strategy #2: Use SkillBridge**

SkillBridge lets you work a civilian job during your last 180 days while still getting military pay. Tech companies participate in SkillBridge.

Imagine doing a 6-month internship as a systems administrator at Amazon Web Services while still getting your Army paycheck. Then when you separate, AWS offers you a full-time job. That's the power of SkillBridge.

**Strategy #3: Tailor your resume to civilian language**

Don't say "25B Information Technology Specialist, managed Army CPCE workstations."

Say "Systems Administrator, managed 200+ Windows workstations including installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and security implementation."

Translate everything to civilian terms. Hiring managers don't know what CPCE or ADPE or NIPRNET means. They need to understand your experience in language they recognize.

**Strategy #4: Apply to veteran-friendly companies**

Companies with veteran hiring programs actively recruit 25Bs:
- Amazon (has Military-to-Amazon program)
- Microsoft (has military hiring initiative)
- JP Morgan Chase (has Veterans Jobs Mission)
- USAA (heavily recruits veterans for IT roles)
- All major defense contractors

These companies understand military experience and have recruiters who specialize in veteran hiring.

**Strategy #5: Network on LinkedIn**

Find other 25Bs who've transitioned to civilian IT. Send them connection requests. Ask for 15-minute phone calls to learn about their transition.

Join LinkedIn groups for veterans in IT. Participate in discussions. Connect with recruiters who specialize in veteran hiring.

Your network will get you more job opportunities than applying cold online.

**Strategy #6: Consider starting with defense contracting**

DOD contractor jobs are often the easiest transition for 25Bs because:
- You already understand the environment
- Your clearance is required
- Your Army IT experience is directly applicable
- Pay is good ($70K to $120K+)

You can work as a contractor for 1-2 years, build your certifications and civilian experience, then transition to higher-paying private sector roles if you want.

**Segment 5: Your 12-Month Transition Roadmap (3-4 minutes)**

Here's your action plan:

**12 months out:**

Get Security+. Study for 2-3 months, take the exam, pass it. This is non-negotiable.

Start building your LinkedIn profile. Professional photo, detailed work history translated to civilian language, connect with other IT professionals.

**9 months out:**

Start your next certification - either CCNA, AWS Solutions Architect, or Azure Administrator depending on your career path choice.

Apply for SkillBridge positions. Research companies that participate and start reaching out.

**6 months out:**

Complete your second certification if possible.

Start applying to jobs even though you haven't separated yet. Put your separation date on your resume.

Update your resume with civilian language and quantified accomplishments.

**3-4 months out:**

If you got into SkillBridge, you're working your civilian internship now while still getting paid by the Army.

If not, continue applying and interviewing. Start networking heavily - reach out to veteran IT professionals, attend virtual job fairs, connect with recruiters.

**1-2 months out:**

Finalize job offers. Negotiate salary - don't just accept the first offer.

Calculate your terminal leave. You might have 60+ days of leave saved up. That's 60 days of getting paid by the Army while you start your civilian job or continue job hunting.

**Separation day:**

Ideally, you have a job offer in hand or you start within a few weeks.

If you used SkillBridge effectively, you might already be working at the company for 3-6 months and they're converting you to full-time.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap.

As a 25B, you have valuable IT experience that translates directly to civilian careers. Entry-level positions start at $60K-$70K. With certifications and experience, you can make $80K-$100K. Senior positions pay $120K-$160K+.

Career paths include systems administrator, network engineer, cybersecurity analyst, cloud engineer, and DevOps engineer. Defense contractors actively hire 25Bs with clearances for $70K-$120K+.

Critical certifications: Security+ (must-have), CCNA or cloud certs (AWS/Azure), and CISSP for cybersecurity careers. Get Security+ while you're still in, add others in your first 1-2 civilian years.

Use SkillBridge, leverage your clearance, translate your resume to civilian language, and network heavily on LinkedIn.
