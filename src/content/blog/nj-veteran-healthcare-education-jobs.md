# New Jersey Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

New Jersey operates two major VA medical centers—East Orange VA Medical Center and Lyons VA Medical Center—plus nine community-based outpatient clinics covering the densely populated state. East Orange serves Northern New Jersey and the NYC metro area, while Lyons provides specialty care including long-term care and geriatrics. With 11 total VA facilities, geographic access is better than most states, though wait times and quality ratings are mixed.

For education, Rutgers University (New Brunswick, Newark, Camden) accepts GI Bill benefits and participates in Yellow Ribbon with 105 undergraduate slots at $7,022 each annually. NJIT offers 7 Yellow Ribbon slots with unlimited tuition coverage. New Jersey's standout benefit is the National Guard tuition waiver—members can attend any NJ state college or university tuition-free for up to 16 credits per semester, covering both undergraduate and graduate studies. The Veterans Tuition Credit Program offers an additional $400/year for full-time students (though this is modest).

Employment is challenging, with New Jersey posting a 4.6% unemployment rate (January 2025)—7th worst in the nation. National veteran unemployment was 3.0% in 2024, but state-specific NJ veteran data shows the state struggles with job creation. However, the NYC/Philadelphia metro areas offer strong opportunities in pharmaceuticals (Merck, Johnson & Johnson), finance, healthcare, logistics (Port Newark), and federal contracting. State government jobs offer veteran hiring preference—qualified disabled veterans go to the top of employment lists.

Overall rating: **7/10** for healthcare access (good coverage, mixed quality), **8.5/10** for education benefits (strong GI Bill + National Guard waiver), **6/10** for employment (high unemployment but good industries).

### Outpatient Clinics

New Jersey has 9 community-based outpatient clinics providing primary care, mental health, and routine specialty care closer to home:

**Northern New Jersey:**

- **Hackensack VA Clinic**: Serves Bergen County and surrounding areas
- **Jersey City VA Clinic**: Serves Hudson County

- **Brick VA Clinic**: Serves Ocean County (Shore area)
- **Hamilton VA Clinic**: Serves Mercer County (Trenton area)

**Southern New Jersey:**

- **Tinton Falls VA Clinic**: Serves Monmouth County

These clinics reduce travel burden for veterans who don't need full medical center services. Most offer primary care, mental health counseling, lab work, pharmacy, and telehealth services.

### Vet Centers

Vet Centers provide confidential counseling for combat veterans, sexual trauma survivors, and bereaved families—separate from the VA medical system.

**Bloomfield Vet Center**
- Location: 2 Broad Street, Suite 703, Bloomfield, NJ 07003
- Phone: (973) 748-0980
- 24/7 Call Center: (877) 927-8387
- Hours: Monday-Friday 8am-6pm (call for evening/weekend appointments)
- Services: Individual/group counseling, PTSD treatment, MST therapy, family counseling, bereavement counseling, readjustment counseling

**Satellite/Outreach Locations:**

- Located right off Route 70W

**Crisis Support:** Call or text 988, then press 1 for Veterans Crisis Line (24/7 support, private, free).

Vet Centers are non-medical, community-based settings. Many veterans prefer them over VA hospitals for mental health care because they're less institutional, don't require VA enrollment, and focus solely on readjustment counseling and PTSD treatment.

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- Urban access (Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Trenton): Excellent—multiple facilities and clinics throughout metro areas
- Suburban access (Bergen, Morris, Middlesex, Monmouth counties): Good—clinics in most major suburban centers
- Rural access: Moderate—Sussex County has a clinic, but rural northwestern and southern NJ counties may require 30-60 minute drives to nearest VA facility

**Geographic Advantage:** New Jersey is small (8,723 square miles) and densely populated, meaning most veterans are within 30-45 minutes of a VA facility. This is significantly better than large Western states where rural veterans drive 2+ hours.

**Wait Times:** Wait times vary by facility and specialty. National VA data shows improvement (11% decrease in primary care wait times, 7% decrease in mental health wait times in 2024 vs. 2023), but individual experiences in New Jersey vary. East Orange, as one of the busiest facilities, can have longer waits for specialty care.

**Quality Concerns:** East Orange and Lyons have faced quality issues and scandals in the past (2015-2018 investigations into patient care). Improvements have been made, but some veterans report ongoing frustrations with scheduling, communication, and quality. Always advocate for yourself and escalate concerns to Patient Advocates.

**Areas for improvement:** Wait times for specialty care, communication between departments, customer service at some locations.

### Community Care (Non-VA Options)

If the VA can't provide timely care, you may be eligible for Community Care (formerly Veterans Choice Program):

- **Eligibility:** If you live 40+ miles from a VA facility (rare in NJ), wait times exceed VA standards (28 days for primary care, 20 days for specialty care), or VA doesn't offer the service you need
- **Process:** Your VA provider submits a Community Care referral; VA authorizes care at a civilian provider
- **Cost:** Covered by VA (you may have copays depending on your eligibility)

New Jersey has extensive Community Care networks in every county. Major hospital systems include:
- **Northern NJ:** Hackensack Meridian Health, RWJBarnabas Health, Atlantic Health System
- **Central NJ:** RWJBarnabas, Virtua Health
- **Southern NJ:** Cooper University Health Care, Inspira Health, AtlantiCare

**TRICARE (for retirees):** If you're a military retiree under 65, you may have TRICARE coverage. New Jersey has excellent TRICARE network availability in urban and suburban areas. TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select both have strong networks with major hospital systems.

## Education Benefits

### Top GI Bill Schools

**Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey**

Rutgers has three campuses (New Brunswick, Newark, Camden) and is New Jersey's flagship public university. All three campuses accept GI Bill benefits and participate in Yellow Ribbon.

**Rutgers University - New Brunswick**
- Location: New Brunswick, NJ
- Veteran enrollment: 1,000+ using VA/military benefits across all campuses
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes—approximately 105 undergraduate students at $7,022 each per year
- BAH Rate (2024-25): ~$2,550/month (E-5 with dependents, in-person, NYC metro rate applies); ~$1,119/month (online only)
- In-state tuition: ~$15,900/year | Out-of-state: ~$33,700/year
- GI Bill coverage: 100% in-state with Post-9/11 GI Bill; out-of-state students may have gap if Yellow Ribbon unavailable ($33,700 - $29,920.95 cap = ~$3,780 gap)
- Yellow Ribbon contribution: $7,022 from Rutgers + $7,022 from VA = $14,044 total
- Graduation rate: 84% (6-year)
- Popular programs: Business, engineering, pharmacy, nursing, computer science, criminal justice, psychology
- Veteran services: Office of Veteran and Military Programs and Services (OVMPS), VA certifying officials, veterans lounge, student veteran organizations on all campuses

**Rutgers-Newark**
- Location: Newark, NJ (urban campus)
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes
- Graduation rate: 70%
- Popular programs: Business (Rutgers Business School), criminal justice, nursing, accounting

**Rutgers-Camden**
- Location: Camden, NJ (across from Philadelphia)
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes
- Graduation rate: 72%
- Popular programs: Business, law (Rutgers Law School), nursing, social work

**In-State Tuition for Veterans:** For courses beginning after July 1, 2017, public institutions in New Jersey must charge qualifying veterans, dependents, and eligible individuals tuition and fees at the rate for in-state residents. This means if you use Post-9/11 GI Bill, you pay in-state rates even if you're not a NJ resident.

Rutgers is an excellent choice for veterans in New Jersey. The Yellow Ribbon program has 105 slots, so apply early. Rutgers' location near NYC provides internship and job opportunities in finance, pharmaceuticals, and tech. The Newark campus puts you in the heart of New Jersey's business district.

**New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**
- Location: Newark, NJ (adjacent to Rutgers-Newark)
- Veteran enrollment: 200+ using VA/military benefits
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes—7 students per year with **unlimited tuition benefit**
- BAH Rate: ~$2,550/month (Newark, NYC metro rate)
- In-state tuition: ~$18,300/year | Out-of-state: ~$35,900/year
- GI Bill coverage: 100% in-state; Yellow Ribbon covers full out-of-state gap for 7 students
- Graduation rate: 72%
- Popular programs: Engineering (mechanical, electrical, civil, computer), computer science, architecture, cybersecurity, information systems
- Veteran services: Veteran and Military-Affiliated Student Services, application fee waivers for eligible veterans, credit for military training
- Contact: Ms. Allison Babinski, Babinski@njit.edu

NJIT's Yellow Ribbon program is extremely generous for the 7 students who get it—unlimited tuition coverage. However, with only 7 slots, competition is intense. NJIT is a top-tier engineering school, ideal for veterans targeting STEM careers. The Newark location provides access to NYC and New Jersey's tech sector.

**Montclair State University**
- Location: Montclair, NJ
- Veteran enrollment: 200+
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes (limited slots)
- In-state tuition: ~$14,500/year
- Programs: Education, business, communication, psychology, nursing
- Veteran services: Veterans Resource Center

**The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)**

- Veteran enrollment: 100+
- Yellow Ribbon: Limited participation
- In-state tuition: ~$16,700/year
- Programs: Education, business, engineering, nursing
- Known for excellent teaching programs

**Rowan University**
- Location: Glassboro, NJ (South Jersey)
- Veteran enrollment: 300+
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes
- In-state tuition: ~$14,400/year
- Programs: Engineering, education, business, osteopathic medicine

### State Education Benefits

**Veterans Tuition Credit Program**

New Jersey offers partial tuition reimbursement for veterans attending NJ colleges:

- **Benefit:** Up to $400 per year for full-time students, $200 per year for part-time students
- **Eligibility:** Honorably discharged veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces and were legal residents of New Jersey at the time of entry into service
- **How it works:** Reimbursement after completing coursework—not a waiver
- **Limitations:** Must be attending a NJ public or private institution

**Honest assessment:** $400/year is modest—it covers about 2-3 credit hours at a community college or 1 credit hour at a university. It's helpful but not a game-changer. Most veterans will rely primarily on GI Bill.

**New Jersey National Guard Tuition Waiver**

This is New Jersey's standout state benefit for active Guard members:

- **Eligibility:** Active drilling members of New Jersey Army or Air National Guard
- **Benefit:** Up to 16 credits per semester tuition-free at any New Jersey state college or university
- **Coverage:** Undergraduate and graduate studies
- **Excluded programs:** Law, medical, and dental schools not eligible
- **Limitations:** Does not cover fees, books, or cost of materials (but you can use GI Bill, Pell Grants, or scholarships for these)
- **Requirements:** Must maintain satisfactory academic progress; must be in good standing with unit; must apply for financial aid each year
- **How it works:** Other aid (GI Bill, Pell, scholarships) applied first; tuition waiver covers any remaining tuition
- **Value:** $15,900/year at Rutgers, $18,300/year at NJIT—over 4 years, that's $63,600-$73,200 in savings

**Example:** You're in the NJ Air National Guard attending Rutgers. Tuition is $15,900/year. You use Post-9/11 GI Bill, which covers up to $29,920.95 (more than enough). The Guard waiver doesn't apply because GI Bill already covered tuition. BUT you pocket the full BAH ($2,550/month x 9 = $22,950/year) plus book stipend ($1,000). This makes college completely free with surplus cash.

If you're attending part-time or don't use GI Bill, the Guard waiver covers your tuition directly—no out-of-pocket cost.

### Community Colleges

New Jersey's community colleges are affordable and fully accept GI Bill:

**Bergen Community College (Paramus)**

All New Jersey community colleges accept GI Bill, offer National Guard tuition waiver, and have VA certifying officials. Tuition is low enough ($4,500-$5,600/year) that GI Bill recipients pocket significant BAH surplus. Strong transfer agreements with Rutgers, NJIT, and other universities.

### Trade Schools & Certifications

- Fees: $800/year (estimate)

- **Total GI Bill value:** $26,800/year

**Out-of-pocket:** $0—you'll have $19,000+ extra BAH to cover living expenses or save.

## Employment & Career Resources

### Veteran Unemployment Rate

- New Jersey overall unemployment: 4.6% (January 2025)—7th worst in the nation
- National veteran unemployment: 3.0% (2024 average)
- New Jersey veteran unemployment: State-specific data not readily available, but NJ's high overall unemployment suggests veterans also face challenges

**Reality check:** New Jersey's unemployment is consistently above the national average. The state's economy is diversified (pharmaceuticals, finance, logistics, healthcare, retail) but job creation lags. The NYC and Philadelphia metro areas offer strong opportunities, but competition is fierce. Housing costs and property taxes also make NJ challenging for job seekers.

### State Veteran Employment Programs

**New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development - Veteran Services**

- **Priority of Service:** All veterans and eligible spouses receive priority for job placement, training programs, and employment services at One-Stop Career Centers
- **Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP):** One-on-one employment services for eligible veterans with barriers to employment
- **Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVER):** Work with employers to recruit veterans
- **Job Search Workshops:** Resume preparation, application procedures, interviewing skills
- **One-Stop Career Centers:** Located throughout New Jersey, provide job search assistance, career counseling, assessment services

**Contact:** NJ Department of Labor & Workforce Development Veteran Services | https://www.nj.gov/labor/career-services/special-services/veterans/

**American Job Centers:** Located in every county, offer computers, internet access, job boards, workshops, and one-on-one assistance.

### Veteran Hiring Preference

**State Jobs:**

New Jersey statute provides veteran hiring preference for state civil service positions:

- **Disabled Veterans:** Placed at the top of open competitive employment lists above all other candidates
- **Veterans:** Qualified veterans are placed at the top of open competitive employment lists behind only disabled veterans but ahead of all non-veterans, regardless of exam scores
- **Eligibility:** Honorably discharged veterans who served during qualifying war eras
- **Spouse Preference:** The spouse of a disabled veteran is entitled to the same preference as the disabled veteran (disabled veteran must waive preference)

**How it works:** When you apply for a state job with a scored exam, your veteran status adds significant preference to your final ranking. Disabled veterans go to the absolute top of the list.

**How to apply:**
1. Visit njjobs.nj.gov and filter for state civil service positions
2. File a Civil Service Veterans Preference Claim Form with NJ Department of Military & Veterans Affairs
3. Submit DD Form 214 and disability documentation (if applicable)
4. Preference can be established as late as 8 days prior to employment list being issued

**Recent Expansion:** Bill A259, signed into law in January 2022, expanded veteran preference eligibility.

**County/Local Government:** Many counties and municipalities offer similar veteran preference (e.g., 5 points for veterans, 10 points for disabled veterans). Check with specific county/town HR departments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to get a VA appointment in New Jersey?**

A: Primary care wait times at East Orange and Lyons vary by season—typically 2-4 weeks. Specialty care may take 4-8 weeks. If wait times exceed VA standards (28 days primary, 20 days specialty), request Community Care. Use the 24/7 Nurse Advice Line for urgent medical advice.

**Q: Can I use my GI Bill at community colleges in New Jersey?**

A: Yes. All New Jersey community colleges (Bergen, Middlesex, Camden, Essex, Ocean, Morris, etc.) are GI Bill approved. You'll receive full tuition coverage plus BAH. With low tuition ($4,500-$5,600/year), you'll pocket significant BAH surplus.

**Q: Does the National Guard tuition waiver cover room and board?**

A: No. It covers tuition only (excludes fees, books, room, board). However, you can stack it with GI Bill, Pell Grants, and scholarships. If you use GI Bill, you'll get BAH to cover living expenses while the waiver or GI Bill covers tuition.

**Q: Can I use the National Guard tuition waiver and GI Bill together?**

A: Yes, but the waiver applies after other aid. If GI Bill covers your full tuition, the waiver won't apply (GI Bill is used first). You'd still get BAH and book stipend from GI Bill. If you attend part-time or don't use GI Bill, the waiver covers tuition directly.

**Q: I'm separating from Joint Base MDL. Where do I start for job help?**

A: Start with Transition Assistance Program (TAP) at JBMDL, then connect with New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development Veteran Services and your county Veteran Service Officer. One-Stop Career Centers offer job search assistance, resume help, and connections to employers actively hiring veterans.

**Q: How do I claim veteran hiring preference for state jobs?**

A: When you apply via njjobs.nj.gov, file a Civil Service Veterans Preference Claim Form with the NJ Department of Military & Veterans Affairs. Submit your DD-214 and disability documentation (if applicable). Preference can be established up to 8 days before the employment list is issued.

**Q: Is there VA dental care in New Jersey?**

A: Yes, but only for veterans with service-connected dental conditions, 100% disabled veterans, or those enrolled in specific programs. Dental is available at East Orange VAMC and Lyons VAMC.

**Q: What if I need specialty care not available at NJ VA facilities?**

A: Your VA provider can refer you to Community Care, allowing you to see a civilian specialist at facilities like Hackensack Meridian Health, RWJBarnabas, or AtlantiCare. The VA covers the cost (you may have copays depending on eligibility).

**Q: Can I transfer my GI Bill to my kids and still use the NJ National Guard waiver?**

A: If you're in the NJ National Guard, your child could use transferred GI Bill for BAH/books and you could use the Guard waiver for tuition (though typically one or the other will cover tuition fully). They're separate programs.

**Q: Does Rutgers' Yellow Ribbon program have unlimited slots?**

A: No. Rutgers offers approximately 105 undergraduate Yellow Ribbon slots at $7,022 each per year. This is limited and not guaranteed. Apply early. NJIT offers 7 slots with unlimited tuition coverage (even more competitive).

**Q: I'm rated 90% disabled. Do I qualify for anything special in New Jersey?**

A: You qualify for Priority Group 1 VA healthcare, federal hiring preference, and possibly VR&E (vocational rehab). New Jersey doesn't have unique state benefits for 90% rated veterans beyond full property tax exemption (requires 100% P&T).

**Q: What's the best city in New Jersey for veterans?**

A: Depends on priorities. Jersey City offers urban amenities, NYC access, and VA clinic. Edison (Middlesex County) offers suburban living, good schools, and proximity to Piscataway VA clinic. Trenton area (Hamilton) offers affordability, state government jobs with veteran preference, and Hamilton VA clinic. See our Best Cities guide for full analysis.
