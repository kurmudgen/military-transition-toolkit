# Terminal Leave Guide: How to Maximize Your Final Military Days (2025)

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Terminal leave = using your accrued leave at the end to get out early.** You leave active duty but keep getting paid. **Example:** Have 60 days leave, ETS June 30. Take terminal leave May 1-June 30. Out of work May 1, but paid through June 30. That's your ramp-down time. **Key: Use terminal leave intentionally—moving, job hunting, family time, not Netflix.** This is your gift. Use it wisely.

**Most veterans waste terminal leave. Don't be one of them.**

## What Is Terminal Leave

### How It Works

**Terminal Leave = Using Leave to Shorten Your Active Duty**

**Example:**
- Your ETS date: June 30
- You have 60 days of accrued leave
- You take terminal leave May 1-June 30 (60 days)
- You're no longer "on duty" May 1
- But you're still getting paid through June 30
- Your official ETS is still June 30
- You've basically gotten 2 months off while paid

**In your paycheck:**
- May 1-June 30: Full paycheck as if you were working
- This is money you've earned; you're just using it at the end

### Leave vs. Terminal Leave

**Regular Leave:**
- You take a week off, still get paid that week
- You come back to work after
- You used 5 days of leave

**Terminal Leave:**
- You take your remaining leave all at once at the end
- You don't come back to work
- You're officially out of the military at ETS
- You've used all your leave to shorten active duty

### How Much Leave You Likely Have

**Military accumulates leave:**
- 2.5 days per month (Army/Marine Corps)
- 2.5 days per month (Navy)
- Varies slightly by branch

**Over a career:**
- 4 years: ~120 days
- 6 years: ~180 days
- 10 years: ~300 days
- 20 years: ~600 days

**Maximum you can "use" is usually 60-120 days before ETS. Rest is lost or paid out.**

## Terminal Leave Strategy

### Know Your Rules

**Before taking terminal leave, know your command's rules:**
- [ ] How much terminal leave can you take?
- [ ] When must you submit request?
- [ ] Can your command deny it? (Rarely, legally protected)
- [ ] What's the process?
- [ ] Do you keep access to base during terminal leave? (Depends, but usually no for regular access)

**Key rule:** You're entitled to terminal leave if you want it. Commands can't deny you (legally).

**Some commands pressure you:**
- "We need you through June 30"
- "Take terminal leave in January, stay with us till June"
- "You can sell it back instead"

**Reality:** You have rights. Use terminal leave if you want. They can't make you stay.

### Planning Your Terminal Leave

**Ideal timeline:**
- Month 12 before ETS: Know you're getting out
- Month 9 before ETS: Decide when to start terminal leave
- Month 6 before ETS: Submit terminal leave request to command
- Month 3 before ETS: Confirm approval, start planning
- Month 2 before ETS: Begin out-processing
- Terminal leave month: Execute plan, move, transition

### Ideal Terminal Leave Duration

**Recommendation: 60-90 days**

**Why 60-90 days:**
- That's 2-3 months to handle transition
- Enough time to move/find housing
- Enough time to interview for jobs (slow process)
- Enough time to mentally prepare
- Not so long you go crazy from boredom
- Not too short that you're overwhelmed

**If you have less than 60 days leave:** Take what you have. It's still useful.

**If you have more than 90 days:** Sell the rest or donate to leave bank (varies by branch). You probably can't use it all.

## What to Do During Terminal Leave (Don't Waste It)

### Don't Do This

**Mistake 1: Binge Netflix/video games all day**
- Yes, you've earned rest
- Yes, recovery is important
- But 2-3 months of this is soul-crushing
- You'll regret it mentally

**Mistake 2: Take it "just in case" and not plan**
- You're on terminal leave, no plan
- Panic sets in
- You end up wasting time

**Mistake 3: Travel without purpose**
- Taking random trips instead of focusing on transition
- You need this time for serious transition tasks

**Mistake 4: Ignore out-processing**
- Terminal leave doesn't mean you skip out-processing
- You still have medical exams, paperwork, etc.
- Plan around it

### DO This (Smart Terminal Leave Uses)

**Priority 1: Out-Processing (Month 1-2 of terminal leave)**
- Medical exams/appointments
- Finance review (final pay, travel vouchers)
- Personnel (DD-214, official records)
- CIF turn-in (gear)
- Housing clearance
- ID card turn-in/replacement
- Transportation/moving

**This takes 6-8 weeks if you're organized, 12+ weeks if disorganized.**

**Priority 2: Moving (Month 1-2 of terminal leave)**
- Find new housing (if moving)
- Arrange movers
- Pack
- Physically move
- Set up utilities
- Unpack essentials

**Priority 3: Job Hunting (Throughout terminal leave)**
- Interviews for jobs (they happen throughout)
- Final push on job applications
- Accept job offer
- Prepare for first day

**Priority 4: Family Time (Mixed throughout)**
- Quality time with kids
- Take family on trip (one trip, not multiple)
- Settle into new location
- Help kids transition
- Spend time with spouse

**Priority 5: Mental/Physical Prep (Throughout)**
- Therapy/counseling (start here if needed)
- Fitness (maintain routine)
- Reading/learning about career
- Meditation/reflection
- Journal/process emotions

**Priority 6: Rest (Last month)**
- By last month, mostly done with transition
- Actually rest then
- Recovery from busy 2 months
- Mental prep for civilian life

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to take terminal leave?**
A: No, but it's a good idea. Alternative is leaving early with leftover leave that gets paid out or lost.

**Q: Can my command make me stay instead of terminal leave?**
A: No. You're entitled to terminal leave. They can pressure but can't legally force you.

**Q: What if my command says I can't take terminal leave?**
A: Escalate to higher command or chaplain. This is a legal right.

**Q: Do I get paid for terminal leave?**
A: Yes, you get full paycheck for days in terminal leave (as if you were working).

**Q: What happens if I get a job offer before terminal leave?**
A: You can usually start job during terminal leave (employers understand military transition). You'll be working civilian job while on terminal leave (and getting paid by military). Eventually military pay ends, civilian pay continues.

**Q: Can I sell my leave instead of taking it?**
A: Rules vary by branch. Some allow selling unused leave, some don't. Check with your branch.

**Q: What if I don't use all my leave?**
A: Usually lost (some branches have leave carryover limits). Better to use it than lose it.

**Q: Should I plan a vacation during terminal leave?**
A: One vacation yes (relaxation). But not multiple vacations. You need focus time for transition.

## Bottom Line

**Terminal leave is your gift from military. Don't waste it.** Use it for out-processing, moving, job hunting, and family time. Month 1-2 will be busy. Month 3 can be rest. By end of terminal leave, you should be fully transitioned to civilian life.

**Pro tip:** Treat terminal leave like a project. Make a plan. Execute it. You'll emerge on the other side successfully transitioned instead of scrambling in month 6.
