# How to Use Your VA Home Loan to Buy a House: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The VA home loan is one of the best homebuying benefits available, with zero down payment, no PMI, and competitive interest rates. However, most veterans don't fully understand the benefit and overpay or qualify for less than possible. This guide shows you how to leverage your VA home loan to buy a house, navigate the process, and maximize this $235,000+ benefit.

## Understanding the VA Home Loan Benefit

### What Is the VA Home Loan?

The VA doesn't lend money. Instead, the VA guarantees loans made by private lenders (banks, credit unions, mortgage companies), which allows:

- **Zero Down Payment** - Buy home with $0 down
- **No PMI** - No mortgage insurance (saves $200-400/month)
- **Competitive Rates** - Often lower rates than conventional loans
- **Flexible Credit** - Loan available with lower credit scores (580+)
- **No Prepayment Penalty** - Pay off early without penalty

### Loan Amount You Can Borrow

**2024 VA Loan Limits by Location:**

| Location Type | Max Loan Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Tier 1 (most counties) | $766,550 |
| Tier 2 (HCOL areas) | $1,149,825 |
| Tier 3 (California, Hawaii, etc.) | $1,533,100 |

**Key Point:** You can borrow more than the limit if you put down additional funds. Example: If limit is $766,550 and house is $900,000, you can borrow $766,550 and put down $133,450.

## Step 1: Determine Your VA Loan Eligibility

**Who's Eligible for VA Home Loan:**

- Active Duty: 181+ days of continuous service
- Reserves/National Guard: 6 years of service
- Honorable Discharge: Required (or general discharge with no dishonorable conduct)
- Surviving Spouses: Can use if service member died in service or from service-connected disability

**Check Your Eligibility:**

1. Go to VA.gov
2. Log in with eBenefits/VA account
3. View your Certificate of Eligibility (COE)
4. Or request COE if you don't have one

**What You Need for COE:**
- DD-214 discharge papers
- Social Security number
- Name and date of birth

## Step 2: Get Pre-Approved (Week 1-2)

Pre-approval shows sellers you're serious and tells you how much you can borrow.

**Pre-Approval Process:**

### Step 2A: Gather Documents

**Standard Documents Needed:**
- 2 most recent pay stubs
- 2 most recent tax returns (prior 2 years)
- Bank statements (checking and savings, 2 months)
- Proof of employment (offer letter if new job)
- List of debts/monthly obligations
- Certificate of Eligibility (COE)

**If Self-Employed or Changing Jobs:**
- 2 years tax returns (showing business income)
- Profit and loss statement
- Employment verification letter
- Documentation of job change (offer letter for new position)

### Step 2B: Choose VA Mortgage Lender

Options for VA mortgage lenders:

1. **Banks** - Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC, etc.
2. **Credit Unions** - Often better rates for members
3. **VA Mortgage Specialists** - Specialize in VA loans
4. **Online Lenders** - Better rates sometimes, less personal service

**How to Compare:**

| Factor | Bank A | Bank B | Bank C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interest Rate | 6.5% | 6.25% | 6.4% |
| Origination Fee | 1.0% | 1.25% | 0.75% |
| Other Fees | $500 | $800 | $300 |
| Total Cost | High | Medium | Lowest |

**Shopping Tip:** Get quotes from 3-5 lenders. Interest rate difference of 0.5% saves you $100/month on $250K loan.

### Step 2C: Submit Pre-Approval Application

Lender will:
1. Verify employment
2. Run credit report (impact: 5-10 points)
3. Review assets and debts
4. Calculate maximum loan amount
5. Issue pre-approval letter

**Pre-Approval Letter Shows:**
- Maximum loan amount
- Estimated interest rate
- Monthly payment estimate
- Valid for 120 days

**Pre-Approval Timeline:** 3-5 business days

## Step 3: Find and Make Offer on Property (Weeks 2-4)

Pre-approval in hand, you can now shop for homes.

**Home Shopping Considerations:**

### Consider Your Maximum Loan Amount

**Example Pre-Approval:**
- Pre-approved for: $300,000
- Down payment savings: $40,000
- Maximum purchase price: $340,000

**Don't Stretch to Maximum:** Just because you can borrow $300K doesn't mean you should. Leave room for:
- Emergency savings (3-6 months expenses)
- Closing costs (even with VA loan, ~$2K-$5K)
- Future maintenance (home repairs)
- Life flexibility (job change, family needs)

**Conservative Approach:**
- Borrow 75-80% of max approval
- Save down payment for closing costs/reserves
- Leaves financial flexibility

### Hire a Real Estate Agent

**What to Look For:**
- Experience with VA loans (not all agents understand them)
- Local market knowledge
- Positive reviews/referrals
- Responsive communication

**What Agent Should Explain:**
- Market conditions (buyer vs. seller market)
- Pricing comparable homes
- Negotiation strategy
- Inspection and appraisal process

### Make Offer on Property

Once you find property:

1. **Make Written Offer**
   - Proposed price
   - Contingencies (inspection, appraisal, VA approval)
   - Earnest money deposit ($500-2,000)
   - Closing timeline (typically 30-45 days)

2. **Standard Contingencies for VA Loan:**
   - VA appraisal approval (property must meet standards)
   - Home inspection (find defects/issues)
   - Financing contingency (loan approval)

3. **Negotiate Terms**
   - Price
   - Seller paying closing costs (common with VA loans)
   - Repair agreements from inspection
   - Closing date

## Step 4: Appraisal and Inspection (Weeks 4-5)

After offer is accepted, two parallel processes begin.

### VA Appraisal

**What Is VA Appraisal?**
- Independent evaluation of property value
- Ensures you're not overpaying
- Confirms property meets VA standards
- Required by VA lender

**VA Appraisal Standards:**
Property must be:
- Safe and sound (no major defects)
- Sanitary (working water, sewer, heating)
- Structurally adequate (roof, foundation, walls solid)
- Livable (not condemned or unsafe)

**What Fails VA Appraisal:**
- Major roof damage
- Foundation issues
- No working heat source
- Mold or severe water damage
- Lead paint hazards (built pre-1978)
- Unpermitted additions
- Septic systems in poor condition

**If Appraisal Comes in Lower Than Offer Price:**
- Options: Renegotiate price down, pay difference at closing, or walk away
- VA won't loan more than appraised value

**VA Appraisal Timeline:** 7-14 days

### Home Inspection

**What Is Home Inspection?**
- Professional inspector evaluates home condition
- Identifies defects, needed repairs, maintenance issues
- Provides written report
- Different from appraisal (appraisal = value, inspection = condition)

**Inspector Checks:**
- Roof condition
- Foundation/structural integrity
- HVAC (heating/cooling) system
- Plumbing (water damage, leaks)
- Electrical (safe, code-compliant)
- Pest damage (termites, etc.)
- Insulation and ventilation
- Kitchen and bathroom
- Any visible defects

**What to Do with Inspection Results:**
1. Review report
2. Prioritize repairs (major vs. minor)
3. Negotiate repair responsibility (you or seller)
4. Get repair estimates for major items
5. Decide: accept as-is, request repairs, or renegotiate price

**Home Inspection Timeline:** 7-14 days (scheduled during inspection period)

## Step 5: Finalize Financing (Week 5-6)

Once appraisal and inspection are done, finalize loan.

### Clear to Close Checklist

Lender will verify:
- [ ] Appraisal meets VA standards and supports loan amount
- [ ] Home inspection complete (no unexpected issues)
- [ ] Title search completed (no liens or ownership issues)
- [ ] Homeowners insurance quotes obtained
- [ ] Final walkthrough done (property condition unchanged)
- [ ] All documents signed
- [ ] Earnest money transferred
- [ ] Final funds ready for closing

### VA Funding Fee

**What Is Funding Fee?**
- Fee paid to VA (not VA, but lender collects it)
- Protects VA loan program
- Can be financed into loan amount

**2024 Funding Fee Rates:**

| Situation | Funding Fee |
|---|---|
| First-time VA loan, no down payment | 2.3% |
| First-time VA loan, 5%+ down payment | 1.63% |
| First-time VA loan, 10%+ down payment | 1.23% |
| Subsequent VA loans, no down payment | 3.6% |
| Disabled veteran (50%+, rated) | No funding fee |
| Purple Heart recipient | No funding fee |

**Example:**
- Loan amount: $250,000
- Funding fee (2.3%): $5,750
- Total loan including funding fee: $255,750

**Important:** Some lenders/sellers will cover funding fee. Negotiate!

## Step 6: Final Walkthrough and Closing (Week 6-7)

### Final Walkthrough

1-2 days before closing:
- Walk through property
- Confirm condition is as expected
- Verify all negotiated repairs were completed
- Check that seller has vacated

### Closing Process

**At Closing:**

1. **Sign Documents** (lots of them)
   - Mortgage note (promise to repay)
   - Deed of trust (lender's claim on property)
   - Closing disclosure (all terms and costs)
   - Title transfer documents
   - Insurance documents
   - Various lender forms

2. **Bring ID and Payment**
   - Government-issued ID
   - Cashier's check or bank wire (closing costs/down payment if any)
   - Don't bring personal checks

3. **Closing Costs**

**Typical Closing Costs (VA Loan):**

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Appraisal | $400-$600 |
| Title search/insurance | $500-$1,000 |
| Recording fees | $100-$300 |
| Attorney/closing agent | $300-$800 |
| Property taxes (prorated) | $200-$500 (depends on property) |
| Insurance (first year premium) | $800-$1,500 |
| **Total | $2,300-$4,700 |

**Note:** With VA loans, seller often covers closing costs. Negotiate this in purchase agreement.

4. **Fund the Loan**
   - Lender wires money to title company
   - Earnest money applied to down payment/closing costs
   - You may need to bring cashier's check if costs exceed earnest money

5. **Get Keys**
   - Once all documents signed and funds transferred
   - You're now the homeowner!

**Closing Timeline:** 1-2 hours

## Step 7: Loan Servicing (After Closing)

**After Closing:**

1. **First Mortgage Payment**
   - Due 30 days after closing
   - Lender will provide payment instructions
   - Set up autopay (recommended)

2. **Monthly Payment Includes:**
   - Principal (paying down loan balance)
   - Interest (cost of borrowing)
   - Property taxes (usually escrowed)
   - Homeowners insurance (usually escrowed)
   - HOA fees (if applicable)

3. **Stay Current on Payments**
   - Late payments damage credit
   - Missed payments can lead to foreclosure
   - Set up autopay to prevent missing payments
