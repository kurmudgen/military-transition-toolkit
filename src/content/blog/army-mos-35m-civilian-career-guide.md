## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 35M Human Intelligence Collectors transitioning out—you have some of the most specialized and sought-after skills in the intelligence community. Your **source recruitment and handling, tactical questioning, debriefing operations, elicitation techniques, screening operations, advanced interview methodologies, threat assessment from human sources, and ability to operate independently in high-risk environments** make you extremely valuable to federal agencies and defense contractors. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$90,000-$130,000** with federal intelligence agencies or defense contractors, scaling to **$140,000-$200,000** with mid-career CIA/DIA operations officer positions or senior contractor roles, and **$200,000-$300,000+** for specialized HUMINT operations overseas or CIA Ground Branch positions. Your TS/SCI clearance with operational HUMINT experience is worth **$30,000-$50,000** in salary premium.

As a 35M, you didn't just "talk to people." You recruited and managed human intelligence sources in operational environments. You conducted tactical questioning of detainees, refugees, and local populations. You screened personnel for security threats. You debriefed friendly forces and coalition partners. You conducted liaison operations with foreign military and intelligence services. You operated in denied areas with minimal supervision. You assessed source credibility and motivation. You produced HUMINT intelligence reports that directly influenced operations. That's human intelligence operations, source management, interrogation expertise, cultural intelligence, and high-risk decision-making—all directly applicable to CIA operations officer, FBI special agent, defense HUMINT contractor, and federal intelligence careers.

The critical advantage: 35M training is nearly identical to CIA Operations Officer training. You've already done what CIA trains people for 18+ months to do. CIA Directorate of Operations, Ground Branch, Defense Human Intelligence Service, FBI counterintelligence, and defense HUMINT contractors all actively recruit 35Ms. Your operational HUMINT experience is the hardest skill to teach and the most valuable in the intelligence community.

## What Does a 35M Human Intelligence Collector Do?

As a 35M, you collected human intelligence through source operations, tactical questioning, debriefing, elicitation, and liaison activities. You recruited, vetted, and managed human sources to collect intelligence on enemy forces, threat groups, and local populations. You conducted tactical questioning of detainees and persons of interest to gain intelligence on enemy tactics, locations, and intentions. You screened personnel for security threats, conducted debriefings of friendly forces returning from operations, and performed liaison with foreign military and intelligence personnel.

Your responsibilities included planning and executing HUMINT collection operations, writing intelligence information reports (IIRs), conducting source validation and credibility assessments, managing source networks, providing HUMINT support to tactical and strategic operations, advising commanders on human intelligence threats and opportunities, and operating in austere, high-risk environments with limited oversight. You worked with interpreters, managed source meetings, conducted surveillance detection, and maintained operational security.

This role required interpersonal skills, cultural awareness, critical thinking, interrogation expertise, report writing, source psychology understanding, judgment under pressure, ability to operate independently, language skills (for some), and absolute discretion with sensitive source operations.

## Top Civilian Career Paths for 35M HUMINT Collectors

### CIA Operations Officer & Directorate of Operations (perfect mission alignment)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Operations Officer (CIA Directorate of Operations)
- Collection Management Officer
- Targeting Officer
- Reports Officer
- Paramilitary Operations Officer (Ground Branch)
- Staff Operations Officer

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level Operations Officer (GS-10 to GS-12):** $70,000-$110,000 base
- **Mid-career (GS-12 to GS-14):** $90,000-$140,000 base
- **Senior Operations Officer (GS-14 to GS-15):** $120,000-$165,000 base
- **Plus:** Overseas allowances ($20K-$60K annually), danger pay ($10K-$40K), language bonuses ($5K-$25K)
- **Total compensation overseas in high-threat posts:** $150,000-$250,000+
- **Ground Branch (high-risk paramilitary operations):** $150,000-$300,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Source recruitment and handling (EXACTLY what CIA Operations Officers do)
- Tactical questioning and debriefing
- Operating in denied areas with minimal support
- Liaison with foreign services
- Cultural operations and language skills
- Report writing and intelligence production
- Your TS/SCI clearance
- Operational experience in Iraq/Afghanistan/etc.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required—use GI Bill if you don't have one)
- **TS/SCI clearance** (you have this—maintain it)
- **Full-scope polygraph** (lifestyle poly—be completely honest)
- **Language skills** (critical languages increase competitiveness: Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Farsi, etc.)
- **CIA training** (18-24 months provided after hiring—Operations Officer training course)

**Reality check:**
You are EXACTLY who CIA wants for Operations Officer positions. Your 35M experience is the closest military equivalent to CIA case officer work. You've already recruited sources, handled agents, operated in hostile environments, and produced intelligence—skills that take CIA 18-24 months to train.

Application to start date: 12-24 months (sometimes longer). Process includes extensive background investigation, full-scope polygraph, medical/psychological evaluation, and security clearance adjudication.

CIA Ground Branch (Special Activities Center) recruits former SOF and HUMINT operators for covert direct action and sensitive operations. Pay is higher ($150K-$300K+), risk is extreme, and you're doing paramilitary operations as a civilian GS employee. They actively want 35M backgrounds with SOF experience.

Not all CIA positions require extensive overseas work. Staff positions and headquarters roles exist with normal work-life balance, though Operations Officers should expect 60-70% of career overseas (often in hardship posts).

The mission is continuing what you did in the military—recruiting sources, collecting intelligence on threats to US national security—but at the strategic level, often unilaterally in denied areas without military support. If you loved the 35M mission, CIA is the natural progression.

**Best for:** 35M collectors who loved source operations, want to continue HUMINT at strategic level, are willing to work overseas extensively, and want to operate at the highest levels of human intelligence.

### FBI Counterintelligence & Intelligence Operations (domestic HUMINT mission)

**Civilian job titles:**
- FBI Special Agent (Counterintelligence Division)
- FBI Intelligence Analyst
- FBI Human Intelligence Operations
- FBI Confidential Informant Coordinator

**Salary ranges:**
- **FBI Special Agent (GS-10 start):** $78,000-$105,000 + 25% LEAP = $97,000-$131,000
- **Experienced Special Agent (GS-13):** $100,000-$115,000 + LEAP = $125,000-$144,000
- **Supervisory Special Agent (GS-14/15):** $120,000-$165,000 + LEAP = $150,000-$206,000

**What translates directly:**
- Source operations and confidential informant handling
- Interviewing and interrogation
- Counterintelligence investigations
- Operational planning and execution
- Report writing and case documentation
- Interagency coordination

**Reality check:**
FBI highly values 35M experience—your source handling, interviewing skills, and operational background translate directly to FBI Special Agent work, particularly in counterintelligence and intelligence operations.

FBI age limit: Must enter on duty before age 37 (some veteran exceptions possible but limited). If you're 32+ and interested in FBI, apply IMMEDIATELY—you're running out of time.

Hiring process: 12-18 months from application to academy. Testing, interviews, polygraph, background investigation, medical clearance, and fitness test. Your military service and clearance give you significant advantages.

FBI New Agent Training: 21 weeks at Quantico. Covers firearms, defensive tactics, investigative techniques, law, and operational training.

FBI deploys you where they need you—you don't get to pick your first office (usually mid-sized city, not NYC/DC). After 3-5 years you can transfer. Expect 50+ hour weeks, on-call status, and operational tempo similar to military.

**Best for:** 35M collectors interested in federal law enforcement, want to continue source operations domestically, and prefer US-based career with federal stability and pension.

### Defense HUMINT Contractor (highest near-term pay, familiar mission)

**Civilian job titles:**
- HUMINT Collector
- HUMINT Operations Officer
- Tactical HUMINT Collector
- HUMINT Analyst
- Source Handler
- Debriefer
- Screener

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level CONUS:** $90,000-$115,000
- **Mid-level CONUS:** $115,000-$145,000
- **Senior CONUS:** $145,000-$175,000
- **OCONUS (Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, etc.):** $130,000-$200,000
- **High-threat OCONUS:** $180,000-$280,000+
- **Short-term surge contracts:** $200,000-$350,000 (6-12 month rotations)

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing the exact same HUMINT work as a contractor that you did as a 35M, often supporting the same military units and agencies you supported on active duty.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Active TS/SCI clearance** (absolutely non-negotiable)
- **Recent HUMINT operational experience** (you have this)
- **Bachelor's degree** (preferred, sometimes waived for experience)
- **Language skills** (critical for many contracts—Arabic, Pashto, Dari, etc.)
- **Security+ or baseline IT cert** (required for some DoD contracts)

**Companies actively hiring 35M HUMINT collectors:**
- **CACI International** (major HUMINT contractor)
- **Leidos**
- **Booz Allen Hamilton**
- **PAE (Pacific Architects and Engineers)**
- **SAIC**
- **SOC (Special Operations Consulting)**
- **General Dynamics IT**
- **ManTech**
- **Parsons**
- **Amentum**
- **Peraton**
- **BAE Systems**
- **L3Harris**
- **DynCorp International**

**Reality check:**
HUMINT contracting is lucrative but unstable and often requires extended OCONUS deployments. Contracts are 6-12 months initially with options to extend. You work 12+ hour days, 6-7 days per week, often in combat zones or high-threat environments.

Post-Afghanistan/Iraq drawdown, HUMINT contracts decreased but still exist—Middle East (Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria support), Africa (counter-terrorism), and CONUS support to agencies and training. Competition increased but demand remains for experienced collectors.

The money is real. Many 35Ms contract for 3-7 years, bank $500K-$1M+, then transition to CIA, FBI, or other careers. It's not a 20-year career path but an excellent way to maximize earnings while maintaining operational skills and clearance.

Tax advantage: Foreign earned income exclusion is $126,500/year (2024), meaning first $126K earned overseas is federal tax-free if you meet IRS requirements.

**Best for:** 35M collectors who want maximum short-term earnings, are willing to work high-threat environments overseas, want to stay operational, and can handle contract-to-contract employment.

### Defense Human Intelligence Service (DHS) & DIA HUMINT (government HUMINT mission)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Human Intelligence Officer (DIA)
- Defense HUMINT Collector
- Defense Attache Support
- HUMINT Operations Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level (GS-11 to GS-12):** $80,000-$105,000 + locality/overseas allowances
- **Mid-career (GS-13 to GS-14):** $105,000-$140,000 + allowances
- **Senior (GS-14 to GS-15):** $120,000-$165,000 + allowances
- **Overseas assignments add:** $20K-$50K in allowances and differentials

**What translates directly:**
Everything. DIA manages Defense HUMINT Service (DHS), the DoD's human intelligence collection enterprise. Your 35M experience is exactly what they need.

**Reality check:**
DIA HUMINT positions involve HUMINT collection operations, often overseas at embassies and defense attaché offices, supporting tactical and strategic intelligence requirements. Missions include liaison with foreign militaries, source operations, and intelligence collection on defense and military matters.

Work involves significant overseas assignments (often 2-3 year tours). Family can usually accompany you (unlike CIA where some assignments are unaccompanied). Lifestyle is similar to military overseas but as a civilian.

Hiring process: 12-18 months including background investigation, polygraph, and clearance adjudication. DIA actively recruits military HUMINT professionals.

**Best for:** 35M collectors who want to continue defense HUMINT mission, prefer government stability, and are willing to work overseas with better work-life balance than CIA operations.

### Corporate Intelligence & Competitive Intelligence (business applications of HUMINT)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Competitive Intelligence Analyst
- Strategic Intelligence Analyst
- Business Intelligence Analyst (not IT—strategic business intelligence)
- Market Intelligence Manager
- Corporate HUMINT Analyst (rare, high-end corporate roles)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level:** $80,000-$105,000
- **Mid-level:** $105,000-$145,000
- **Senior/Manager:** $145,000-$190,000
- **Director level:** $190,000-$270,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Source recruitment and management (becomes business source networks, industry experts)
- Elicitation techniques (ethical competitive intelligence gathering)
- Information analysis and reporting
- Assessing credibility and bias
- Briefing executives on strategic intelligence

**Industries hiring:**
- **Tech companies** (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon—tracking competitors, emerging technologies)
- **Pharmaceutical** (Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson—competitive drug development intelligence)
- **Defense contractors** (Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop—tracking foreign developments)
- **Consulting firms** (McKinsey, BCG, Bain—strategic intelligence for clients)
- **Financial services** (JPMorgan, Goldman—market intelligence, geopolitical risk)

**Reality check:**
This is HUMINT applied to business—collecting intelligence on competitors, market trends, emerging technologies, and strategic threats to the business. Instead of recruiting sources on enemy forces, you're cultivating industry experts, former employees of competitors, and market insiders (all done ethically and legally).

The mission is different—protecting corporate interests rather than national security. Pay can be excellent, especially at senior levels. Work-life balance is typically better than government/contracting. No clearance required for most positions, meaning geographic flexibility.

Some corporate roles require clearances (defense contractors protecting classified programs), combining cleared HUMINT work with corporate environment.

**Best for:** 35M collectors interested in business applications of HUMINT, want private sector pay and work-life balance, and are comfortable with corporate rather than national security missions.

### Law Enforcement Intelligence & Investigations

**Civilian job titles:**
- DEA Special Agent
- ATF Special Agent
- HSI Special Agent (Homeland Security Investigations)
- US Marshals Deputy Marshal
- State/Local Detective (Major Crimes, Intelligence Units)

**Salary ranges:**
- **DEA Special Agent:** $70,000-$105,000 + 25% LEAP = $87,500-$131,000
- **ATF/HSI Special Agent:** Similar to DEA
- **US Marshals:** $55,000-$95,000 + LEAP
- **State/Local Detective:** $65,000-$110,000 (varies widely by location)

**What translates directly:**
- Confidential informant recruitment and handling
- Interrogation and interviewing
- Source debriefing
- Undercover operations (with training)
- Case management and documentation

**Best for:** 35M collectors interested in law enforcement, want to apply HUMINT skills to criminal investigations, and prefer domestic work.

## Required Certifications & Training

### High Priority (Get These)

**Bachelor's Degree (any field—International Relations, Intelligence, Political Science, or Language Studies preferred)**

Required for CIA, FBI, DIA, and most federal positions. Sometimes waived for extensive operational experience but limits advancement.
