# Virginia Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Exemptions

## Bottom Line Up Front

Virginia offers some of the nation's most generous veteran tax benefits in 2025. Veterans rated 100% disabled by the VA pay ZERO property taxes on their primary residence and one vehicle. ALL military retirees can subtract $40,000 from Virginia taxable income starting in 2025 (up from $30,000 in 2024), regardless of age. These benefits can save you $3,000-$8,000+ annually depending on your locality. A 100% disabled veteran in Fairfax County with a $500,000 home saves approximately $5,000/year in property taxes alone—that's $100,000+ over 20 years.

## Military Retirement Income Tax Subtraction: $40,000 in 2025

### The Numbers That Matter

For tax year 2025, Virginia resident veterans can subtract **$40,000** of military retirement income from their Virginia taxable income. This increased from $30,000 in 2024. This is a permanent subtraction that applies year after year.

**2024 Tax Year:** $30,000 subtraction
**2025 Tax Year and Beyond:** $40,000 subtraction

### Who Qualifies?

- **ALL military retirees**, regardless of age (age requirement was removed beginning with the 2024 tax year)
- Includes retired members of the U.S. Armed Forces, U.S. Armed Forces Reserves, and National Guard
- Must be a Virginia resident
- Only applies to military retirement pay included in your federal adjusted gross income

### What Counts as Military Retirement Income?

**ELIGIBLE:**
- Military retired pay
- Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP)
- Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments to surviving spouses
- Military pension annuities

**NOT ELIGIBLE:**
- Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) distributions
- VA disability compensation (already tax-free federally)
- Civilian federal retirement (FERS/CSRS)
- Social Security benefits

### Calculate Your Tax Savings

Virginia's top income tax rate is 5.75%. Here's what the $40,000 subtraction saves you:

**Annual Tax Savings:** $40,000 × 5.75% = **$2,300/year**

**10-Year Savings:** $23,000
**20-Year Savings:** $46,000
**30-Year Savings:** $69,000

If you're married filing jointly with two military retirees, each spouse can claim the subtraction:

**Combined Annual Savings:** $80,000 × 5.75% = **$4,600/year**
**20-Year Combined Savings:** $92,000

### How to Claim the Subtraction

File Virginia Form 760 (resident return) and claim the military benefits subtraction on Schedule ADJ. You'll need:

1. Your federal adjusted gross income from Form 1040
2. Documentation of military retirement income (1099-R)
3. DD Form 214 or equivalent proving honorable discharge

**Important:** This is a subtraction, not a deduction. It reduces your Virginia taxable income before calculating your tax liability.

## 100% Disabled Veteran Real Property Tax Exemption

### The Complete Tax Exemption

Virginia exempts from taxation the **entire value** of real property owned and occupied as the principal residence by a veteran rated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as having a 100% service-connected, permanent and total disability.

3. **Residency:** The property must be your principal place of residence
4. **Ownership:** You must own the property (sole ownership or joint with spouse)

### What's Covered?

- Your primary residence (house, condo, townhome, mobile home)

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Not Applying Because You Think You Don't Qualify

**Reality:** Many veterans with TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) don't realize they qualify. If the VA pays you at the 100% rate, you're eligible—even if your combined rating is less than 100%.

**Solution:** Check your VA Benefit Summary Letter. If it shows you're receiving compensation at the 100% rate, apply.

### Mistake #2: Claiming TSP Distributions as Military Retirement

**Reality:** TSP distributions are NOT eligible for the military retirement income subtraction.

**Solution:** Only claim actual military retirement pay (shown on your 1099-R from DFAS with distribution code 7). TSP distributions use a different 1099-R from your TSP provider.

### Mistake #3: Not Applying for Vehicle Exemption Because You Lease

**Reality:** Leased vehicles don't qualify, but many veterans continue paying property taxes on owned vehicles thinking they don't qualify.

**Solution:** If you own your vehicle (have the title), you qualify. Apply even if you're financing it.

### Mistake #4: Waiting Until Age 55 to Claim Income Subtraction

**Reality:** The age requirement was eliminated starting with the 2024 tax year.

**Solution:** If you're receiving military retirement pay, claim the subtraction regardless of your age. If you filed 2024 taxes before April 2025, consider amending if you didn't claim the full $30,000 subtraction.

### Mistake #5: Not Applying Because Your Rating is Pending Appeal

**Reality:** If you're currently receiving benefits at the 100% rate (even if you're appealing for a higher rating or different effective date), you qualify now.

**Solution:** Apply with your current VA Benefit Summary Letter showing 100% payment rate.

### Mistake #6: Thinking Surviving Spouse Benefits End If You Move

**Reality:** As of 2019, surviving spouses can relocate to a different Virginia locality and maintain their exemption.

**Solution:** When moving, apply with your new locality within 30 days. Include documentation showing you had the exemption in your previous locality.

### Mistake #7: Not Claiming the Vehicle Purchase SUT Exemption

**Reality:** Many 100% disabled veterans pay the 4.15% sales tax because they don't know about the exemption.

**Solution:** Bring your VA documentation to the DMV when titling ANY vehicle purchase. The exemption can be used multiple times (once per vehicle you own).

### Mistake #8: Assuming Your Spouse Doesn't Qualify After You Pass Away

**Reality:** Surviving spouses maintain ALL veteran tax benefits if they don't remarry and maintain the property as their primary residence.

**Solution:** Ensure your spouse knows about these benefits and has copies of all necessary documentation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Income Tax Questions

**Q: I retired from the military and also receive VA disability compensation. Can I subtract both?**

A: VA disability compensation is already tax-free federally and at the state level—you don't report it as income at all. You can subtract up to $40,000 of your military retirement pay (the taxable portion that DFAS pays you) from Virginia taxable income in 2025.

**Q: I receive a military pension and also work a civilian job. Can I still claim the $40,000 subtraction?**

A: Yes. The subtraction applies to your military retirement income regardless of other income sources.

**Q: My military retirement pay is only $25,000 per year. Can I claim the full $40,000 subtraction?**

A: No. You can only subtract the amount of military retirement income you actually received. If you received $25,000 in military retired pay, you can subtract $25,000.

**Q: I'm a surviving spouse receiving SBP. Can I claim the subtraction?**

A: Yes. Surviving spouses receiving Survivor Benefit Plan payments can subtract up to $40,000 of SBP income starting in 2025.

**Q: Does the subtraction phase out at higher income levels?**

A: No. There is no income limit or phase-out. All military retirees can claim the subtraction regardless of total income.

**Q: I moved to Virginia in July 2024. Can I claim the full subtraction?**

A: You can only subtract military retirement income earned while you were a Virginia resident. If you moved mid-year, prorate your military retirement income based on residency duration.

### Property Tax Exemption Questions

**Q: I'm rated 90% by the VA. Do I qualify for the property tax exemption?**

A: You qualify if you're receiving compensation at the 100% rate due to unemployability (TDIU), even if your combined rating is 90%. Check your VA Benefit Summary Letter—if it shows payment at the 100% rate, you qualify.

**Q: I own a home and a rental property. Can I exempt both?**

A: No. The exemption only applies to your principal residence—the property you occupy as your primary home.

**Q: My wife and I jointly own our home. Does the exemption apply to the full value?**

A: Yes. The exemption applies to the entire property value regardless of ownership structure (sole, joint with spouse, or tenancy by the entirety).

**Q: We own a home on 5 acres. Is all the land exempt?**

A: No. The exemption covers your home and up to one acre of land. The remaining 4 acres would be subject to property tax.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled and my wife is a 50% disabled veteran. Can we stack exemptions?**

A: No. Only one exemption applies per property. However, the 100% exemption covers the full property value.

**Q: I got my 100% rating in August. Do I pay property taxes for the whole year?**

A: Most localities prorate the exemption based on when your rating became effective. If you got your rating in August, you'd typically owe property taxes for January-July and be exempt August-December.

**Q: Can I apply for the exemption before I buy a home?**

A: Yes! Some localities (like Fairfax County) offer pre-certification. This helps when applying for a mortgage, as lenders can factor in the tax savings.

**Q: I'm buying a $800,000 home. Is there any cap on the exemption?**

A: No. Virginia has no dollar cap on the exemption. Whether your home is worth $200,000 or $2,000,000, the full value is exempt if you qualify.

### Vehicle Tax Exemption Questions

**Q: I own three vehicles. Can I exempt all of them?**

A: No. The exemption applies to one vehicle only. You designate which vehicle receives the exemption.

**Q: Can I change which vehicle is exempt each year?**

A: Yes. Contact your local Commissioner of Revenue before the tax year to designate a different vehicle.

**Q: My truck is registered to my business. Can I exempt it?**

A: The vehicle must be used primarily by or for you personally. Business vehicles typically don't qualify, but check with your Commissioner of Revenue about mixed-use vehicles.

**Q: I bought a new car and used the sales tax exemption. Can I also exempt it from annual property tax?**

A: Yes! These are separate benefits. You can use the sales tax exemption when you purchase the vehicle AND designate it for the annual property tax exemption.

**Q: Does my spouse's vehicle qualify if it's titled only in their name?**

A: Yes, as long as the vehicle is used primarily by or for you.

**Q: I lease my car. Can I exempt it from property tax?**

A: No. The exemption only applies to vehicles you own (not lease).

**Q: I have a motorcycle and a car. Can I exempt the motorcycle?**

A: No. The exemption specifically excludes motorcycles. Only passenger cars and pickup trucks (under 10,000 lbs) qualify.

### Sales Tax Exemption Questions

**Q: I used the sales tax exemption when I bought my truck in 2022. Can I use it again?**

A: Yes! If you sell or trade in that truck and buy another vehicle, you can use the exemption again.

**Q: Do I have to buy from a dealer to get the sales tax exemption?**

A: No. The exemption applies whether you buy from a dealer or private party. You claim it at the DMV when you title the vehicle.

**Q: I bought a car last month and paid the sales tax. Can I get a refund?**

A: Possibly. Contact the DMV immediately. If the vehicle hasn't been titled yet or was very recently titled, they may be able to process a refund. After titling is complete, refunds become very difficult.

**Q: Does the exemption apply to vehicle registration fees?**

A: No. The sales tax exemption only applies to the 4.15% Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. Registration fees are separate.

### Administrative Questions

**Q: How long does it take to get approved for the property tax exemption?**

A: Processing times vary by locality:
- Fairfax County: 30 days typically
- Virginia Beach: 2-4 weeks
- Norfolk: 10-15 business days
- Arlington: 3-4 weeks
- Richmond: 4-6 weeks

**Q: Do I need to reapply every year?**

A: For property tax exemptions, most localities do NOT require annual reapplication. For vehicle tax exemptions, some localities send annual confirmation forms. Income tax subtraction must be claimed annually on your tax return.

**Q: What if my disability rating is reduced?**

A: If the VA reduces your rating below 100% payment status, you must notify your Commissioner of Revenue immediately. The exemption ends, and you'll owe property taxes from the effective date of the reduction.

**Q: I'm a surviving spouse who remarried. Do I lose the exemption?**

A: Yes. If you remarry, you lose eligibility for the surviving spouse exemption from the date of remarriage.

**Q: My VA rating says "permanent and total" but doesn't specifically say "100%." Do I qualify?**

A: Check your VA Benefit Summary Letter for the compensation rate. If it shows you're being paid at the 100% rate (even with a combined rating less than 100%), you qualify.

**Q: Can I get help applying for these benefits?**

A: Yes. Contact:
- Your local Commissioner of Revenue (most offer free application assistance)
- Virginia Department of Veterans Services: (804) 786-0286
- County/city veteran services offices
- Veterans Service Organizations (VFW, American Legion, DAV)
- VA accredited attorneys or agents

## Conclusion: Virginia Values Veterans

Virginia's veteran tax benefits package is among the nation's most comprehensive. With the 2025 increase to a $40,000 military retirement income subtraction, elimination of age requirements, full property tax exemptions for 100% disabled veterans, and vehicle tax relief, the Commonwealth demonstrates genuine commitment to those who served.

A 100% disabled veteran in Northern Virginia can save $10,000+ annually in combined benefits—over $200,000 in lifetime savings. Even military retirees without VA disability ratings save $2,300 per year in state income taxes starting in 2025.

These aren't hypothetical benefits—they're real dollars back in your pocket, applicable right now. Take action today to claim what you've earned through your service.

**Start with one call to your local Commissioner of Revenue. That single call could save you thousands of dollars this year and hundreds of thousands over your lifetime in Virginia.**
