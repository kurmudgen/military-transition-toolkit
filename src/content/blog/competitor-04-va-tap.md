## 8. MTT's OPPORTUNITY

### Features to Add:
1. **Digital TAP reinforcement** - Interactive course covering same content
2. **Benefits application wizard** - Step-by-step filing for disability, education, home loans
3. **Post-TAP support** - Ongoing guidance after mandatory course
4. **Personalized benefits roadmap** - Based on service history, injuries, goals
5. **VA claims tracker** - Monitor application status
6. **Benefits calculator** - Estimate disability rating, GI Bill value, loan eligibility
7. **Community Q&A** - Ask questions to veterans who've been through it

### Differentiation:
- **"TAP gave you the overview; MTT helps you take action"**
- **"Interactive TAP, available anytime"** - vs one-time classroom
- **"Your personalized benefits guide"** - vs generic lecture
- **"The support that continues after TAP ends"**

### Underserved Segments:
- Post-separation veterans who need TAP refresher
- Service members who attended TAP but forgot details
- Complex cases (multiple disabilities, deployments, unique situations)
- Veterans navigating claims process 1-5 years after separation
- Family members and survivors seeking benefits

### Key Insight:
TAP is **mandatory education** but provides **no action tools**. MTT should be **"TAP's implementation layer"** - turn their overview into actionable steps. Every TAP graduate is a potential MTT user who needs help **applying what they learned**.

Position MTT as **"TAP +++"** - everything TAP teaches, now interactive and ongoing.
