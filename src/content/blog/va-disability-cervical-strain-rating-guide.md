# VA Disability Rating for Cervical Strain (Neck): Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Cervical strain (neck conditions) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 5237** with ratings from **10% to 100%** using the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine. Most veterans receive **10-20%** for limitation of motion. Cervical conditions often involve **upper extremity radiculopathy** (nerve symptoms in arms) which is rated **separately**, potentially increasing your total rating significantly. Neck problems are common from carrying heavy equipment, wearing Kevlar helmets, and vehicle accidents. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Cervical Strain and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Cervical strain refers to injury or damage to the muscles, ligaments, and other soft tissues of the neck (cervical spine).

**Related cervical conditions:**
- Cervical strain/sprain
- Degenerative disc disease
- Cervical spondylosis (arthritis)
- Herniated discs
- Cervical stenosis

**Military causes:**
- **Helmet/NVG wear**: Heavy helmets and night vision cause strain
- **Heavy loads**: Rucksacks putting stress on neck
- **Vehicle accidents**: Whiplash injuries
- **Airborne/parachute operations**: Landing impacts
- **Combat**: Blast exposure, carrying heavy weapons
- **Desk work**: Military desk jobs with poor ergonomics
- **Repetitive movements**: Looking up/down, turning head

## VA Rating Criteria

Cervical spine is rated under **38 CFR § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine**.

### Rating Based on Range of Motion

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Forward flexion greater than 30° but not greater than 40°; OR combined ROM greater than 170° but not greater than 335°; OR muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour |
| **20%** | Forward flexion greater than 15° but not greater than 30°; OR combined ROM not greater than 170°; OR muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour |
| **30%** | Forward flexion 15° or less; OR favorable ankylosis of entire cervical spine |
| **40%** | Unfavorable ankylosis of entire cervical spine |
| **100%** | Unfavorable ankylosis of entire spine |

**Normal cervical ROM:**
- Forward flexion: 0-45°
- Extension: 0-45°
- Left/right lateral flexion: 0-45° each
- Left/right rotation: 0-80° each
- **Combined ROM: 340°**

### IVDS Rating (Incapacitating Episodes)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Episodes at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks in past 12 months |
| **20%** | Episodes at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks |
| **40%** | Episodes at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks |
| **60%** | Episodes at least 6 weeks in past 12 months |

### Critical: Upper Extremity Radiculopathy

**Cervical nerve issues in arms rated separately:**
- Neck rating + separate rating for each affected arm
- Radiculopathy ratings: 10% (mild) to 70% (complete paralysis)
- Dominant arm receives higher rating

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing neck complaints
- Vehicle accident reports
- MOS involving helmet wear, heavy loads
- Physical profiles for neck

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Orthopedic/neurological evaluation
- MRI showing disc bulges, herniations
- X-ray showing arthritis, stenosis
- EMG/nerve studies if radiculopathy

### Severity Evidence
- Range of motion measurements
- Documentation of radiculopathy symptoms
- Treatment records
- Functional limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will measure:**
- Forward flexion (chin to chest)
- Extension (looking up)
- Lateral flexion (ear to shoulder, each side)
- Rotation (looking side to side)

**They'll also check for:**
- Muscle spasm and guarding
- Radiculopathy symptoms
- Neurological deficits in arms

**What to tell them:**
- Where pain begins during movement
- Any arm symptoms (pain, numbness, tingling, weakness)
- Flare-up frequency and severity
- Functional limitations

## Secondary Conditions

**Claim separately:**
- **Upper extremity radiculopathy** (each arm)
- **Headaches/migraines** - cervical issues cause headaches
- **Shoulder conditions** - related structures

**Neck can be secondary to:**
- Lower back conditions (compensating)
- Shoulder injuries (related area)
- TBI (related mechanism)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim neck and lower back separately?
Yes. Cervical (neck) and thoracolumbar (mid/lower back) spine are rated separately.

### What if I have arm symptoms from my neck?
Claim radiculopathy separately. Each arm with nerve symptoms from cervical spine gets its own rating.

### Does degenerative disc disease rate differently?
No. DDD, cervical strain, and other cervical conditions use the same rating formula based on range of motion or incapacitating episodes.
