[INTRO]

**Cold Open:**

Sergeant First Class Lisa Martinez spent 10 years in Army Signal Corps managing tactical communications networks. She separated in 2022, completed a 16-week coding bootcamp using her GI Bill, and landed a $120,000 full-stack developer job at a fintech startup—all within 7 months of leaving the military.

This is Jacob. Today we're covering Lisa's rapid transition from military IT to software development through coding bootcamp.

**Military Background:**
25U Signal Support Systems Specialist, managed tactical networks for battalion-level operations, troubleshot complex communication systems, held Secret clearance, deployed twice to Afghanistan.

**Transition Decision:**
Lisa knew she wanted to stay in tech but move into software development for better pay and remote work options. Researched bootcamps extensively, chose Hack Reactor (now Galvanize) in Austin for strong veteran outcomes.

**Bootcamp Experience:**
- 16 weeks, 80+ hours/week
- Learned JavaScript, React, Node.js, databases, full-stack development
- Built 5 portfolio projects including final capstone
- Used Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance ($2,400/month in Austin) to live while studying
- Total cost: $17,500 tuition (covered by GI Bill)

**Job Search:**
Started applying 2 weeks before bootcamp graduation. Process:
- 100+ applications over 6 weeks
- 15 phone screens
- 8 technical interviews
- 3 final-round interviews
- 2 offers

Accepted offer from fintech startup: $120,000 salary, equity, full remote work.

**Current Role:**
Full-stack developer working on payment processing systems. Typical day: standups, coding, code reviews, deploying features. Work-life balance excellent (40 hours/week, fully remote).

**Keys to Success:**
1. Military IT experience gave technical foundation for bootcamp
2. Security clearance opened doors to defense tech companies
3. Strong work ethic from military helped survive intense bootcamp pace
4. Built impressive portfolio demonstrating skills to employers

**Challenges:**
Imposter syndrome (competing with CS degree holders), steep learning curve in bootcamp, job search rejection (common for bootcamp grads), adapting to startup culture.

**Advice for Signal/IT Veterans:**
Target bootcamps with strong veteran outcomes and ISAs (Income Share Agreements). Build real projects. Network with veteran developers. Consider defense tech companies (higher pay, value clearances). Don't undersell military IT experience.
