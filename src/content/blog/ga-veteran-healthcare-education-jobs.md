## Education Benefits for Georgia Veterans

### Georgia HERO Scholarship Program

Georgia's **HERO (Helping Educate Reservists and their Offspring) Scholarship** is the state's premier education benefit - but it's specifically for **National Guard and Reserve members and their families**, NOT all veterans.

**Eligibility**:
- Children and spouses of Georgia National Guard or U.S. Military Reserve members who:
  - Were deployed to a combat zone on or after February 1, 2003, AND
  - Were killed, died, or became **100% permanently disabled** as a result of injuries received in that combat zone

**Children must**:
- Have been born before or within 9 months of the qualifying term of service
- Be 25 years or younger during the qualifying term of service

**Benefit amount**:
- Covers tuition and fees at Georgia public universities and colleges
- Renewable each academic year
- Must apply within 2 years of gaining eligibility

**Qualifying schools**: All Georgia public institutions:
- University of Georgia
- Georgia Tech
- Georgia State University
- University of West Georgia
- Kennesaw State University

- Valdosta State University
- All University System of Georgia schools
- All Georgia technical colleges

**Application**: [gafutures.org/hero](https://www.gafutures.org/hope-state-aid-programs/scholarships-grants/hero/)

**Important limitation**: This does NOT cover all 100% disabled veterans' dependents - only Guard/Reserve members disabled in combat zones. Active duty veterans' families should use federal GI Bill benefits.

### Post-9/11 GI Bill - Yellow Ribbon Schools

Several Georgia schools participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, covering 100% of out-of-state tuition for qualifying veterans:

#### Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)

**Yellow Ribbon**: Unlimited slots for undergraduate and graduate students

**Note**: As a private school, Emory's tuition is significantly higher, but Yellow Ribbon participation helps close the gap

### In-State Tuition for Veterans

Veterans using GI Bill benefits qualify for in-state tuition at Georgia public schools under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA), regardless of residency status.

**Eligibility**:
- Using Post-9/11 GI Bill or Montgomery GI Bill

This removes a major barrier for veterans relocating to Georgia for school.

## Employment Resources for Georgia Veterans

### State Hiring Preference

Georgia law gives hiring preference to qualified veterans for state government jobs.

**How it works**:
- **War veterans**: 5-point credit added to exam scores
- **Veterans with 10%+ disability rating**: 10-point credit
- **Spouses of disabled veterans** (whose disability disqualifies them from employment): 10-point credit
- **Unremarried surviving spouses** of veterans who died during wartime: 10-point credit

**When agencies don't use numerically scored exams**: Preference is given to equally qualified veterans over non-veterans

**Layoff protection**: During reductions in force, veterans with preference must be retained over those without preference
