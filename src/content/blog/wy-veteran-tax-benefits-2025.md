# Wyoming Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Exemptions

## Bottom Line Up Front

Wyoming offers veterans one of the most tax-friendly environments in America: **NO state income tax** on any income including military retirement pay and TSP distributions, **$6,000 property tax exemption** (up from $3,000 in 2024) on primary residences or vehicle registration fees, and special exemptions for disabled veterans. A veteran with a $350,000 home can save approximately **$350 annually** in property taxes, and over 20 years, Wyoming's zero income tax saves an O-5 retiree approximately **$180,000** compared to states with income tax. However, Wyoming has higher-than-average property taxes (0.58% average) to compensate for no sales tax on most goods.

**Key 2025 Benefits:**
- Zero state income tax (saves $9,000+ annually for most military retirees)
- $6,000 assessed value property tax exemption (increased from $3,000 in 2024)
- 50%+ disabled veterans: Free vehicle registration for one vehicle
- 100% disabled veterans: Lifetime free hunting/fishing licenses
- POW veterans: Free vehicle registration exemption

## Wyoming's No State Income Tax: The Big Win for Veterans

### What It Means in Real Dollars

Wyoming is one of only **nine states** with no state income tax. For veterans, this means:

**Military Retirement Pay:** 100% tax-free at the state level
**VA Disability Compensation:** Already federally tax-free (all states)
**TSP/401(k) Withdrawals:** No state tax on retirement account distributions
**Social Security Benefits:** No state tax on Social Security income
**Investment Income:** No state tax on dividends, capital gains, or interest

### 20-Year Savings Projections

Let's compare what an O-5 retiree with $65,000 annual military retirement pay saves in Wyoming versus neighboring states:

**O-5 Retiree ($65,000/year retirement pay):**
- **Wyoming:** $0 state income tax annually = **$0 over 20 years**
- **Montana:** ~$2,600 annually (after 50% exemption) = **$52,000 over 20 years**
- **Colorado:** ~$3,900 annually (after $24,000 exemption for 65+) = **$78,000 over 20 years**
- **Idaho:** $0 after age 65, but ~$3,250 annually before 65 = **~$32,500 over 10 years**

**E-7 Retiree ($40,000/year retirement pay):**
- **Wyoming:** $0 annually = **$0 over 20 years**
- **Montana:** ~$1,600 annually (after exemption) = **$32,000 over 20 years**
- **Colorado:** ~$960 annually (after exemption) = **$19,200 over 20 years**
- **Idaho:** $0 after age 65, but ~$1,800 annually before 65 = **~$18,000 over 10 years**

**The Verdict:** Over a 20-year retirement, Wyoming veterans save **$50,000 to $80,000** in state income taxes compared to neighboring states. That's a new truck, help with grandkids' college, or a significantly more comfortable retirement.

## Wyoming Property Tax Exemption for Veterans

### 2025 Exemption Increase: $3,000 to $6,000

Wyoming Legislature passed **SF0089** in 2024, doubling the veteran property tax exemption from $3,000 to **$6,000** in assessed value starting in tax year 2025. This translates to approximately **$350 in annual tax savings** (increased from $175 in 2024).

### Eligibility Requirements

**Three-Year Residency Requirement:**
You must be a Wyoming resident for **three consecutive years** before claiming the exemption.

**Service Requirements (Choose One):**
1. **WWII, Korean War, or Vietnam War veterans** with honorable discharge
2. **Overseas combat veterans** who received an **Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal** or equivalent
3. **Disabled veterans** with a compensable service-connected disability rating from the VA (any era)

**Important:** Disabled veterans do NOT need to meet the war period or medal requirements—your VA disability rating qualifies you regardless of when or where you served.

### How to Apply

**Application Deadline:** Fourth Monday of May, every year
**Where to Apply:** Your local County Assessor's Office
**Required Documents:**
- DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge)
- VA disability rating letter (if applicable)
- Proof of Wyoming residency for 3+ years

**Application Process:**
1. Visit your County Assessor's Office between January 1 and the fourth Monday of May
2. Complete the Veterans Property Tax Exemption Application
3. Submit DD-214 and disability documentation
4. Receive confirmation of exemption

**Surviving Spouses:** Unremarried surviving spouses of qualifying veterans may continue receiving this exemption if they remain Wyoming residents and do not remarry.

### County-by-County Property Tax Rates

Wyoming property taxes vary significantly by county. Here's how the $6,000 exemption saves you money in major counties:

#### **Laramie County (Cheyenne)**
- **Average Effective Rate:** 0.66%
- **Median Property Tax:** $1,115/year (for $169,900 home)
- **Exemption Savings:** ~$330/year
- **Home Value for Average Veteran:** $350,000 typical
- **Annual Property Tax (Before Exemption):** ~$2,310
- **Annual Property Tax (After Exemption):** ~$1,980
- **20-Year Savings:** ~$6,600

#### **Natrona County (Casper)**
- **Average Effective Rate:** 0.55%
- **Median Property Tax:** $949/year (for $173,300 home)
- **Exemption Savings:** ~$330/year

- **20-Year Savings:** ~$6,600

#### **Campbell County (Gillette)**

- **Annual Property Tax (After Exemption):** ~$1,537
- **Exemption Savings:** ~$348/year
- **20-Year Savings:** ~$6,960

### Applying the Exemption to Vehicle Registration Instead

If you don't use the $6,000 exemption on real property, you can apply it to your **vehicle licensing fee** instead. This is especially valuable for:

- Veterans who rent rather than own
- Veterans with lower property values
- Veterans who own RVs or expensive vehicles

**How Vehicle Registration Exemption Works:**
Wyoming charges annual vehicle registration fees based on the vehicle's value and age. The $6,000 assessed value exemption applied to a vehicle's licensing fee can save veterans **$80-$150 annually** depending on the vehicle.

**Example Calculation:**
- 2022 Ford F-150 (MSRP $45,000, current value ~$38,000)
- Annual registration fee: ~$420
- With $6,000 exemption applied: ~$350
- **Annual Savings:** ~$70
- **Over 10 years:** ~$700

**You must choose:** Property tax exemption OR vehicle registration exemption—you cannot claim both.

## Wyoming vs. Neighboring States: Tax Comparison

### Income Tax on Military Retirement Pay

| State | State Income Tax on Military Retirement |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| **Wyoming** | **$0 (no state income tax)** |
| Montana | Partially taxed (50% exemption for first 5 years; $5,060+ exemptions based on income) |
| Colorado | Partially taxed ($15,000-$24,000 exemption based on age) |
| Idaho | $0 for retirees 65+ or disabled 62+ |
| South Dakota | $0 (no state income tax) |

**Winner:** Wyoming (tie with South Dakota)

### Property Tax Benefits

| State | Property Tax Exemption for Veterans |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| **Wyoming** | **$6,000 assessed value exemption (~$350/year)** |
| Montana | 50%-100% reduction for 100% disabled veterans (income-based) |
| Colorado | No specific veteran property tax exemption |
| Idaho | Up to $1,500 reduction on property taxes |

**Winner:** Montana for 100% disabled veterans; Wyoming for all other veterans

### Overall Tax Burden for Veterans

**Annual Tax Savings Example (O-5 Retiree, $350,000 Home, $65,000 Retirement Pay):**

**Wyoming:**
- State Income Tax: $0
- Property Tax: ~$1,680 (after $350 exemption)
- **Total Annual Taxes:** ~$1,680

**Montana:**
- State Income Tax: ~$2,600 (after partial exemption)
- Property Tax: ~$1,800 (if not 100% disabled)
- **Total Annual Taxes:** ~$4,400

**Colorado:**
- State Income Tax: ~$3,900 (after exemption)
- Property Tax: ~$2,030 (no veteran exemption)
- **Total Annual Taxes:** ~$5,930

- **Total Annual Taxes:** ~$1,225 (65+) or ~$4,475 (under 65)

**Verdict:** Wyoming offers the **lowest lifetime tax burden** for veterans when accounting for all working and retirement years. Idaho edges ahead slightly for veterans 65+ if they qualify, but Wyoming wins for all veterans under 65 and those who work part-time in retirement.

## Wyoming Property Tax Reality Check

### The Trade-Off: No Income Tax = Higher Property Taxes

Wyoming funds state and local services primarily through property taxes, mineral royalties, and federal mineral lease revenues—not income tax. This means:

**Property Tax Rates:** Wyoming's average effective property tax rate is **0.58%**, which is:
- Higher than Colorado (0.50%)
- Higher than Idaho (0.63%) - actually lower than Idaho
- Lower than Montana (0.71%)

**What This Means:**
If you're coming from a high-income-tax state like California (up to 13.3% income tax) or New York (up to 10.9%), Wyoming's property taxes will feel like a bargain. But if you're coming from Texas or Florida (also no income tax), Wyoming's property taxes are comparable.

### Calculating Your Personal Tax Savings

**Step 1: Calculate Your Current State Income Tax**
Look at your last state tax return. How much did you pay in state income tax?

**Step 2: Calculate Your Wyoming Property Tax**
Use this formula:
- (Home Value × 0.58%) - $350 = Annual Property Tax

**Example:**
- $350,000 home × 0.58% = $2,030
- $2,030 - $350 veteran exemption = **$1,680 annual property tax**

**Step 3: Compare**
- Current state income tax: $X
- Wyoming property tax: $1,680
- **Net Savings:** $X - $1,680

For most military retirees earning $40,000-$80,000/year in retirement pay, moving to Wyoming results in **$5,000-$10,000 annual tax savings** compared to high-tax states.

## Additional Wyoming Tax Benefits for Veterans

### Sales Tax

Wyoming has a **4% state sales tax** with counties adding up to 2% (6% max total). This is lower than:
- Colorado: 2.9% state + up to 8.3% local = up to 11.2%
- Idaho: 6% state + up to 3% local = up to 9%
- Montana: 0% sales tax (Montana wins here)

**Exemptions:** Wyoming does not tax most groceries or prescription medications, saving veterans additional money on necessities.

### No Estate or Inheritance Tax

Wyoming has **no estate tax** or **inheritance tax**. Your heirs will receive your estate without state-level taxation, though federal estate tax may apply to estates over $13.61 million (2024).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### General Tax Questions

**Q: Do I have to file a state income tax return in Wyoming?**
A: No. Wyoming has no state income tax, so there is no state income tax return to file. You still must file a federal return.

**Q: Is military retirement pay taxed in Wyoming?**
A: No. Wyoming does not have a state income tax, so your military retirement pay is not taxed at the state level. It is still subject to federal income tax unless you have VA disability pay, which is federally tax-exempt.

**Q: Will Wyoming tax my VA disability compensation?**
A: No. VA disability compensation is tax-free at both federal and state levels in all 50 states.

**Q: Does Wyoming tax Social Security benefits?**
A: No. Wyoming has no state income tax, so Social Security benefits are not taxed at the state level.

**Q: How does Wyoming's zero income tax affect my TSP withdrawals?**
A: TSP withdrawals are not subject to Wyoming state income tax. However, they are still subject to federal income tax unless rolled over to another qualified retirement account.

### Property Tax Exemption Questions

**Q: I just moved to Wyoming. Can I claim the property tax exemption immediately?**
A: No. You must be a Wyoming resident for **three consecutive years** before you can claim the veteran property tax exemption.

**Q: I'm 30% service-connected disabled. Do I qualify for the property tax exemption?**
A: Yes. Any compensable VA disability rating qualifies you for the $6,000 property tax exemption, regardless of percentage. You do NOT need to meet the war period or medal requirements if you have a VA disability rating.

**Q: Can I apply the exemption to a rental property?**
A: No. The exemption only applies to your **primary residence**. If you do not own a primary residence, you can apply the exemption to your vehicle registration fee.

**Q: My spouse is not a veteran. Can we still claim the exemption?**
A: Yes. If you are married and you qualify as a veteran, the exemption applies to your jointly-owned primary residence.

**Q: What if I own multiple vehicles? Can I exempt more than one?**
A: No. The $6,000 exemption can only be applied to either your primary residence OR one vehicle—not multiple vehicles.

**Q: I missed the May deadline. Can I still apply?**
A: You can apply at any time, but the exemption will not take effect until the following tax year. Applications must be submitted by the fourth Monday of May to receive the exemption for that year.

**Q: Do I need to reapply every year?**
A: No. Once approved, the exemption continues automatically as long as you remain a Wyoming resident and continue to own the property or vehicle. However, some counties may require periodic re-verification.

**Q: I'm an unremarried surviving spouse of a veteran. Do I qualify?**
A: Yes. Unremarried surviving spouses of qualifying veterans may continue receiving the property tax exemption as long as they remain Wyoming residents and do not remarry.

### Disabled Veteran Questions

**Q: I'm 50% disabled. What benefits do I get beyond the property tax exemption?**
A: In addition to the $6,000 property tax exemption, 50% disabled veterans receive:
- Free lifetime fishing license
- Free vehicle registration for one vehicle
- Free lifetime Veteran's Pass for Wyoming State Parks (day use and camping)

**Q: I'm 100% disabled. What additional benefits do I receive?**
A: 100% disabled veterans receive:
- Free lifetime bird hunting, small game hunting, and fishing license
- Free vehicle registration for one vehicle
- Free disabled veteran license plates
- Free lifetime Veteran's Pass for Wyoming State Parks (day use and camping)

**Q: My disability rating increased from 40% to 60%. Do I need to notify anyone?**
A: Yes. Contact your County Assessor's Office and County Treasurer's Office to update your disability rating. This may qualify you for additional benefits like free vehicle registration.

**Q: Does 100% VA disability exempt me from all property taxes?**
A: No. The $6,000 assessed value exemption applies to all veterans, including 100% disabled veterans. Wyoming does not offer a full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans like some other states (e.g., Texas, Florida). However, you still receive significant benefits through free vehicle registration and other programs.

### Vehicle Registration Questions

**Q: Can I choose between the property tax exemption and vehicle registration exemption?**
A: Yes, but only if you qualify for the $6,000 veteran exemption (not the 50%+ disabled veteran free registration). If you are 50%+ disabled, you automatically get free registration for one vehicle PLUS the $6,000 property tax exemption on your home.

**Q: I have a 50% disability rating. Do I get both the property tax exemption AND free vehicle registration?**
A: Yes! The 50%+ disabled veteran free vehicle registration is separate from the $6,000 property tax exemption. You receive both benefits.

**Q: How do I apply for disabled veteran license plates?**
A: Visit your County Treasurer's Office with:
- DD Form 214
- VA disability rating letter showing 50%+ rating
- Proof of vehicle ownership
- Proof of Wyoming residency

**Q: Can I transfer my disabled veteran plates to a new vehicle?**
A: Yes. Contact your County Treasurer's Office to transfer the plates to your new vehicle. There is no fee for the transfer.

**Q: I was a POW. What benefits do I receive?**
A: Former POWs receive:
- Free vehicle registration for one vehicle (POW license plates)
- $6,000 property tax exemption
- Free lifetime bird hunting, small game hunting, and fishing license

### Comparison Questions

**Q: Should I move to Wyoming or Montana for tax benefits?**
A: **Wyoming** is better for most veterans due to zero state income tax. However, **Montana** is better for 100% disabled veterans who qualify for 50%-100% property tax reductions based on income. Run the numbers for your specific situation.

**Q: Is Wyoming or Idaho better for veterans tax-wise?**
A: **Wyoming** is better for veterans under 65 and those who work part-time in retirement. **Idaho** is competitive for retirees 65+ or disabled veterans 62+ who no longer have earned income. Wyoming's zero income tax saves more money over a full retirement.

**Q: I'm retiring from the military at age 42. Which state should I choose?**
A: **Wyoming**. If you plan to work in your 40s and 50s (which most military retirees do), Wyoming's zero income tax will save you tens of thousands of dollars compared to states with income tax. The property tax exemption is a bonus.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled and 67 years old. Should I move to Wyoming?**
A: Wyoming is excellent, but also consider **Texas** or **Florida** if you're 100% disabled. Both states offer full property tax exemptions for 100% disabled veterans. However, Wyoming's superior outdoor recreation, lower cost of living than many parts of Texas/Florida, and veteran-friendly culture make it highly competitive.

## Final Thoughts: Wyoming's Tax Advantage for Veterans

Wyoming's zero state income tax is a **game-changer** for military retirees. Combined with the $6,000 property tax exemption and special benefits for disabled veterans, Wyoming ranks among the **top 5 most tax-friendly states** for veterans in America.

**Best For:**
- Veterans who plan to work part-time or full-time in retirement (zero income tax maximizes your earnings)
- Military retirees under age 65 (some states only offer tax breaks for older retirees)
- Veterans who value outdoor recreation and low population density
- Disabled veterans (50%+ rating) who benefit from free vehicle registration, hunting/fishing licenses, and state park access

**Consider Alternatives If:**
- You're 100% disabled and want full property tax exemption (Texas, Florida, South Dakota offer this)
- You're 65+ and not working (Idaho becomes competitive due to full military retirement exemption + lower property taxes)
- You prefer urban amenities (Wyoming's largest city, Cheyenne, has only ~65,000 people)

**The Bottom Line:** For most veterans, Wyoming's tax benefits are unbeatable. Over a 20-30 year retirement, you'll save **$100,000 to $200,000** compared to high-tax states—money that stays in your pocket for what matters most.

Welcome to Wyoming. Thank you for your service.
