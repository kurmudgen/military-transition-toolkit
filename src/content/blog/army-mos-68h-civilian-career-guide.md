## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 68H Optical Laboratory Specialists transitioning out—you're not just leaving the military, you're entering a specialized healthcare field with strong demand and excellent job security. Your **optical laboratory technical skills, lens surfacing and fabrication, spectacle assembly and repair, frame fitting and adjustment, optical measurements and calculations, precision equipment operation, quality control, and patient eyewear dispensing experience** make you highly competitive for civilian optician and optical laboratory technician positions. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$38,000-$55,000** for entry-level optical lab technician or dispensing optician positions, scaling to **$55,000-$75,000** with ABO-NCLE certification and 3-5 years experience. Licensed opticians in high-demand states can earn **$65,000-$85,000+**, while optical laboratory managers command **$70,000-$95,000+**. You've got options—choose strategically.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every 68H separating hears two opposite narratives: "Your optical skills are highly specialized and directly transferable," and "Civilian optical retail is completely different from military optometry clinics."

Both are partially true. Here's the reality: **Your 68H technical laboratory skills translate directly to civilian optical work—but you need state optician licensure and ABO-NCLE certification to practice as a dispensing optician in most states.**

You didn't just "make glasses." You:
- Fabricated and surfaced prescription lenses using single vision and multifocal lens blank processing
- Assembled, adjusted, and repaired eyeglasses and spectacles to precise optical specifications
- Operated optical laboratory equipment including lensometers, lens edgers, pattern makers, and drill presses
- Measured and verified prescription parameters, optical centers, segment heights, and pupillary distance
- Fitted and dispensed eyewear to patients, ensuring proper fit, comfort, and optical correction
- Interpreted and executed written prescriptions from optometrists and ophthalmologists
- Performed frame selection, adjustment, and repair for diverse patient needs
- Maintained quality control standards ensuring all eyewear met optical specifications and safety standards
- Managed optical laboratory inventory, equipment maintenance, and supply ordering
- Applied coating treatments (scratch-resistant, anti-reflective, UV protection) to finished lenses

That's optical engineering, precision craftsmanship, patient care, and technical healthcare expertise. The civilian optical industry desperately needs these skills—you just need state licensure (in states that require it) and industry-recognized certifications that employers value.

## Best civilian career paths for Army 68H Optical Laboratory Specialists

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where 68H specialists consistently land, with real 2024-2025 salary data.

**Certifications and licensing needed:**
- **ABO (American Board of Opticianry) Certification:** National certification in spectacle dispensing. Cost: $225 for exam. Study time: 2-4 months. Pass rate: 75-80%. Army COOL program may fund this.
- **NCLE (National Contact Lens Examiners) Certification:** National certification in contact lens dispensing. Cost: $225 for exam. Study time: 2-3 months. Pass rate: 70-75%. Recommended if dispensing contact lenses.
- **State Optician License:** Required in 23 states (CA, MA, NY, FL, NC, TX, NJ, etc.). Requirements vary—some require ABO/NCLE plus supervised experience (2 years), others require formal opticianry programs. Check your state board.
- **Associate degree in Opticianry:** Required in some states for licensure. Cost: $0 with GI Bill (2-year degree). May not be necessary if your state accepts military training + ABO certification.

**Reality check:**
Your 68H training covers 90% of what civilian opticians do. The main difference: Civilian opticians spend more time on sales, frame selection, fashion consultation, and customer service than military opticians who focused primarily on technical fabrication and dispensing.

State licensing varies dramatically:
- **23 states require optician licensure** (stricter requirements—formal education or extensive apprenticeship + ABO/NCLE certification)
- **27 states have no licensing requirements** (you can work as optician with ABO certification and experience)

Your pathway depends on where you want to work:

**No-license states (TX, FL, MI, OH, WI, etc.):** Get ABO certification ($225), apply directly to optical retailers (LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, private practices). Start working immediately at $40K-$55K.

**License-required states (CA, MA, NY, NC, NJ, CT, etc.):** More complex. Some states accept military training + ABO certification + supervised work experience. Others require formal 2-year opticianry degree. Research your specific state requirements at your state optometry board website.

The ABO-NCLE certifications significantly increase earning potential—certified opticians earn $8K-$15K more annually than non-certified opticians. The exams are challenging but very passable with your 68H background.

Army COOL (Credentialing Opportunities On-Line) program funds ABO-NCLE certification exams. Apply during your final year of service to get exams paid for before separation.

**Best for:** 68H specialists who enjoyed patient interaction and eyewear dispensing, want stable employment in healthcare retail, and are willing to obtain ABO-NCLE certification and state licensure (if required).

### Optical Laboratory Technician (pure technical path)

**Reality check:**
Optical laboratory technician work is behind-the-scenes manufacturing—no patient contact, no sales pressure, pure technical fabrication. If you loved the laboratory side of 68H work more than patient dispensing, this is your path.

The work environment is manufacturing/production-focused: You'll operate lens surfacing equipment, edgers, and finishing machinery in a laboratory setting, producing 30-50 pairs of glasses daily to precise optical specifications.

Pay starts lower ($32K-$42K) than dispensing optician roles, but there's less stress, no sales quotas, and predictable shift work (often day shifts, some facilities operate 24/7 with shift differentials).

Large commercial optical laboratories (Essilor, VSP Labs, National Vision) hire military veterans and appreciate your technical precision, attention to detail, and equipment operation experience.

Career progression: Start as lab technician ($35K-$45K), advance to senior technician or specialized role (progressive lenses, coatings, drilling) ($45K-$60K), then laboratory supervisor or manager ($60K-$80K).

Remote/rural optical labs sometimes struggle to find qualified technicians and offer relocation bonuses or higher starting salaries ($45K-$55K) to attract talent.

**Best for:** 68H specialists who preferred laboratory fabrication work over patient interaction, want manufacturing/technical careers, and prefer predictable shifts without sales pressure.

### Corporate Optical Retail Chains (fastest hiring path)

**Major employers actively hiring 68H veterans:**

- **State optician license:** Required if working in licensing states
- **Company will sponsor training:** Most chains provide ABO exam prep and pay for certification

**Reality check:**
Corporate optical chains hire 68H specialists quickly (often 1-3 weeks from application to hire) because they have high staffing needs and structured training programs.

LensCrafters and Pearle Vision (both owned by EssilorLuxottica) specifically recruit veterans and understand military optical training. They won't make you "prove yourself"—your 68H credentials are recognized.

Costco Optical pays significantly better than competitors ($45K-$60K starting vs. $36K-$50K) and offers union benefits, but positions are more competitive and harder to get.

The work is retail-focused: You'll fit eyewear, adjust frames, make sales, meet productivity targets, and provide customer service. Expect to work weekends, evenings, and holidays (retail hours).

Sales quotas exist at some chains (LensCrafters has productivity metrics), but it's softer sales—helping patients choose frames and lens options, not aggressive upselling.

Benefits are competitive: Health insurance, 401k matching, paid time off (15-20 days), employee eyewear discounts (free or heavily discounted glasses), and tuition reimbursement ($3,000-$5,000/year at LensCrafters).

Career advancement is realistic: Start as optician ($38K-$50K), advance to senior optician or optical supervisor ($50K-$62K), then store optical manager ($55K-$75K) within 3-5 years. Some advance to district management ($70K-$95K+).

**Best for:** 68H specialists who need employment quickly, don't mind retail work environments, want structured training and benefits, and plan to advance through internal promotions.

### Private Optometry Practices (higher earning potential)

**Civilian job titles:**

- Inventory management and ordering

**Certifications needed:**
- **ABO-NCLE certifications:** Essential for private practices
- **State optician license:** Required in licensing states
- **Specialty certifications:** Low vision, pediatric opticianry, sports vision (optional but valuable)

**Reality check:**
Private optometry practices pay better than retail chains ($45K-$65K vs. $36K-$50K starting) but are harder to break into without civilian experience and certifications.

Private practice opticians work closely with optometrists and ophthalmologists, often in upscale environments serving patients who value personalized service and are willing to pay premium prices for designer frames and specialized lenses.

The work is more consultative and less production-focused than retail chains. You'll spend 20-40 minutes with each patient selecting frames, explaining lens options, taking precise measurements, and ensuring perfect fit and vision correction.

High-end practices (serving affluent patients) pay premium salaries ($60K-$85K) for experienced opticians who excel at customer service, have extensive product knowledge, and can fit complex prescriptions (high prescriptions, prisms, progressive lenses).

Many private practices are near military bases or in communities with large veteran populations. These practices understand 68H training and actively recruit military-trained opticians.

Small private practices (1-2 optometrists) often hire opticians for multiple roles—dispensing, laboratory work, frame styling, practice administration—making your comprehensive 68H training especially valuable.

**Best for:** 68H specialists with ABO-NCLE certifications, strong interpersonal skills, interest in high-end optical products, and willingness to build relationships with private practice owners through networking and targeted job applications.

### VA Healthcare System (best benefits and job security)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Optician (GS-5 to GS-7)
- Senior Optician (GS-7 to GS-9)
- Optical Laboratory Technician (GS-5 to GS-7)
- Optical Services Supervisor (GS-9 to GS-11)

**Salary ranges:**
- **GS-5 Optician:** $36,000-$47,000 (varies by locality)
- **GS-6 Optician:** $40,000-$52,000
- **GS-7 Senior Optician:** $44,000-$57,000
- **GS-9 Optical Services Specialist:** $54,000-$70,000
- **GS-11 Optical Services Supervisor:** $66,000-$85,000
- **With locality pay adjustments:** Add 15-35% in high-cost areas (DC, NYC, SF, LA)

**What translates directly:**
- All 68H optical technical and dispensing skills
- Military medical system understanding
- Veteran patient care and communication
- Security clearance (if still active—advantage for VA hiring)
- Veteran preference in federal hiring (5-10 point preference)

**Certifications needed:**
- **ABO-NCLE certifications:** Preferred but not always required for entry-level VA positions
- **Federal background check:** Standard for VA employment
- **State license:** Not required for federal employment (VA operates under federal jurisdiction)

**Reality check:**
VA optical services positions take longer to land (3-6 months application to hire) but offer exceptional federal benefits: FEHB health insurance, FERS pension, TSP matching (5%), 13-26 days annual leave, 13 days sick leave, 11 federal holidays, job security, and clear promotion paths.

As a veteran, you get hiring preference. If you're a disabled veteran (10% or higher VA rating), you get 10-point preference, putting you at the top of hiring lists.

VA optical clinics serve veteran patients who deeply appreciate working with fellow veterans. Your 68H military background and understanding of veteran needs (combat-related vision injuries, PTSD considerations, prosthetic eyes, specialized low-vision devices) make you uniquely qualified.

The GS pay scale provides predictable advancement: Start at GS-5 or GS-6 ($36K-$52K), promote to GS-7 after 1 year ($44K-$57K), then GS-9 with ABO-NCLE certifications and good performance ($54K-$70K). With experience, advance to GS-11 supervisor ($66K-$85K) within 5-8 years.

The federal pension is substantial: Work 20+ years, retire with pension paying 40-60% of your high-3 salary, plus TSP with compound growth, plus Social Security. That's a secure retirement comparable to military pension.

VA also offers student loan repayment (up to $10,000/year for hard-to-fill positions), relocation allowances, and tuition assistance for continuing education.

**Best for:** 68H specialists who want job security, excellent benefits, to serve veteran populations, and prefer federal employment structure over private sector higher salaries.

### Specialized Optical Careers (niche high-paying paths)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Low Vision Specialist
- Ophthalmic Product Representative (sales)
- Optical Equipment Trainer
- Ophthalmic Photographer
- Vision Rehabilitation Specialist

**Salary ranges:**
- **Low Vision Specialist:** $55,000-$75,000

- **ABO-NCLE certifications:** Foundation credentials
- **CLVT (Certified Low Vision Therapist):** For low vision specialty. Cost: $500-$800.
- **Bachelor's degree:** Often required or preferred for sales and training roles
- **Specialty training:** Provided by employers for equipment sales/training positions

**Reality check:**
These specialized paths require 3-5+ years of civilian optical experience before you're competitive. They're not entry-level positions but represent long-term career goals.

**Low vision specialists** work with patients who have significant vision impairment (macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma) who need specialized low-vision aids, magnifiers, and rehabilitation training. Rewarding work helping patients maintain independence despite vision loss.

**Ophthalmic sales representatives** work for lens manufacturers (Essilor, Hoya, Zeiss, Shamir) or frame companies (Luxottica, Safilo, Marchon) selling products to optical retailers and practices. High earning potential ($60K-$95K+ with commissions) but requires sales skills and extensive travel.

**Optical equipment trainers** teach opticians and practices how to use new optical technology (digital lens systems, 3D frame fitting, lens coatings). Your 68H technical expertise and teaching experience (if you trained junior soldiers) positions you well for this path.

**Best for:** 68H specialists with long-term optical career vision, willingness to build 3-5 years civilian experience in traditional optician roles, and interest in advancing to specialized high-paying niches.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and Army COOL funding as a 68H transitioning out:

### High priority (get these):

**ABO (American Board of Opticianry) Certification - Spectacle Dispensing** - Industry-standard national certification recognized by all employers. Cost: $225 for exam. Study time: 2-4 months self-study using ABO prep books ($50-$150). Pass rate: 75-80%. Value: Required or strongly preferred by all optical employers. Increases salary $8K-$15K over non-certified opticians. Army COOL program funds this—apply 6-12 months before separation.

**NCLE (National Contact Lens Examiners) Certification - Contact Lens Dispensing** - National certification for contact lens fitting and dispensing. Cost: $225 for exam. Study time: 2-3 months. Pass rate: 70-75%. Value: Required if you want to fit/dispense contact lenses. Adds $3K-$8K to salary. Also covered by Army COOL.

**State Optician License (if in licensing-required state)** - Required in 23 states to practice as optician. Requirements vary by state—most require ABO-NCLE plus 2 years supervised experience or formal opticianry degree. Cost: $100-$300 application fee. Time: Varies (some states accept military training, others require civilian apprenticeship). Value: Non-negotiable if working in CA, MA, NY, FL, NC, NJ, CT, VA, RI, or other licensing states.

### Medium priority (if it fits your career path):

**Associate degree in Opticianry** - 2-year degree from accredited opticianry program. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 2 years. Value: Required for licensure in some states (CA, MA require degree OR extensive experience). Strengthens credentials for management positions. Consider if you're young and want long-term optical career. Schools: Hillsborough Community College (FL), GateWay Community College (AZ), Seattle Central College (WA).

**Advanced ABO certifications:**
- **Master in Ophthalmic Optics:** Advanced ABO credential. Cost: $275. Value: Demonstrates expertise, qualifies for senior optician roles.
- **Contact Lens Registry (NCLE advanced):** Specialty contact lens fitting. Cost: $225. Value: Positions you for specialty contact lens practices.

**CLVT (Certified Low Vision Therapist)** - If pursuing low vision specialty. Cost: $500-$800 for training + certification. Time: 6-12 months. Value: Opens doors to $55K-$75K low vision specialist positions. Consider after 3-5 years civilian experience.

### Lower priority (helpful but not critical):

**Optical Management Certificate** - Business operations for optical practices. Cost: $500-$1,500. Value: Helpful for management track but not required; on-the-job experience matters more.

**Certified Ophthalmic Assistant (COA)** - Entry-level certification for ophthalmic technicians working in ophthalmology practices. Cost: $225-$300. Value: Useful if transitioning to clinical ophthalmic assisting rather than optical dispensing.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be brutally honest. There are civilian skills you don't have:

**Sales and retail business:** Military optical clinics don't have sales quotas, profit targets, or competitive retail environments. Civilian optical retail is driven by sales—frame selection involves fashion consulting, lifestyle needs assessment, and upselling premium lens options (anti-reflective coating, blue light protection, photochromic lenses). You'll need to develop consultative sales skills without being pushy.

**Fashion and frame styling:** Military eyewear focuses on function and durability (mostly conservative frames, limited style options). Civilian optical retail emphasizes fashion, trends, and personal style. You'll need to learn frame styling for different face shapes, skin tones, lifestyles, and fashion preferences.

**Insurance and payment systems:** Military optometry is free for service members and beneficiaries. Civilian optical involves processing vision insurance (VSP, EyeMed, Davis Vision), understanding coverage and copays, and handling patient out-of-pocket costs. You'll need to learn insurance eligibility verification and benefits explanation.

**Customer service in competitive retail:** Military patients had limited choice in eyewear providers. Civilian patients shop around, read online reviews, and can go elsewhere if dissatisfied. You'll need refined customer service skills, patience with demanding customers, and focus on patient retention.

**Advanced lens technologies:** Civilian optical has exploded with new lens technologies—digital free-form progressive lenses, blue light filtering, computer-specific lenses, Transitions adaptive lenses, polarized lenses for specific activities. You'll need continuing education to stay current on product innovations.

## Bottom line for Army 68H Optical Laboratory Specialists

Your 68H experience isn't just valuable—it's highly specialized technical expertise that civilian optical employers desperately need.

You've proven you can fabricate precision optical lenses, operate complex laboratory equipment, fit and dispense eyewear to exacting standards, interpret prescriptions accurately, and provide technical optical care to diverse patient populations. The civilian optical industry needs these specialized skills—you just need ABO-NCLE certifications and state licensure (if required) to maximize your earning potential.

Corporate optical retail, private optometry practices, VA optical services, and optical laboratory careers are proven paths. Thousands of 68H specialists have successfully transitioned before you. You're not starting from zero—you're ahead of civilian opticianry graduates who spent 2 years in school while you spent years fabricating real eyewear for real patients.

First-year income of $38K-$52K is realistic for entry-level positions without certifications; $45K-$60K with ABO-NCLE certifications. Within 3-5 years, $55K-$75K is achievable in retail management or private practice. If you advance to optical management or specialized fields (sales, low vision), $70K-$95K+ is within reach.

Your optical technical expertise, patient care experience, and 68H credentials are assets. Get your ABO-NCLE certifications (Army COOL pays for them), target military-friendly employers, obtain state licensure if required, and be strategic about your career path.

You've accomplished harder things than this transition. Execute the plan.
