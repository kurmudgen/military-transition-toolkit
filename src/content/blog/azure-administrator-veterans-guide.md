## What Is Azure Administrator Certification?

The Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification validates your skills in implementing, managing, and monitoring Azure cloud environments. You'll demonstrate expertise in compute, storage, networking, and security services—everything needed to manage enterprise Azure infrastructure.

Microsoft Azure holds the second-largest cloud market share (23%) and dominates in enterprises with existing Microsoft infrastructure. Many government and DoD organizations use Azure Government, making this certification especially valuable for veterans.

## Why Veterans Excel in Azure Administration

Military experience aligns with Azure administration:

**Microsoft familiarity:** If you used NIPR, you used Microsoft. Active Directory, Windows Server, Office 365—Azure extends what you already know.

**Enterprise IT experience:** Military IT operations at scale. Azure administration is enterprise IT in the cloud.

**Security and compliance:** Azure Government and DoD environments require cleared administrators who understand security—that's you.

**Change management:** Military changes require approval processes. Azure governance tools implement similar controls.

**Documentation:** Azure emphasizes Infrastructure as Code and documentation—skills military SOPs develop.
