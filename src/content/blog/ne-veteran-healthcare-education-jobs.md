# Nebraska Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Nebraska's VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System operates three major medical facilities—Omaha, Lincoln, and Grand Island—plus six community-based outpatient clinics, providing coverage to about 90% of veterans within 40 miles of VA care. The system has seen significant improvements, with Omaha reporting some of its best wait times in years for primary and specialty care.

For education, the University of Nebraska system (Omaha and Lincoln campuses) both participate in the Yellow Ribbon program with unlimited spots, meaning 100% Post-9/11 GI Bill eligible students pay zero out-of-pocket tuition. Nebraska also offers the Waiver of Tuition program for dependents of eligible veterans—one of the best state-level education benefits in the Midwest, covering up to 100% of tuition at state schools.

The job market is strong with veteran unemployment around 2.7% (matching Nebraska's overall 2.8% unemployment rate, one of the lowest in the nation). Offutt Air Force Base drives significant veteran hiring in the Omaha metro, and state jobs offer veterans a 5-10 point preference on hiring exams.

Overall rating: **8/10** for healthcare access, **9/10** for education benefits, **8.5/10** for employment opportunities. Nebraska punches above its weight for a smaller state, especially in education benefits and job market strength.

## VA Healthcare System

Lincoln's clinic isn't a full medical center, but it handles most outpatient needs so veterans in the Lincoln area don't have to drive to Omaha for routine care. The Express Care Clinic (opened 2022) handles same-day urgent care for issues like minor injuries, flu, infections.

### Outpatient Clinics

**Norfolk VA Clinic**
- Location: 3204 Raasch Drive, Norfolk, NE 68701-3455
- Phone: (402) 844-8000
- Services: Primary care, mental health, telehealth

These community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) provide primary care and mental health services closer to home for veterans in smaller cities. They're ideal for routine care, prescriptions, and mental health counseling.

### Vet Centers

Vet Centers provide confidential counseling for combat veterans, sexual trauma survivors, and bereaved families—separate from the VA medical system.

**Omaha Vet Center**

**Crisis Support:** Call or text 988, then press 1 for Veterans Crisis Line (24/7 support).

Vet Centers are non-medical, community-based—many veterans prefer them over VA hospitals for mental health care because they feel less institutional.

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- About 90% of Nebraska veterans live within 40 miles of a VA facility or clinic
- Urban access (Omaha, Lincoln): Excellent—multiple facilities
- Rural access: Good for primary care via CBOCs; specialty care requires travel to Omaha or Grand Island

**Quality Ratings:**
- Omaha VAMC: Above average nationally (3.5 stars)
- Grand Island: Average (3 stars)
- Patient satisfaction scores are improving year-over-year

**Wait Times:**
- Nebraska VA wait times have improved significantly since 2022
- Primary care: 10-20 days (meets VA's 20-day standard)
- Mental health: 15-25 days
- Specialty care: 25-35 days (varies by specialty—cardiology and orthopedics are longer)

**Areas for improvement:** Specialty care wait times in Omaha can stretch longer during peak demand. Community Care referrals are available if VA can't schedule within 28 days.

### Community Care (Non-VA Options)

If the VA can't provide timely care, you may be eligible for Community Care (formerly Veterans Choice Program):

- **Eligibility:** If you live 40+ miles from a VA facility, wait times exceed 28 days, or VA doesn't offer the service you need
- **Process:** Your VA provider submits a Community Care referral; VA authorizes care at a civilian provider
- **Cost:** Covered by VA (you may have copays depending on your eligibility)

Nebraska has a robust network of Community Care providers, especially in Omaha and Lincoln. You can see civilian doctors, specialists, and hospitals if VA care isn't accessible.

**TRICARE (for retirees):** If you're a military retiree, you may have TRICARE coverage. Nebraska has good TRICARE network availability in urban areas.

## Education Benefits

### Top GI Bill Schools

**University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)**
- Location: Lincoln, NE
- Veteran enrollment: 800+ student veterans
- Yellow Ribbon: Yes—unlimited students, unlimited contribution (covers full out-of-state tuition)
- BAH Rate (2024-25): ~$1,600/month (E-5 with dependents rate for Lincoln zip code)
- In-state tuition: $8,700/year | Out-of-state: $26,720/year
- GI Bill coverage: 100% with Yellow Ribbon (zero out-of-pocket for eligible students)

UNL is Nebraska's flagship university and a top choice for veterans. The Yellow Ribbon program covers the gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition, so 100% Post-9/11 GI Bill users pay nothing. The campus has strong support services and an active student veteran community.

**University of Nebraska-Omaha (UNO)**
- Location: Omaha, NE
- Veteran enrollment: 1,000+ using VA/military benefits

UNO serves a lot of non-traditional students, including active duty at Offutt AFB and working veterans. The aviation program is nationally recognized. The lower graduation rate reflects the student body (many attend part-time), not quality.

### State Education Benefits

**Waiver of Tuition Program**

This is Nebraska's standout state benefit. Dependents (spouse or children) of eligible veterans can receive up to 100% tuition waiver at University of Nebraska campuses, Nebraska state colleges, and community colleges.

- **Eligibility:** You must be the dependent of a veteran who:
  - Died in service or from a service-connected disability, OR
  - Is permanently and totally disabled (100% P&T), OR
  - Is a POW or MIA, OR
  - Received the Medal of Honor
- **Benefit:** Up to 100% of tuition charges waived (does not cover fees, books, or room/board)
- **Duration:** One degree/diploma/certificate from a community college AND one baccalaureate degree from a state college or university
- **Residency:** Dependent must be a Nebraska resident and eligible for in-state tuition
- **Application:** Apply through Nebraska Department of Veterans' Affairs before the start of each term

**Example value:** If your child attends UNL for 4 years, this waiver saves $34,800 (in-state tuition). Combined with Pell Grants, scholarships, and your Post-9/11 GI Bill transfer, your kid can graduate debt-free.

**Reservist Tuition Credit**

Nebraska National Guard and Reserve members get a 75% tuition credit (50% for graduate/professional degrees) at state schools while actively serving in a Nebraska-based unit.

- **Eligibility:** Member of Active Selected Reserve in a Nebraska-based unit
- **Benefit:** 75% off tuition (undergraduate), 50% off (graduate)
- **Where:** University of Nebraska, state colleges, community colleges
- **Stacks with:** Federal Tuition Assistance (TA)—use TA first, then get 75% credit on the remainder

**Example:** UNL in-state tuition is $8,700/year. Federal TA covers $4,500. Remaining $4,200 gets 75% credit = $3,150 discount. Out-of-pocket: $1,050/year.

### Community Colleges

Nebraska has a strong community college system—great for veterans looking to save money, get certifications, or transfer to a 4-year school.

**Metropolitan Community College (MCC)** - Omaha
