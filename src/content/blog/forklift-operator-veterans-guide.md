## What Is Forklift Certification?

Forklift certification is OSHA-mandated training that authorizes you to operate powered industrial trucks (forklifts, pallet jacks, order pickers, etc.). Every employer is required to certify their forklift operators.

**Key Points:**
- Certification is employer-specific (not portable between employers)
- Each new employer must verify training
- Recertification required every 3 years minimum
- OSHA can fine employers for uncertified operators

## Types of Forklifts

### Classes of Powered Industrial Trucks

**Class I:** Electric Motor Rider Trucks (sit-down electric)
**Class II:** Electric Motor Narrow Aisle Trucks (reach, order picker)
**Class III:** Electric Motor Hand or Hand/Rider Trucks (pallet jacks)
**Class IV:** Internal Combustion Engine Trucks (cushion tire)
**Class V:** Internal Combustion Engine Trucks (pneumatic tire)
**Class VI:** Electric and IC Engine Tractors
**Class VII:** Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks (construction)

Each class requires specific training for that equipment type.

## Why Veterans Excel in Forklift Operations

Military logistics experience transfers directly:

**Equipment operation:** You've likely operated military forklifts or similar equipment.

**Warehouse experience:** Military supply operations parallel civilian warehousing.

**Safety discipline:** OSHA safety requirements align with military safety culture.

**Physical capability:** Warehouse work can be demanding—military fitness helps.

**Reliability:** Employers value military punctuality and work ethic.

## Certification Requirements

### OSHA 29 CFR 1910.178 Requirements
Every forklift operator must receive:
1. **Formal instruction:** Lecture, discussion, written materials, video
2. **Practical training:** Demonstrations, exercises
3. **Evaluation:** Observed operating in workplace conditions

### Certification Process
1. Complete training program (classroom + hands-on)
