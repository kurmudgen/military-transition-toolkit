# Military to Diplomatic Security: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) offers veterans elite law enforcement careers with starting salaries of $55,000-$75,000 and senior agents earning $130,000-$180,000+. As the security and law enforcement arm of the State Department, DSS agents protect diplomats, investigate passport/visa fraud, and manage embassy security worldwide. Your military experience, especially overseas service and security backgrounds, translates directly. Veterans receive hiring preference, and your security clearances expedite processing. The application process takes 12-18 months, so plan accordingly.

## Why Veterans Excel in Diplomatic Security

Military overseas experience provides cultural awareness and comfort operating internationally. DSS agents spend significant portions of careers abroad—your deployment experience is relevant.

Your existing security clearances are essential. DSS requires TS/SCI clearance, which you may already hold.

Understanding of threat environments from military service applies to embassy security. You've assessed and operated in hostile environments.

Physical fitness and tactical training provide foundation for DSS operations. Protective operations require capable agents.

Your ability to work independently in challenging locations aligns with DSS assignments. Agents often serve as Regional Security Officers with significant autonomy.

Discipline and professionalism from military service meet State Department's exacting standards. Diplomatic environments require impeccable conduct.
