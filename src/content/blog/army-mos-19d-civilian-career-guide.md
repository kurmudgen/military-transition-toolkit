## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 19D Cavalry Scouts transitioning out—your **reconnaissance expertise, intelligence gathering, terrain analysis, navigation proficiency, mounted/dismounted operations, crew leadership, surveillance skills, and ability to operate independently in high-threat environments** make you competitive across law enforcement, intelligence analysis, surveying/mapping, skilled trades, logistics, and private security. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$75,000** in law enforcement, technical fields, or trades, scaling to **$90,000-$150,000** in federal law enforcement, intelligence analysis, or specialized technical roles. Private contracting, advanced technical positions, and security management can earn **$120,000-$180,000+**.

You didn't just "drive around looking for the enemy"—you conducted reconnaissance and surveillance missions in hostile territory, gathered and reported intelligence, analyzed terrain and enemy activity, operated complex vehicle and communications systems, navigated using maps and GPS, called for indirect fire support, worked independently with minimal supervision, and made tactical decisions that shaped battalion-level operations. That's intelligence analysis, geospatial analysis, technical proficiency, autonomous decision-making, and operational coordination. The civilian world needs those skills—you just need to target industries where reconnaissance and analysis experience translates to operational value.

Most 19D scouts transition to law enforcement (especially investigative roles), intelligence analysis (government/defense contractors), surveying and mapping (GIS analyst, land surveyor), skilled trades (heavy equipment, mechanics), transportation/logistics, or private security. Your transition timeline is 6-12 months with strategic planning. Start 9-12 months before ETS.

## What Does an Army 19D Cavalry Scout Do?

As a 19D Cavalry Scout, you operated as the "eyes and ears" of the commander, conducting reconnaissance and surveillance missions to gather enemy information and terrain intelligence. You operated in Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Strykers, or HMMWVs, conducting mounted and dismounted patrols, establishing observation posts, reporting enemy activity, conducting route reconnaissance, gathering intelligence, calling for fire support, and operating independently or in small teams often miles ahead of the main force.

Your role required proficiency in:
- **Vehicle operations:** Driving and maintaining combat vehicles in difficult terrain
- **Navigation:** Map reading, GPS operation, terrain association
- **Communications:** Operating multiple radio systems, clear and concise reporting
- **Surveillance:** Observing and reporting enemy activity, pattern analysis
- **Weapons systems:** Operating vehicle-mounted weapons (M240, M2 .50 cal, TOW missiles)
- **Intelligence gathering:** Collecting, analyzing, and reporting tactical intelligence
- **Crew coordination:** Working as Bradley/Stryker crew member or team leader
- **Independent operations:** Operating with minimal supervision in high-risk environments

You developed technical proficiency, analytical skills, attention to detail, self-discipline, situational awareness, and the ability to make critical decisions independently while under fire.

## Resume Translation: Scout Skills to Civilian Language

**Instead of:** "19D Cavalry Scout"
**Write:** "Reconnaissance specialist with expertise in intelligence gathering, surveillance operations, terrain analysis, and vehicle operations in high-threat environments"

**Instead of:** "Conducted reconnaissance missions"
**Write:** "Gathered and analyzed intelligence in hostile environments; documented findings and provided detailed reports to leadership for operational decision-making"

**Instead of:** "Operated Bradley Fighting Vehicle/Stryker"
**Write:** "Operated and maintained $6M combat vehicle systems; navigated complex terrain using GPS and map-reading skills; coordinated 4-person crew operations"

**Instead of:** "Reported enemy activity"
**Write:** "Collected, analyzed, and reported tactical intelligence to battalion leadership; identified patterns and threats enabling mission success"

**Instead of:** "Maintained vehicles and equipment"
**Write:** "Performed preventive and corrective maintenance on heavy vehicle systems valued at $6M+; ensured 98% operational readiness rate"

**Quantify Everything:**
- "Conducted 200+ reconnaissance missions providing intelligence for battalion-level operations"
- "Operated $6M vehicle systems across 15,000+ miles of terrain with zero accidents"
- "Gathered intelligence resulting in 50+ enemy interdictions and mission successes"
- "Maintained 98% vehicle readiness rate across 3-year period"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Limiting Yourself to "Scout" Jobs:** Your skills transfer broadly—law enforcement, intelligence, surveying, trades
2. **Underselling Your Intelligence Skills:** You're an analyst, not just a "driver"
3. **Not Leveraging Clearance:** If you have clearance, target intel analyst roles ASAP
4. **Waiting Too Late:** Start 9-12 months out; federal processes take 12-18 months
5. **Skipping Technical Certifications:** GIS, CDL, surveying certs open doors
6. **Not Networking:** Connect with scouts who transitioned successfully
