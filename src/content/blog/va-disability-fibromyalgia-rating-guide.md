# VA Disability Rating for Fibromyalgia: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Fibromyalgia is rated under **Diagnostic Code 5025** with ratings of **10%, 20%, or 40%**. This is one of the few conditions with its own specific rating criteria rather than using general formulas. The key evidence is documented **widespread musculoskeletal pain** with **tender points** that require **continuous medication**. Fibromyalgia is commonly claimed by Gulf War veterans and can be presumptively service-connected as a Gulf War illness. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Fibromyalgia?

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. It affects how the brain processes pain signals.

**Primary symptoms:**
- Widespread pain (both sides of body, above and below waist)
- Fatigue
- "Fibro fog" (cognitive difficulties)
- Sleep disturbances

**Associated symptoms:**
- Tender points
- Morning stiffness
- Headaches
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Depression/anxiety
- Numbness/tingling
- Temperature sensitivity

**Military connections:**

**Direct service connection:**
- Physical and emotional trauma during service
- Chronic stress
- Sleep deprivation
- Viral infections during service

**Gulf War presumptive:**
Fibromyalgia is recognized as a Gulf War presumptive condition under 38 CFR § 3.317 for veterans who served in Southwest Asia and have:
- Chronic symptoms for 6+ months
- Symptoms manifested by December 31, 2026
- 10% or more disabling

**Secondary to:**
- PTSD (stress affects pain processing)
- TBI
- Other chronic pain conditions
- Sleep disorders

## VA Rating Criteria

Fibromyalgia is rated under **38 CFR § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5025**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points, with or without associated fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness, paresthesias, headache, irritable bowel symptoms, depression, anxiety, or Raynaud's-like symptoms, that requires continuous medication for control |
| **20%** | Symptoms that are episodic, with exacerbations often precipitated by environmental or emotional stress or by overexertion, but that are present more than one-third of the time |
| **40%** | Symptoms that are constant or nearly constant and refractory to therapy |

### Key Rating Factors

- **Continuous medication**: Must be taking medication regularly for control (supports 10%)
- **Episodic symptoms >1/3 of time**: Symptoms present more than one-third of time (supports 20%)
- **Constant and refractory**: Symptoms nearly constant despite treatment (supports 40%)

### Important Notes

- The 40% rating is the **maximum schedular rating** for fibromyalgia
- You cannot "pyramid" (receive separate ratings for) associated symptoms like IBS or depression if they're part of fibromyalgia
- However, if IBS or depression is from a separate cause, it may be rated separately

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence

**For direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing pain complaints
- Documentation of physical/emotional stressors
- Onset during or within reasonable time after service

**For Gulf War presumptive:**
- DD-214 showing Southwest Asia service
- Symptoms within presumptive period
- Documentation of chronic symptoms

**For secondary connection:**
- Service-connected condition
- Nexus opinion explaining connection

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Rheumatology evaluation confirming fibromyalgia
- Documentation of widespread pain
- Tender point examination
- Exclusion of other conditions

### Severity Evidence
- Medication records (critical)
- Treatment records
- Documentation of symptom frequency
- Failed treatments

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Examine tender points (historically 18 points—current criteria is widespread pain index)
3. Assess severity and frequency of symptoms
4. Review medications
5. Evaluate functional impairment

**What to tell them:**
- All areas of pain
- Symptom frequency (constant, episodic)
- Medications you take
- What triggers flare-ups
- Functional limitations

**Be thorough:** Mention all associated symptoms (fatigue, fog, IBS, headaches).

## Secondary Conditions

**If NOT rated as part of fibromyalgia:**
- Depression/anxiety (if from separate cause)
- Sleep disorders (if from separate cause)
- IBS (if from separate cause)

**Consider claiming fibromyalgia secondary to:**
- PTSD
- TBI
- Chronic pain conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is fibromyalgia presumptive for Gulf War veterans?
Yes. If you served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War and have fibromyalgia that manifested by December 31, 2026, and is at least 10% disabling, it's presumptively service-connected.

### What's the maximum rating for fibromyalgia?
40% is the maximum under DC 5025. However, you may have other conditions rated separately if they're not part of the fibromyalgia diagnosis.

### Do I need to show tender points?
The traditional 18 tender point examination is less emphasized now. Current diagnosis focuses on widespread pain and associated symptoms. However, tender point examination may still be part of the VA exam.

### Can I claim fibromyalgia and PTSD?
Yes, both can be service-connected. If fibromyalgia is secondary to PTSD, you can receive separate ratings. However, overlapping symptoms (like depression) may only be rated once.

### What if my fibromyalgia is refractory (doesn't respond to treatment)?
This supports the maximum 40% rating. Document all treatments tried and their lack of effectiveness.
