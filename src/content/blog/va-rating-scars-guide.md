# VA Rating for Scars: How the VA Rates Disfigurement and Scarring (2025)

Scars from military service—whether from combat injuries, training accidents, or surgical procedures—can qualify for VA disability compensation. Ratings range from 0% to 80%, with the highest ratings going to disfiguring scars on the head, face, and neck.

Many veterans don't realize their scars are ratable, or they're told scars are just "cosmetic." But painful scars, scars that limit movement, and disfiguring scars all qualify for compensation.

## How the VA Rates Scars

The VA uses different diagnostic codes depending on scar location and characteristics:

### Head, Face, and Neck Scars (DC 7800)

These get the highest ratings because of disfigurement.

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | One characteristic of disfigurement |
| **30%** | Visible or palpable tissue loss AND gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features, OR two or three characteristics of disfigurement |
| **50%** | Visible or palpable tissue loss AND gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features, OR four or five characteristics of disfigurement |
| **80%** | Visible or palpable tissue loss AND gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features, OR six or more characteristics of disfigurement |

**8 Characteristics of Disfigurement:**

1. Scar 5 inches (13 cm) or more in length
2. Scar at least 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) wide at widest part
3. Surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation
4. Scar adherent to underlying tissue
5. Skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding 6 square inches (39 sq cm)
6. Skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly) in an area exceeding 6 square inches
7. Underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding 6 square inches
8. Skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding 6 square inches

### Burns Scars and Scars Not on Head/Face (DC 7801)

For deep non-linear scars not on head, face, or neck:

| Rating | Area Affected |
|--------|---------------|
| **10%** | Area of at least 6 square inches (39 sq cm) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq cm) |
| **20%** | Area of at least 12 square inches (77 sq cm) but less than 72 square inches (465 sq cm) |
| **30%** | Area of at least 72 square inches (465 sq cm) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq cm) |
| **40%** | Area of 144 square inches (929 sq cm) or greater |

### Superficial Non-Linear Scars (DC 7802)

For scars not associated with underlying soft tissue damage:

| Rating | Area Affected |
|--------|---------------|
| **10%** | Area of 144 square inches (929 sq cm) or greater |

### Painful or Unstable Scars (DC 7804)

This is often overlooked but very important:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | One or two scars that are unstable OR painful |
| **20%** | Three or four scars that are unstable OR painful |
| **30%** | Five or more scars that are unstable OR painful |

**Unstable scar**: Frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar

**Painful scar**: Painful on examination

**Key point**: An additional 10% can be added if one or more scars are both unstable AND painful.

### Scars Causing Limitation of Function (DC 7805)

If a scar limits movement or function, it should be rated under the appropriate diagnostic code for that body part.

Example: Scar on knee that limits knee flexion → rated under knee limitation of motion codes

## Combining Scar Ratings

You can receive multiple scar ratings:
- One rating for disfigurement (7800)
- Separate ratings for painful/unstable scars (7804)
- Additional rating if scar limits function (7805 → relevant body part code)

**Example**: Veteran with facial scar:
- 30% for disfigurement (two characteristics)
- 10% for painful scar
- **Combined: 37% → rounds to 40%**

## Common Types of Service-Connected Scars

### Combat Injury Scars
- Shrapnel wounds
- Gunshot wounds
- Blast injuries (IEDs)
- Burns

### Surgical Scars
- Orthopedic surgeries (knee, back, shoulder)
- Abdominal surgeries
- Cardiac surgeries
- Any VA surgery or surgery for service-connected condition

### Training Injury Scars
- Obstacle course injuries
- Vehicle accidents
- Falls
- Combatives injuries

### Skin Condition Scars
- Scarring from service-connected skin conditions
- Burn pit exposure effects
- Chemical exposure scarring

## Proving Service Connection

### For Scars from Service Injuries

**Evidence needed:**
1. Current scar examination
2. Documentation of in-service injury that caused scar
3. (Usually obvious nexus—scar exists and injury documented)

**In-service documentation:**
- Line of duty determinations
- Medical records of injury
- Surgical records
- Purple Heart citation
- Buddy statements

### For Surgical Scars

If you had surgery for a service-connected condition:
1. The condition is already service-connected
2. Surgery was for that condition
3. Scar results from surgery
4. File claim for surgical scar as secondary

**Example**: Service-connected for knee condition → had knee surgery → have surgical scar → claim scar secondary to knee condition

### For Scars Not Previously Claimed

Many veterans have scars from service they never thought to claim:
- Old training injuries
- Minor combat wounds
- Surgeries during service

If you can document the in-service origin, you can still claim these scars.

## C&P Exam for Scars

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. **Photograph all scars** (required)
2. **Measure dimensions** (length, width)
3. **Assess characteristics:**
   - Texture
   - Color (hypo/hyperpigmented)
   - Adherence to underlying tissue
   - Surface contour
   - Tissue loss
4. **Test for pain** on palpation
5. **Check for instability**
6. **Assess functional limitation**

### How to Prepare

**Identify all your scars:**
Make a list of every scar from military service, including location and cause.

**Know which are painful:**
Before the exam, note which scars hurt when touched or with certain movements.

**Document functional limitations:**
If any scar limits your movement, be ready to explain and demonstrate.

### During the Exam

**Don't minimize:**
- If a scar is painful, say so
- If it's sensitive to touch, demonstrate
- If it limits movement, show the examiner

**Mention all scars:**
Don't assume the examiner will find them all. Point out every service-connected scar.

**Describe functional impact:**
- "This scar on my forearm pulls when I extend my arm fully"
- "This knee scar hurts when I bend down"
- "This facial scar causes numbness in that area"

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Photographs of scars** (you can provide your own)
2. **Medical records** documenting original injury
3. **Surgical records** if applicable
4. **Dermatologist evaluation** if available
5. **Measurements** (length, width, area)

### Service Records

6. **Line of duty determination**
7. **Incident reports**
8. **Medical records from service**
9. **Awards documentation** (Purple Heart)

### Lay Evidence

10. **Personal statement** describing:
    - How scar was acquired
    - Current symptoms (pain, sensitivity)
    - Functional limitations
    - Impact on daily life

11. **Buddy statements** from:
    - Witnesses to original injury
    - Family members describing scar characteristics

## Secondary Conditions from Scars

### Nerve Damage
- Scars can damage underlying nerves
- Causes numbness, tingling, or pain
- Rated separately under neurological codes

### Limitation of Motion
- Scar tissue can restrict joint movement
- Rated under musculoskeletal codes

### Mental Health
- Disfiguring scars, especially facial, can cause:
  - Depression
  - Anxiety
  - Social avoidance
- Rated under mental health codes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Claiming Surgical Scars
If you had surgery for a service-connected condition, claim the scar. It's almost automatic service connection.

### 2. Forgetting About Painful Scars
Even small scars that are painful qualify for 10%. Don't overlook this.

### 3. Not Mentioning All Scars
Make sure every service-connected scar is evaluated. The examiner may not find them all.

### 4. Minimizing at the Exam
If it hurts when they touch it, say so. Don't tough it out.

### 5. Not Claiming Functional Limitation
If a scar limits movement, it should be rated under the body part code, potentially resulting in a higher rating.

## Maximizing Your Scar Rating

### Get Measurements
Before your C&P exam, measure your scars:
- Length in inches/cm
- Width at widest point
- Calculate area if large

### Document Pain
Keep a journal of:
- When scars hurt
- What triggers pain
- Impact on activities

### Photograph Your Scars
Take clear photos showing:
- Size comparison (with ruler)
- Texture and color
- Any tissue loss or deformity

### Consider Mental Health Impact
If disfiguring scars affect your mental health, document this and potentially file secondary mental health claim.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get VA disability for a small scar?
Yes, if it's painful, unstable, or causes functional limitation. Size matters for some ratings but not for painful/unstable scar ratings.

### Are surgical scars from VA surgery compensable?
Yes. If the surgery was for a service-connected condition, the resulting scar is secondary to that condition.

### Can I claim scars from before service?
Only if they were aggravated (made worse) by service. Pre-existing scars that didn't change aren't compensable.

### What if my scar has faded over time?
You can still claim it if it meets current rating criteria. Faded scars may still be painful or have texture/contour issues.

### Can I get separate ratings for multiple scars?
Yes. Each distinct scar can be evaluated separately, and painful/unstable scars are counted together under DC 7804.

### Do I need to claim each scar separately?
You should list all scars in your claim, but the VA will group them appropriately by diagnostic code.
