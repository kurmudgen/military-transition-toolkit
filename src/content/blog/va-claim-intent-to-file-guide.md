# VA Intent to File: Lock In Your Effective Date (Complete Guide)

## Bottom Line Up Front

An **Intent to File (ITF)** is a one-minute action that can be worth **thousands of dollars**. It locks in your effective date up to one year before you submit your actual claim. If approved, you receive backpay to your ITF date instead of your claim submission date. Example: You file an ITF on January 1, submit your claim June 1, get approved in October. You get backpay to January 1—six extra months of compensation. **File your ITF immediately. There's no downside.**

## What Is an Intent to File?

An Intent to File is a formal notice to the VA that you intend to file a disability claim. It:

- **Reserves your effective date** for up to one year
- **Takes less than 5 minutes** to submit
- **Costs nothing**
- **Has no penalty** if you don't follow through
- **Protects your backpay** while you gather evidence

Think of it as placing a placeholder. You're telling the VA: "I'm planning to file a claim. Hold this date for me."

## Why Intent to File Matters (The Money)

The effective date determines when your compensation starts. Without an ITF, your effective date is the day you submit your complete claim.

**Without Intent to File:**
- You submit your claim on June 15
- Your effective date is June 15
- You get compensation from June 15 forward

**With Intent to File:**
- You submit ITF on January 15
- You gather evidence for 5 months
- You submit your claim on June 15
- Your claim is approved
- Your effective date is **January 15** (the ITF date)
- You receive 5 months of backpay

**Example calculation:**

You're approved for 50% disability ($1,075/month).

Without ITF: Effective date June 15. Compensation starts June 15.

With ITF: Effective date January 15. You receive **$5,375 in backpay** (5 months × $1,075).

That's $5,375 for a 5-minute form.

## How to File an Intent to File

### Method 1: VA.gov (Fastest)

1. Go to [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)
2. Sign in with Login.gov, ID.me, or DS Logon
3. Click "File a claim for compensation"
4. Look for "Start your Intent to File" option
5. Select the benefit type (disability compensation)
6. Submit

**Done.** You'll receive a confirmation with your ITF date.

### Method 2: Call the VA

1. Call **1-800-827-1000**
2. Tell the representative you want to submit an Intent to File for disability compensation
3. They'll record it in the system
4. Ask for confirmation number and date

### Method 3: In Person

1. Visit your local VA Regional Office
2. Request to file an Intent to File
3. Get documentation of your ITF date

### Method 4: Through a VSO

1. Contact a Veterans Service Organization (DAV, VFW, American Legion)
2. Ask them to submit an Intent to File on your behalf
3. Confirm the submission date

## What Happens After You File

1. **Your effective date is locked** for one year from the ITF date
2. **You have 12 months** to submit your complete claim
3. **If you don't submit within 12 months**, the ITF expires (no penalty, you just lose that date)
4. **If your claim is approved**, your effective date is the ITF date
5. **You receive backpay** from the ITF date to the approval date

## Intent to File Rules

### One-Year Window

Your ITF is valid for 12 months. If you don't submit your claim within that window, you'll need to file a new ITF.

**Example:**
- ITF filed: January 1, 2025
- Deadline to submit claim: January 1, 2026
- If you submit December 15, 2025: ITF is valid
- If you submit January 15, 2026: ITF has expired, new effective date is January 15, 2026

### Multiple Claims Under One ITF

One ITF covers all conditions you claim within that year. You don't need a separate ITF for each condition.

**Example:**
- ITF filed January 1
- Claim 1 submitted March 1: Back pain
- Claim 2 submitted July 1: PTSD
- Claim 3 submitted November 1: Sleep apnea (secondary)

All three claims have an effective date of January 1 (the ITF date).

### ITF Doesn't Guarantee Anything

The ITF only locks your effective date. It doesn't:
- Guarantee your claim will be approved
- Start any benefits
- Obligate you to file

If your claim is denied, the ITF doesn't matter. But if approved, it's worth potentially thousands in backpay.

## Common Questions

### Should I file an ITF even if I'm not ready to claim?

**Yes.** There's no downside. File the ITF now, take up to a year to gather evidence and submit your claim.

### What if I file multiple ITFs?

Only the earliest valid ITF matters. Filing additional ITFs doesn't help or hurt.

### Can I file an ITF for a condition I'm not sure about?

Yes. The ITF doesn't specify conditions. It just says "I intend to file a disability claim." You decide which conditions to claim when you submit the actual claim.

### What if I'm already service-connected and want to file for increase?

File an ITF anyway. It protects your effective date for the increase claim.

### Does my ITF extend for appeals?

No. An ITF is for new claims, not appeals. Appeals have their own effective date rules.

### What if I separate from service soon?

If you file within one year of separation, your effective date can be the day after separation—regardless of ITF. But file an ITF anyway as backup.

## Intent to File Strategy

### Best Practice: File Now

If you're even considering a VA claim, file an Intent to File today. Right now. It takes 5 minutes and costs nothing.

Why?
- You may not get to your claim for months
- Life happens—medical appointments, gathering records, job hunting
- Every month you delay without an ITF is lost backpay

### New Claims

1. File ITF immediately
2. Gather evidence (medical records, nexus letters, buddy statements)
3. Prepare for C&P exam
4. Submit claim before ITF expires (12 months)

### Increase Claims

1. File ITF immediately
2. Document worsening condition
3. Get updated medical evidence
4. Submit increase claim before ITF expires

### Secondary Claims

1. File ITF immediately
2. Research secondary condition connections
3. Get nexus letter if needed
4. Submit secondary claim before ITF expires

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Filing an ITF

The biggest mistake. There's no reason not to file. Do it now.

### Mistake 2: Waiting Too Long to Submit Claim

You have one year. Don't wait until month 13. Track your ITF date and submit before it expires.

### Mistake 3: Thinking ITF Starts Your Claim

The ITF just reserves your date. You still need to submit a complete claim with evidence.

### Mistake 4: Not Documenting Your ITF

Keep a record of your ITF submission date and confirmation number. You may need to prove when you filed.

### Mistake 5: Filing ITF After Submitting Claim

An ITF filed after your claim is submitted doesn't help. The effective date is already set by the claim submission.

## Step-by-Step: File Your ITF Right Now

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. **Go to VA.gov**
3. **Sign in** (create an account if needed)
4. **Navigate to disability claims**
5. **Submit Intent to File**
6. **Screenshot your confirmation**
7. **Note the date in your calendar** (set a reminder for 10-11 months out)

That's it. You've just potentially saved yourself months of backpay.

## ITF and BDD Claims

**Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)** claims are filed 180-90 days before separation. If you're doing a BDD claim, you don't need a separate ITF—the BDD claim itself establishes your effective date as the day after discharge.

However, if you're outside the BDD window or miss it, file an ITF immediately.

## Real-World Impact

**Veteran A:** Files claim on June 1. No ITF. Approved October 1 for 70% ($1,716/month). Effective date: June 1. No backpay owed.

**Veteran B:** Files ITF on January 1. Files claim on June 1. Approved October 1 for 70% ($1,716/month). Effective date: January 1. Receives **$8,580 in backpay** (5 months).

Same condition. Same rating. Same approval date. $8,580 difference.

The only difference? Five minutes to file an Intent to File.

## Summary

| Factor | Without ITF | With ITF |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Effective date | Claim submission date | ITF date (up to 1 year earlier) |
| Backpay potential | None | Up to 12 months |
| Time to file | N/A | 5 minutes |
| Cost | N/A | Free |
| Risk | N/A | None |

**File your Intent to File now.** There is no reason not to.
