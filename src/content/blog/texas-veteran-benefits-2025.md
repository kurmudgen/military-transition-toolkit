# Texas Veteran Benefits 2025: Complete Guide to Living Tax-Free in Texas

## Bottom Line Up Front

Texas has some of the best veteran benefits in the nation. **No state income tax** for anyone. **100% property tax exemption** if you're 100% disabled through the VA. **150 hours of free college tuition** through the Hazelwood Act. Plus veteran hiring preferences, drivers license exemptions, business advantages, and more. If you're choosing where to retire or relocate after service, Texas makes a strong financial case. This guide covers every major benefit, who qualifies, and how to maximize your value.

## Why Texas for veterans?

1.5 million veterans live in Texas. That's not an accident.

Texas has:
- No state income tax (you keep more of your retirement/disability pay)
- Massive property tax breaks for disabled veterans
- Free college tuition for veterans and dependents
- 15+ major military installations (easy transition, familiar culture)
- Strong veteran employment programs
- Large veteran community and support networks
- Booming economy with job opportunities

Let's break down each benefit and what it's actually worth.

## Property tax exemption (the big one)

This is the benefit that changes the math on living in Texas.

### 100% Disabled Veterans (the full exemption)

If you have a **100% VA disability rating**, you qualify for:
- **100% exemption** from school district property taxes
- **100% exemption** from county property taxes
- **100% exemption** from city property taxes (most cities)
- **$12,000 exemption** from other taxing entities

**What's this worth?**

Average home in Texas: $320,000
Average property tax rate: 1.6% (varies by area)
Annual property tax without exemption: ~$5,120

**With 100% disability exemption: $0 for most homeowners**

That's $5,000+ per year in savings. Every year. For life.

Over 20 years of retirement, that's **$100,000+ in tax-free value.**

### Partial exemptions (if you're not 100%)

Don't have 100%? You still get partial exemptions:

- **10-29% disabled:** $5,000 off assessed home value
- **30-49% disabled:** $7,500 off assessed home value
- **50-69% disabled:** $10,000 off assessed home value
- **70-99% disabled:** $12,000 off assessed home value

Plus an additional $12,000 off for disabled veterans who are 65+ or surviving spouses.

**Example:**
60% disabled veteran with a $300,000 home in an area with 2% tax rate:
- Regular tax: $6,000/year
- With exemption: $5,800/year
- Savings: $200/year

Not as dramatic as 100%, but it adds up.

### How to claim it

1. **Get your VA disability rating** (if you don't have one, apply through VA)

2. **Apply with your county appraisal district** - each county handles this separately. Search "[your county] appraisal district veteran exemption"

3. **Provide documentation:**
   - Copy of your VA disability award letter showing percentage
   - DD-214 showing honorable discharge
   - Texas driver's license or ID showing residency
   - Proof of homeownership

4. **Apply by April 30th** for that tax year (but you can apply late and still get future years)

5. **It carries forward** - once approved, you don't reapply annually unless your situation changes

**Where to start:**
- [Travis County](https://www.traviscad.org/) (Austin area)
- [Harris County](https://hcad.org/) (Houston area)
- [Bexar County](https://www.bcad.org/) (San Antonio area)
- [Dallas County](https://www.dallascad.org/) (Dallas area)
- [Tarrant County](https://www.tad.org/) (Fort Worth area)

Or Google "[your county] appraisal district"

## No state income tax (everyone benefits)

Texas has no state income tax. Period.

**What's this worth?**

If you're pulling in military retirement, disability, and civilian income:
- **E-7 retirement + 60% disability + $75K civilian job** = ~$140K total income
- In California (9.3% state tax on that): **~$13,000/year in state taxes**
- In Texas: **$0**

That's $13,000 more in your pocket. Every year.

Over 20 years: **$260,000+** (assuming no income growth, which is conservative)

This alone makes Texas attractive for military retirees drawing multiple income streams.

## Hazelwood Act (free college tuition)

The Hazelwood Act provides **up to 150 semester credit hours of tuition exemption** at Texas public colleges and universities.

### Who qualifies?

You must be a Texas resident and meet one of these:

- Veteran who served at least 181 days of active duty (excluding training)
- Veteran with an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions
- Served as a member of the Texas National Guard or Reserve
- Child of veteran (if veteran qualifies and transfers unused hours)

### What's covered?

- **Tuition and required fees** at any Texas public college or university
- **Up to 150 credit hours** (enough for a bachelor's degree + some graduate work, or multiple degrees)
- **Undergraduate and graduate courses**

### What's NOT covered?

- Books, supplies, room and board
- Lab fees (usually covered, but varies)
- Optional fees
- Private universities

### What's this worth?

**University of Texas at Austin:**
- Annual tuition: ~$11,500
- Four-year degree: ~$46,000
- **Hazelwood saves you: $46,000**

**Texas A&M:**
- Annual tuition: ~$12,000
- Four-year degree: ~$48,000
- **Hazelwood saves you: $48,000**

**Community college pathway:**
- 2 years community college: ~$8,000
- 2 years university: ~$24,000
- **Total saved: $32,000**

If you have kids, you can **transfer your unused hours to them**. Many veterans use 30-45 hours for themselves and give the rest to their kids.

### How to apply

1. **Apply for admission** to a Texas public college/university
2. **Complete the Hazelwood application** through the school's financial aid office
3. **Provide documentation:**
   - DD-214 showing honorable discharge
   - Proof of Texas residency (driver's license, utility bills)
   - If transferring to children: birth certificate and veteran's unused hours

4. **Submit BEFORE registration** for each semester

Each school handles it differently. Contact their financial aid office.

**Important:** You must be a Texas resident when you apply, not when you served. So you can move to Texas after service and still qualify.

## Comparing Texas to other veteran-friendly states

**Texas vs. Florida:**
Both have no state income tax. Florida has property tax exemptions for disabled veterans but more limited (not as generous as Texas 100% exemption). Florida has no Hazelwood-equivalent for free college. Edge: Texas

**Texas vs. Oklahoma:**
Oklahoma has lower property taxes overall and veteran property tax exemptions. Oklahoma has some veteran education benefits. But Oklahoma has state income tax (up to 4.75%). Edge: Texas for high earners

**Texas vs. South Dakota:**
South Dakota has no state income tax, lower property taxes, and veteran property tax breaks. Education benefits are limited. Cost of living is lower, but so are job opportunities. Edge: Texas for job market, South Dakota for pure tax minimization

**Texas vs. Arizona:**
Arizona has property tax exemptions for disabled veterans and no tax on military retirement. But Arizona has state income tax on other income. Education benefits are more limited than Texas. Edge: Texas overall

## Real cost comparison (retired E-8 example)

**Scenario:** Retired E-8 with 23 years, 100% VA disability, married, 2 kids, working $90K civilian job

**Income:**
- Military retirement: $38,000/year
- VA disability: $44,000/year (100%, with dependents)
- Civilian job: $90,000/year
- **Total: $172,000/year**

**Living in California:**
- State income tax: ~$14,000/year (military retirement tax-free in CA, but disability and civilian taxed)
- Property tax on $500K home: ~$7,500/year
- **Total state/local taxes: $21,500/year**

**Living in Texas:**
- State income tax: $0
- Property tax on $400K home with 100% exemption: $0
- **Total state/local taxes: $0/year**

**Difference: $21,500/year savings in Texas**

Over 20 years of retirement: **$430,000+ savings** (not accounting for investment growth of that money)

Plus Hazelwood Act for 2 kids: ~$100,000 in tuition savings

**Total Texas advantage for this family: $500,000+ over 20 years**

That's real money.

## Who should consider Texas?

**Strong fit if you:**
- Have 100% VA disability (property tax exemption is massive)
- Have kids who'll attend college (Hazelwood Act)
- Want no state income tax
- Work in energy, defense, tech, logistics, or manufacturing
- Like hot weather and sprawling suburbs
- Want strong veteran community and support

**Maybe not the best fit if you:**
- Hate heat (summers are brutal, 100°F+ common)
- Want mountains or dramatic nature (Texas is flat outside Hill Country)
- Prefer walkable cities (most of Texas is car-dependent)
- Want strong public transit (basically doesn't exist)
- Work in industries not strong in Texas

## The bottom line

Texas offers veterans an extremely attractive financial package:
- No state income tax saves most retirees $5K-$15K+/year
- 100% property tax exemption saves $3K-$8K+/year for disabled veterans
- Hazelwood Act saves $30K-$50K per family member for college
- Low cost of living in most areas
- Strong job market
- Large veteran community

**For a 100% disabled veteran with a family, moving to Texas can be worth $500K+ over retirement.**

Even if you're not 100%, the no income tax benefit alone makes Texas financially competitive with most states.

Is it perfect? No. It's hot. It's sprawling. Public services are sometimes limited. But financially, for most veterans, it's hard to beat.
