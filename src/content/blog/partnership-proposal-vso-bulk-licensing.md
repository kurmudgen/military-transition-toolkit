## Current Situation & Challenges

### Transition Landscape

**The Data:**
- 200,000 service members transition annually
- Only 15% feel TAP adequately prepared them for civilian employment
- 43% of veterans leave their first civilian job within one year
- 60%+ of veterans are underemployed relative to their skills and experience
- 40-75% describe their military transition as difficult or very difficult

### VSO Service Gaps

Your organization provides invaluable support through:
- VA benefits claims assistance
- Peer-to-peer support and counseling
- Advocacy at local, state, and national levels
- Community and camaraderie for veterans

**However, gaps exist:**
- **Limited career counseling capacity:** Staff cannot provide personalized career guidance to every transitioning member
- **Scalability challenges:** One-on-one counseling doesn't scale to thousands of members
- **24/7 availability:** Members need support beyond office hours
- **Rating/MOS-specific guidance:** Impossible to provide individualized guidance for every military background in traditional counseling

**Impact:** Members seek career transition support from multiple sources, diminishing the VSO's value proposition and potentially losing members to organizations offering more comprehensive services.
