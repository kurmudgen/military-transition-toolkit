# GSA Schedule Contracts for Veteran Businesses: Complete Guide

A GSA Schedule contract is like a government "approved vendor" list. Once you're on it, federal agencies can buy from you easily without going through the full competitive bidding process. For veteran-owned businesses, a GSA Schedule can be a powerful tool for winning government contracts.

This guide explains what GSA Schedules are, how veteran businesses can obtain them, and how to use them successfully.

## What is a GSA Schedule?

### Basic Concept

**GSA Schedule (Multiple Award Schedule - MAS):**
- Pre-negotiated contracts with GSA
- Fixed pricing for products/services
- Agencies can buy directly
- Streamlined procurement
- 20-year contract term (5-year base plus options)

### How It Works

**For government buyers:**
1. Need a product or service
2. Check if it's on GSA Schedule
3. Get quotes from Schedule holders
4. Place order without full competition

**For Schedule holders:**
- Pre-approved vendor
- Set pricing
- Access to all federal agencies
- Streamlined ordering process

### Why It Matters

**Benefits:**
- Easier for agencies to buy from you
- Removes procurement barriers
- Access to entire federal market
- Credibility with government buyers
- Required for some opportunities
