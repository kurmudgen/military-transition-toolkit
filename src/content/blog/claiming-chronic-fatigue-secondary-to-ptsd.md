## Bottom Line Up Front

**Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or chronic fatigue can be claimed secondary to PTSD** with medical documentation showing PTSD causes exhaustion through sleep disruption, hyperarousal, and stress hormone dysregulation. VA recognizes the well-established relationship between combat trauma and debilitating fatigue. Claims require medical documentation of fatigue meeting diagnostic criteria (persistent ≥6 months, causing functional impairment) and clear nexus showing PTSD-related causation. Typical ratings: 10-30%; processing time 90-120 days. Success rate 65-75% with proper documentation.

## Medical Basis: How PTSD Causes Chronic Fatigue

PTSD produces chronic exhaustion through multiple physiological mechanisms:

### Sleep Disruption and Sleep Debt
PTSD severely disrupts sleep architecture:
- **Nightmare-related awakenings** prevent REM sleep accumulation (where most restoration occurs)
- **Sleep onset insomnia** reduces total sleep hours
- **Non-restorative sleep** even when achieving hours (fragmented, shallow sleep)
- **Sleep fragmentation** prevents deep slow-wave sleep needed for physical/cognitive restoration
- Chronic sleep debt creates persistent fatigue regardless of time in bed

### Hyperarousal Exhaustion
Constant sympathetic nervous system activation is metabolically exhausting:
- **Continuous cortisol elevation** metabolically taxing (like constant marathon running)
- **Adrenaline release cycles** throughout day and night deplete energy reserves
- **Vigilant threat-scanning** is mentally exhausting even when no actual threats
- **Muscle tension from hypervigilance** creates physical fatigue
- Baseline metabolic rate elevated; veterans "running at 100% effort" all day

### Inflammatory Cascade
PTSD creates chronic inflammation:
- **Elevated inflammatory cytokines** (IL-6, TNF-alpha, CRP) cause fatigue directly
- **Microglial activation** (brain inflammation) produces brain fog and fatigue
- **HPA axis dysregulation** increases inflammatory markers
- Research shows combat veterans with PTSD have biomarkers matching myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS)

### Cognitive Load and Dissociation
Mental effort of managing trauma symptoms creates exhaustion:
- **Intrusive thoughts and flashbacks** demand constant mental processing
- **Emotional regulation efforts** deplete cognitive resources
- **Dissociation** (trauma response) creates disconnection and fatigue
- **Memory processing** of fragmented trauma memories is cognitively exhausting

### Medication Effects
PTSD medications can cause fatigue:
- **SSRIs/SNRIs** often produce fatigue as side effect
- **Atypical antipsychotics** (used for PTSD aggression/nightmares) frequently cause fatigue
- **Prazosin** (PTSD nightmare medication) produces sedation in some patients
- Paradoxically: PTSD medications may be necessary for any sleep, though they cause secondary fatigue

## Eligibility Criteria for Secondary Chronic Fatigue Claim

### Primary Requirements

**1. Service-Connected PTSD**
- PTSD established service-connected condition
- Documented diagnosis in VA records
- Ongoing treatment or documented PTSD history

**2. Chronic Fatigue Diagnosis**
- Medical documentation of chronic fatigue or CFS diagnosis
- Diagnosed by licensed medical professional (typically internist or rheumatologist)
- Fatigue persistent ≥6 months (CFS diagnostic criterion)

## Evidence Requirements and Documentation

### Medical Records to Gather

**From VA:**
- PTSD treatment records showing symptom severity
- Sleep study results (if completed)
- Rheumatology records (if referred for CFS evaluation)
- Primary care notes documenting fatigue complaints
- Lab work (CBC, metabolic panel, inflammatory markers if available)
- Mental health notes documenting sleep issues, hyperarousal

**From Private Providers:**
- Internist/general practitioner documentation of chronic fatigue diagnosis
- Rheumatologist CFS evaluation (if referred)
- Sleep specialist records and sleep study results if completed
- Lab work: CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid function (ruling out other causes), inflammatory markers
- Medical notes specifically documenting fatigue severity and onset timing

**Supporting Documentation:**
- Detailed timeline: when PTSD diagnosed, when fatigue began, relationship between them
- Personal fatigue journal (2-4 weeks): daily energy levels, activities impaired by fatigue, sleep patterns
- Work-related documentation: absences due to fatigue, accommodation requests, performance impact
- Family statement: describes severity of fatigue, impact on activities
- Daily activity documentation: specific examples of fatigue impact ("cannot walk more than [X] distance," "works from bed due to exhaustion")

### Medical Evidence Standards VA Evaluates

**Chronic Fatigue/CFS Diagnosis**
- Explicit diagnosis: chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue
- Diagnostic criteria met: fatigue persistent ≥6 months, causes post-exertional malaise (worsening after activity), affects multiple body systems
- Duration: documented complaints for minimum 6-12 months
- Exclusion of other causes: medical records rule out thyroid disease, anemia, depression (without PTSD), sleep apnea, other conditions

**Functional Impairment**
- Specific documentation of how fatigue impairs functioning: work inability, activity restriction, daily impact
- Comparison: pre-fatigue functioning vs. current functioning
- Concrete examples: "Previously worked full-time, now unable to work more than 2 hours without exhaustion"

**Sleep Disruption Correlation**
- Sleep study results showing abnormal sleep (fragmented, reduced REM, reduced slow-wave sleep)
- Medical notes documenting sleep disruption as PTSD symptom and fatigue cause
- If no sleep study, detailed documentation of sleep pattern (hours slept, quality, nightmares)

**Medical Workup**
- Labs ruling out medical causes: thyroid, complete blood count, metabolic panel, B12/folate (if applicable)
- If inflammatory markers obtained: elevated cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, CRP)
- Imaging if completed: rules out other conditions

## Nexus Letter Requirements

### Essential Nexus Components

**Provider Credentials**
- Licensed MD or DO experienced with PTSD and chronic fatigue
- Preferably: internist, rheumatologist, or sleep medicine specialist
- Statement: "I have evaluated and/or treated [Veteran] for chronic fatigue and service-connected PTSD"

**Specific Nexus Language**

**Strong Statements:**
- "With reasonable medical certainty, [Veteran]'s chronic fatigue syndrome is directly caused by service-connected PTSD through multiple physiological mechanisms: sleep disruption, inflammatory cascade, and stress hormone dysregulation"
- "[Veteran]'s fatigue began coincident with PTSD diagnosis and correlates with PTSD symptom severity. When PTSD symptoms improve, fatigue improves; when PTSD worsens, fatigue intensifies"
- "The chronic fatigue meets diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis. Research demonstrates PTSD patients develop biomarkers and symptom patterns identical to ME/CFS. [Veteran]'s condition represents PTSD-induced CFS variant"

**Physiological Pathways**

**Sleep Disruption Pathway:**
"[Veteran]'s PTSD-related sleep disruption (documented nightmares X nights weekly, sleep onset insomnia, fragmented sleep) prevents adequate REM and slow-wave sleep. Chronic sleep debt produces the persistent, unrefreshing fatigue characteristic of CFS. [Veteran]'s sleep study showed [specific abnormalities], consistent with trauma-induced sleep architecture disruption."

**Inflammatory Pathway:**
"PTSD dysregulates the immune system, producing chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, CRP). [Veteran]'s inflammatory markers show [specific elevations]. This immune dysregulation produces myalgic encephalomyelitis symptoms: post-exertional malaise, persistent exhaustion, cognitive impairment ("brain fog"). These are medical consequences of PTSD-driven inflammation, not psychological fatigue."

**Metabolic Exhaustion Pathway:**
"PTSD-related sympathetic nervous system hyperactivation maintains elevated metabolic rate and continuous stress hormone elevation. [Veteran] operates in chronic 'fight or flight' state, metabolically equivalent to continuous physical exertion. This sustained activation depletes energy reserves, creating persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep (if sleep were adequate). The fatigue is physiological exhaustion from PTSD-driven metabolic dysregulation."

**Statement of Basis:**
"This opinion is based on [X years] clinical experience with PTSD and chronic fatigue, direct evaluation of [Veteran], review of medical records including [sleep study/lab work], and medical literature documenting PTSD as cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis in combat populations."

## VA Rating for Chronic Fatigue

### Rating Schedule

VA rates fatigue/CFS under Schedule for Musculoskeletal Conditions or Neurological Conditions:

**10% Rating**
- Fatigue limits moderate exertion but doesn't prevent work
- Occasional rest periods needed during activities
- Minimal functional impairment in employment
- Example: Can work full-time with regular breaks, but cannot do physically demanding work

**20% Rating**
- Significant fatigue limiting activities
- Unable to sustain heavy work; limited to sedentary/light work
- Post-exertional malaise documented (worsening after activity)
- Example: Cannot work more than 4-6 hours daily, requires significant rest

**30% Rating**
- Severe fatigue causing substantial work limitation
- Unable to sustain regular employment
- Severe post-exertional malaise (significant worsening after minimal exertion)
- Example: Can work only 2-3 hours daily despite medication, housebound most days

**40% Rating**
- Disabling fatigue preventing regular employment
- Primarily housebound due to severe fatigue
- Minimal activity toleration
- Rare rating; typically requires Total Disability Individual Unemployability claim

### Combined Rating Example

**60% PTSD + 20% Chronic Fatigue = 68%**
- Start with 60%
- Calculate: (100% - 60%) × 20% = 8%
- Combined: 60% + 8% = 68%

### Monthly Compensation (2025 Rates)
- 10%: ~$197/month
- 20%: ~$396/month
- 30%: ~$614/month
- 40%: ~$813/month

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Assuming Fatigue Alone Is Ratable
**Mistake:** Filing for "fatigue" without diagnosis meeting CFS or medical criteria.

**Fix:** Obtain formal chronic fatigue or myalgic encephalomyelitis diagnosis from medical provider. Vague "tiredness" doesn't meet diagnostic criteria.

### 2. Missing Sleep Study Documentation
**Mistake:** Filing with fatigue diagnosis but no sleep study showing sleep disruption cause.

**Fix:** Request VA sleep study to objectively document sleep architecture abnormalities. Greatly strengthens PTSD-fatigue nexus.

### 3. Weak Functional Documentation
**Mistake:** Not documenting how fatigue specifically impairs daily functioning and work.

**Fix:** Provide concrete examples: "Cannot work more than 3 hours without exhaustion," "Post-exertional malaise prevents normal activities for 1-2 days after minimal exertion."

### 4. Inadequate Medical Workup
**Mistake:** Not ruling out other causes of fatigue (thyroid disease, anemia, sleep apnea, depression).

**Fix:** Include lab work (TSH, CBC, B12) and sleep study results showing other causes ruled out.

### 5. No PTSD-Fatigue Timeline
**Mistake:** Not documenting when fatigue began relative to PTSD/trauma.

**Fix:** Create detailed timeline: trauma date → PTSD diagnosis → fatigue onset. Show temporal relationship.

### 6. Vague Nexus Letters
**Mistake:** Provider letter stating "fatigue could be from PTSD" without specific physiological mechanism.

**Fix:** Require detailed explanation of how PTSD causes fatigue (sleep disruption, inflammatory response, metabolic effects).

## FAQ

### Q: Will VA accept CFS diagnosis if I also have depression?
**A:** Yes. PTSD-related depression doesn't eliminate CFS claim. File for both; separate ratings apply if both documented.

### Q: Does my fatigue have to be "severe" for disability rating?
**A:** No. 10% rating possible for mild fatigue with documented functional limitation. However, higher ratings require more significant impairment.

### Q: Can I file for CFS if I didn't have sleep study?
**A:** Yes, but sleep study significantly strengthens claim. If not completed, request VA sleep medicine referral as part of claim.

### Q: What if fatigue improved after treatment?
**A:** Improvement actually strengthens claim by showing PTSD-fatigue connection. Document improvement; doesn't reduce rating if fatigue remains despite improvement.

## Final Recommendation

Chronic fatigue secondary to PTSD is approvable with proper medical documentation of CFS diagnosis and clear PTSD-causation nexus. Sleep disruption documentation (preferably sleep study) significantly strengthens these claims.

**Next Steps:** Request VA sleep study; obtain chronic fatigue diagnosis; file claim with strong PTSD-fatigue nexus evidence.
