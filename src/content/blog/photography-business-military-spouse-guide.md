# Photography Business for Military Spouses: On-Base Clients Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Photography offers military spouses **$30,000-$100,000+ annual income** with built-in clients at every duty station—military families constantly need photos of milestones, homecomings, and deployments. You can start with **$2,000-$5,000** in equipment and begin earning within **2-4 weeks**. While the business isn't fully location-independent, your skills transfer perfectly, and military installations provide consistent demand. Most photographers rebuild clientele within 2-3 months at each new duty station.

## Success Stories

**Ashley, Marine Corps Spouse - Homecoming Specialist**
"I started photographing homecomings because I understood how much those moments mean. Now I'm the go-to homecoming photographer at three units on base. When ships come in, I photograph 10-15 families at $350 each. One homecoming day can mean $4,000-$5,000. When we PCS'd, I connected with the FRG at our new duty station immediately. Within two months, I was booked again."

**Marcus, Air Force Spouse - Newborn Photography**
"I set up a small home studio for newborn photography—portable lights, backdrops that pack flat. Every base has babies. I book 3-4 newborn sessions per week at $400 each. When we moved from Florida to Alaska, I was scared no one would book during winter. Turns out, people want photos regardless of weather. I shoot indoors anyway."

**Priya, Army Spouse - Mini Session Empire**
"I do 'mini session events' every month—holiday themes, spring flowers, fall colors. Book 15-20 families at $125 each for 15-minute sessions. That's $1,800-$2,500 in one afternoon. I've now done minis at four different installations. The formula works everywhere. I just scout new locations when we PCS."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "Photography is too expensive to start"
**Solution:** Start with entry-level camera and kit lens ($500-$800). A Canon Rebel or Sony a6000 takes professional images. Upgrade as you earn. Many successful photographers started with used equipment.

### "The market is saturated"
**Reality:** Yes, there are many photographers. But most are mediocre, inconsistent, or don't understand military families. Excellence and reliability stand out. Military-specific expertise is rare and valued.

### "I don't know anyone here yet"
**Solution:** Start on social media before you arrive. Join installation Facebook groups. Offer "I'm new here" mini sessions. Military spouses love supporting fellow spouses—lean into community.

### "What about OCONUS?"
**Solution:** Photography works overseas too—often with less competition. Permits and regulations may differ. Research before arrival. Some OCONUS locations (Germany, Japan) have active photographer communities.

### "I can't rebuild every 2-3 years"
**Solution:** Systems travel even when clients don't. Your processes, pricing, marketing templates, and skills get better each time. Most photographers rebuild faster with each PCS. Supplement with portable income (editing, presets, education).

- **Week 7-8:** Deliver galleries. Collect testimonials. Refine workflow.

### Days 61-90: Growth
