## Summary

**Military.com is the 800-pound gorilla** of veteran job search with massive traffic, brand recognition, and a huge job database. Their strengths are **scale, SEO, and content volume**. Their weaknesses are **generic experience, ad overload, no community, and missing critical transition tools** like VA claims and state benefits.

**MTT's opportunity:** **Can't beat them at job search volume**, but can win on **quality, personalization, and comprehensive transition support**. Position MTT as **"the transition platform for veterans who want more than just job listings"** - community, claims, benefits, coaching, and a personalized journey.

**Key insight:** Military.com users are **active job seekers** who will also need VA claims help, benefits comparison, and community support. MTT should **partner or integrate with job boards** (including Military.com's Monster feed) rather than trying to compete head-on, and **differentiate on the tools they don't have**.

**Strategic move:** Acknowledge Military.com's dominance in job search, integrate their job feed, and **position MTT as the comprehensive transition platform** that includes but exceeds job search. "Come for the jobs (via Military.com integration), stay for the VA claims, community, and personalized support."
