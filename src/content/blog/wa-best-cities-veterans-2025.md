## Bottom Line Up Front

**Spokane offers the best overall value** for Washington veterans in 2025: median home price of $370,000-390,000 (lowest among major cities), average rent of $1,156/month, full-service VA medical center, solid employment opportunities, and low cost of living (28% below state average). **Tacoma is the sweet spot** for JBLM-area veterans: median home price $499,000, rent $1,487/month, excellent VA healthcare access at American Lake, strong veteran community, and growing job market at only 10% below Seattle's cost. **Seattle offers the highest salaries** ($90,000-140,000 in tech) but brutal housing costs (median $856,000-980,000, rent $1,945-3,850/month) that eat those gains unless you're 100% disabled and qualify for maximum property tax exemptions.

**Quick city rankings (1-10, best to worst for overall veteran value):**
1. **Spokane** - Best affordability, full VA medical center, decent jobs
2. **Tacoma** - JBLM proximity, excellent VA access, mid-range costs
3. **Vancouver** - No Oregon income tax, near Portland jobs, reasonable costs
4. **Olympia** - State capital jobs, JBLM access, median home $516,000
5. **Everett** - Boeing jobs, growing market, median home $618,000
6. **Spokane Valley** - Spokane suburb, slightly cheaper, good schools
7. **Bellingham** - Quality of life, college town, but remote and expensive ($688,000)
8. **Renton** - Seattle suburb, diverse, but pricey (near Seattle levels)
9. **Bellevue** - Highest salaries, but median home $1.5M (only for high earners)
10. **Seattle** - Best jobs/highest pay, but cost of living crushes most budgets

**The honest truth:** If you're making under $80,000/year, avoid Seattle/Bellevue. If you value affordability and still want full VA access and decent jobs, **Spokane or Tacoma** are your best bets. If you're transitioning from JBLM and want to stay near the base/community, **Tacoma, Olympia, or Lakewood** make the most sense.

- Those who want Seattle access with slightly lower costs

### Verdict

**Renton is expensive without Seattle's job market.** Unless you work at Boeing Renton, you're better off in Tacoma (cheaper) or Seattle proper (more jobs). It's a **C+ value for veterans**—not terrible, but not great.

## 9. Bellevue: Highest Salaries, Highest Costs

**Overall Grade: C**

### The Numbers (2025)

- Annual property tax (median home): **$15,000**

**VA Healthcare:**

**Excellent schools:**
- Bellevue School District is top-rated

**Low crime, safe:**
- One of safest cities in WA

**Access to Seattle VA:**
- 10 miles to Seattle VA Medical Center

### Cons

- Rent $2,500-3,500 requires $100,000-140,000 income
- Property taxes $15,000/year even with exemption

**Cost of living eats salary gains:**
- Yes, you make $150,000, but housing costs $4,000/month

## Special Considerations for Veterans

### Property Tax Exemptions Change the Math

If you're **80%+ disabled**, Washington's property tax exemption can save you $3,000-10,000/year depending on county and home value. This **changes the affordability equation**:

**Example: 100% disabled veteran in King County (Seattle)**
- Median home: $980,000
- Standard property tax: $10,290/year
- With exemption (income under $84,000): **$875/year**
- **Savings: $9,415/year**

**This makes Seattle/Bellevue more viable IF:**
- You're 100% P&T disabled
- Your household income (excluding VA disability) is under $84,000
- You can afford the down payment and mortgage

**However:** You still need to qualify for a mortgage on $980,000, which requires significant income or savings. The exemption helps, but doesn't solve the affordability problem entirely.

### JBLM Transition Considerations

If you're separating from JBLM, **60%+ of service members stay in Thurston County** (Olympia area). Here's why:

1. **Community:** Your friends/network from JBLM are here
2. **Schools:** Kids don't have to change schools
3. **Reserve/Guard:** Easy to continue service
4. **VA healthcare:** American Lake VA is 30 minutes north
5. **Employment:** State government, JBLM contractor jobs

**Best JBLM transition cities:**
1. **Tacoma** (10 miles north)
2. **Lakewood** (adjacent to JBLM)
3. **Olympia** (35 miles south)
4. **Puyallup** (20 miles north)

### Remote Work Changes Everything

If you're a **remote worker**, Washington's **no state income tax** is a massive advantage:

- Work for California company: Earn CA salary, pay **$0 state income tax**
- Work for any remote employer: Keep 100% of income (no state tax)

**Best remote work cities:**
1. **Spokane** (lowest cost, full VA)
2. **Vancouver** (no state income tax + Portland culture)
3. **Bellingham** (quality of life)
4. **Olympia** (balance)

### Veteran Population Matters

**Why veteran population size matters:**
- Larger communities = better VFW/American Legion chapters
- More veteran-owned businesses
- Stronger support networks
- Politicians pay attention (voting bloc)

**Largest veteran populations:**
1. King County (Seattle area): 50,000-60,000+
2. Pierce County (Tacoma area): 50,000+
3. Snohomish County (Everett area): 35,000-40,000
4. Thurston County (Olympia area): 30,811
5. Spokane County: 28,000-32,000

## Final Recommendation: The Top 3 for Most Veterans

**1. Spokane** - Best overall value. If you're earning $40,000-80,000 and want affordability + full VA + quality of life, Spokane wins.

**2. Tacoma** - Best for JBLM-area veterans. Proximity to base, excellent VA, strong community, mid-range costs.

**3. Vancouver** - Best for tax optimization. Live in WA (no income tax), access Portland, shop in OR (no sales tax).

**Honorable mention:** Olympia (state jobs), Everett (Boeing).

**Avoid unless high earner:** Seattle, Bellevue.

**Washington offers veterans incredible tax benefits (zero state income tax!), excellent VA healthcare, and strong employment—but you must choose the right city.** Don't let Seattle's high salaries lure you into financial ruin. Run the numbers. Factor in housing costs. And remember: **The best city is the one where you can afford to live comfortably, access VA care, and build the life you want after service.**

**You served your country. Now make your dollars serve you. Choose wisely.**
