# Respiratory Issues Secondary to Burn Pit Exposure: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this?** YES - PACT Act creates presumptions
- **Medical nexus required?** SIMPLIFIED under PACT Act for presumptive conditions
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-100% (depends on respiratory function)
- **Key evidence needed:** Deployment records, respiratory diagnosis, pulmonary function tests
- **Success rate:** SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED under PACT Act (passed 2022)

The PACT Act of 2022 dramatically expanded VA benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic exposures. If you were deployed to covered locations and have respiratory problems, you now have much stronger grounds for VA benefits.

## PACT Act: Game Changer for Burn Pit Claims

### What Is the PACT Act?

**Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022:**
- Signed into law August 2022
- Largest expansion of VA benefits in decades

- Extends VA healthcare eligibility

### Presumptive Service Connection

**What "Presumptive" Means:**
- VA ASSUMES your condition is service-related
- No need to prove exact causation
- Significantly easier approval
- Applies to specific conditions AND locations

### Covered Locations

**Southwest Asia and Other Areas:**
- Iraq
- Afghanistan
- Kuwait
- Saudi Arabia

**Time Period:**
- August 2, 1990 to present

## VA Rating Criteria for Respiratory Conditions

### Chronic Bronchitis/COPD (DC 6600)

| Rating | FEV-1 or FEV-1/FVC |
|--------|-------------------|
| 10% | FEV-1 71-80% or FEV-1/FVC 71-80% |
| 30% | FEV-1 56-70% or FEV-1/FVC 56-70% |
| 60% | FEV-1 40-55% or FEV-1/FVC 40-55% |
| 100% | FEV-1 <40%, FEV-1/FVC <40%, DLCO <40%, max exercise <15 mL/kg/min, cor pulmonale, requires oxygen |

### Asthma (DC 6602)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | FEV-1 71-80%, FEV-1/FVC 71-80%, or intermittent inhalational/oral bronchodilator therapy |
| 30% | FEV-1 56-70%, FEV-1/FVC 56-70%, or daily inhalational/oral bronchodilator therapy or inhalational anti-inflammatory |
| 60% | FEV-1 40-55%, FEV-1/FVC 40-55%, at least monthly use of systemic corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive medications |
| 100% | FEV-1 <40%, FEV-1/FVC <40%, or >3 asthma attacks/year requiring emergency care |

### Interstitial Lung Disease/Pulmonary Fibrosis (DC 6825)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | FVC 75-80% predicted |
| 30% | FVC 65-74% predicted or DLCO 56-65% predicted |
| 60% | FVC 50-64% predicted or DLCO 40-55% predicted |
| 100% | FVC <50%, DLCO <40%, max exercise <15 mL/kg/min, requires oxygen, or cor pulmonale |

### Constrictive Bronchiolitis (DC 6600 by analogy)

- Rated similarly to COPD
- Based on pulmonary function
- Often requires lung biopsy for diagnosis

## Evidence You Need

### For Presumptive Conditions

**Required:**
1. Deployment records showing service in covered location
2. Diagnosis of presumptive condition
3. Current pulmonary function tests

**That's It for Presumptive!**

### If Not Presumptive (Or to Strengthen Claim)

**Additional Evidence:**
- Burn pit registry enrollment
- Lay statements about exposure
- Deployment location details
- Photos/documentation of burn pits
- Medical records showing symptom onset
- Nexus letter (if non-presumptive)

### Key Medical Tests

**Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):**
- FEV-1 (forced expiratory volume)
- FVC (forced vital capacity)
- FEV-1/FVC ratio
- DLCO (diffusion capacity)

**Other Tests:**
- Chest X-ray
- CT scan
- Bronchoscopy (for some conditions)
- Lung biopsy (constrictive bronchiolitis)

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Gather Deployment Records

Obtain:
- DD-214
- Deployment orders
- Service records showing locations served

### Step 2: Register in Burn Pit Registry

VA Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry:
- Free enrollment
- Documents your exposure
- Supports your claim
- Online at VA.gov

### Step 3: Get Diagnosed

See pulmonologist:
- Formal respiratory diagnosis
- Pulmonary function tests
- Imaging as appropriate

### Step 4: File Your Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Check "toxic exposure" related
- Include deployment dates/locations
- Upload evidence

### Step 5: C&P Exam

- Pulmonary examination
- PFTs will be performed
- Describe symptoms thoroughly
- Mention burn pit exposure

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not registering in Burn Pit Registry** - Easy evidence; do this now

2. **Missing deployment documentation** - Get complete records

3. **Not getting PFTs** - Required for rating

4. **Waiting too long** - File as soon as diagnosed

5. **Not knowing presumptive list** - Check if your condition qualifies

6. **Old thinking about nexus** - PACT Act changed the game

7. **Downplaying symptoms at exam** - Be accurate about limitations

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to prove I was near a burn pit?**
A: No, for presumptive conditions. Service in covered locations is enough.

**Q: What if my condition isn't on the presumptive list?**
A: You can still claim with nexus evidence. PACT Act made this easier too.

**Q: Do I need a nexus letter now?**
A: Not for presumptive conditions. The presumption IS the nexus.

**Q: Should I register in the burn pit registry?**
A: Yes! It's free, easy, and supports your claim.

**Q: What if I deployed before 1990?**
A: Different presumptions may apply. Check specific eligibility.

**Q: Can I claim if I already have a respiratory rating?**
A: If your condition is worse, file for increase.

**Q: What about conditions that appear later?**
A: Many presumptive conditions have timeframes. Check specific condition.
