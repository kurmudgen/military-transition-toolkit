## 90-Day Transition Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Foundation
**Week 1:** CCAF transcript, clearance verification, document systems/tools, gather EPRs
**Week 2:** Apply for Security+ via COOL, begin study, register for exam 60 days out
**Week 3:** Resume (civilian terms), LinkedIn profile, join groups, connect with 1D7s at companies
**Week 4:** Apply to 10 positions (5 defense contractor, 5 commercial), set job alerts

### Days 31-60: Execution
**Week 5:** Complete Security+ exam, add to resume immediately
**Week 6:** Build home lab (Security Onion, Splunk free, VirtualBox), practice SOC skills
**Week 7:** Networking - join local ISSA/ISC2 chapters, attend virtual conferences
**Week 8:** Apply to 15-20 more positions, follow up on Week 4 applications

### Days 61-90: Launch
**Week 9:** Interview circuit, prepare for technical questions, continue applications
**Week 10:** Evaluate offers, negotiate using market data, verify clearance transfer
**Week 11:** Begin advanced cert study (CISSP or GCIH), complete within 6 months post-separation
**Week 12:** Final out-processing, coordinate start date, relocate if needed

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. Not Getting Security+ Before Separation:** Many wait until civilian job requires it. Get it free via COOL. Required for most positions. Takes 2-3 months.

**2. Underselling Experience:** Saying "I monitored networks" vs "I operated 24/7 SOC protecting 10,000-user enterprise from advanced threats." Quantify and contextualize.

**3. Limiting to Defense Contractors:** Commercial SOCs pay equally well without clearance stress. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, tech companies need SOC analysts.

**4. No Home Lab:** Employers want to see continued learning. Build home security lab. Practice with free tools. Shows initiative.

**5. Starting Job Hunt Too Late:** SOC positions hire quickly but process takes 60-90 days for cleared roles. Start 6-12 months before DOS.

## Interview Preparation

### How to Explain Experience

"I served as a Cyber Defense Operations specialist—1D7X1—in the Air Force for [X] years. My role was defensive cybersecurity: operating Security Operations Centers, monitoring networks for threats, investigating incidents, and implementing defensive countermeasures.

I worked with SIEM platforms analyzing thousands of security events daily. I responded to real security incidents including malware, unauthorized access, and data breaches. I conducted vulnerability assessments and coordinated remediation. I maintained Top Secret clearance working on sensitive defense networks.

This experience gave me practical defensive security skills, incident response capabilities, and ability to work under pressure in 24/7 operations environment—exactly what SOC analyst roles require."

**Common Questions:**
**Q: "Walk me through incident response process"**
A: [STAR method]: Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned. [Give specific example]

**Q: "What SIEM platforms have you used?"**
A: [List DoD tools, emphasize transferable skills to Splunk/commercial SIEMs]
