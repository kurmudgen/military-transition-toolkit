# Nebraska Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Nebraska's best tax benefit for veterans is the 100% exemption of military retirement pay from state income tax—a benefit that saves the average military retiree about $1,800 annually. The state also offers a full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans with no income cap or dollar limit, potentially saving $5,000+ per year on a median-priced home.

If you're a 100% disabled veteran, Nebraska's property tax exemption applies to your entire homestead value with no restrictions, which is better than many neighboring states. Military retirees benefit from full income tax exemption regardless of age, putting Nebraska ahead of Iowa (where only 65+ get the exemption) and Missouri (which taxes military retirement partially).

The downside? Nebraska doesn't offer property tax breaks for veterans with disability ratings below 100%, making it less attractive if you're rated at 50-90%. Property taxes are also relatively high in Nebraska (averaging around 2% of home value), so non-disabled veterans and lower-rated disabled veterans will feel the pinch.

Overall, Nebraska ranks as a tax-friendly state for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees, but average for other veterans. If you're planning to retire here, you'll save thousands annually on income taxes, but you'll want to factor in higher-than-average property taxes unless you qualify for the disabled veteran exemption.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Exemption amount: 100% of assessed property value
- Cap: None—unlimited exemption
- Requirements: Must have 100% permanent and total (P&T) service-connected disability OR 100% temporary service-connected disability from the VA
- Annual savings: $5,000-$6,500 (based on median home values in major Nebraska counties)

If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, your primary residence is completely exempt from property taxes. There's no income limit and no cap on home value. Whether your house is worth $200,000 or $500,000, you pay zero property tax. This is one of the most generous property tax exemptions in the Midwest.

You can also qualify with a 100% temporary disability rating (not just P&T), which is broader than some states. As long as you're drawing 100% VA compensation, you're covered.

**70-90% Disabled:**
- Exemption: None
- Savings: $0

Nebraska doesn't offer partial property tax exemptions for veterans rated 70-90% disabled. Recent legislation (LB425) proposed extending exemptions to veterans with 80%+ disability ratings, but as of 2025, this hasn't been enacted. If passed, it would take effect January 1, 2026.

**50-60% Disabled:**
- Exemption: None
- Savings: $0

No property tax relief for this rating level either. The state legislature is considering changes, but for now, it's 100% disabled or nothing.

**Under 50% / General Veterans:**
- Standard homestead: Available if you meet income requirements
- General exemptions: None specifically for veterans

Non-disabled veterans can apply for Nebraska's general homestead exemption if they're 65+ or have certain disabilities, but there's no veteran-specific benefit below 100%.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your county assessor's office** (Douglas, Lancaster, Sarpy, or your county of residence)
2. **Gather required documents** (see list below)
3. **File application between February 1 and June 30** of the filing year

**Documents Needed:**
- VA award letter showing 100% service-connected disability (permanent or temporary)
- DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
- Proof of Nebraska residency
- Property deed or mortgage statement
- Photo ID

**Application Timeline:**
- Filing window: February 1–June 30, 2025
- Special note: Category 4V (100% permanent service-connected) applications must be filed in years ending in 0 or 5 (2025, 2030, etc.), then renew every 5 years
- Processing: Typically 30-60 days
- Effective: Tax year you apply (retroactive if filed before deadline)

**Important:** If you have 100% P&T, you only need to reapply every five years. If you have 100% temporary, you may need to verify your status more frequently.

### Property Tax by County

Nebraska has some of the highest property tax rates in the nation. Here's how major counties compare:

| County | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Annual Savings (100% Disabled) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Douglas (Omaha) | $280,000 | 2.16% | $6,048 | $6,048 |
| Lancaster (Lincoln) | $285,000 | 1.99% | $5,672 | $5,672 |
| Sarpy (Bellevue/Papillion) | $290,000 | 2.18% | $6,322 | $6,322 |
| Hall (Grand Island) | $185,000 | 1.85% | $3,423 | $3,423 |
| Buffalo (Kearney) | $205,000 | 1.92% | $3,936 | $3,936 |
| Madison (Norfolk) | $175,000 | 1.88% | $3,290 | $3,290 |
| Scotts Bluff | $160,000 | 1.76% | $2,816 | $2,816 |

Sarpy County has the highest property tax rate at 2.18%, meaning a 100% disabled veteran saves over $6,300 annually. Even in less expensive rural counties, you're saving $2,800-$3,500 per year.

**Payment Deadlines:** In Sarpy, Lancaster, and Douglas counties, taxes are due April 1 and August 1. In most other Nebraska counties, they're due May 1 and September 1.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: 100% exempt
- Annual savings: $1,200-$2,400 (depending on retirement income and tax bracket)

Nebraska fully exempts military retirement pay from state income tax as of January 1, 2022. This applies to all branches: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force, USPHS Commissioned Corps, and NOAA Corps officers.

**Who qualifies:** Anyone receiving military retirement benefits reported on IRS Form 1099-R issued by the Department of Defense or Office of Personnel Management.

**How it works:** You don't need to file any special forms. Simply exclude your military retirement income when calculating Nebraska taxable income. If you use tax software, indicate that your 1099-R is military retirement, and it'll automatically be excluded from Nebraska taxes.

**Example calculation:**
- Annual military retirement: $40,000
- Nebraska tax rate: ~5% (average marginal rate)
- Annual savings: $2,000

If you're an O-5 retiree with $60,000 annual pension, you save about $3,000 per year compared to states that fully tax military retirement.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt (like all states)
- Tax-free federally and at the state level

All VA disability compensation is tax-free. Nebraska doesn't tax it, and neither does the federal government. This is standard across all states.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Taxation: 100% exempt from Nebraska state income tax
- Details: Survivor Benefit Plan payments to military spouses/dependents are treated the same as military retirement pay

Nebraska exempts SBP payments from state income tax, which is a big deal for surviving spouses. Many states tax SBP, but Nebraska doesn't.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Subject to Nebraska income tax (not exempt)
- **Combat pay:** Generally exempt from federal tax; Nebraska follows federal treatment
- **Active duty pay:** Taxable by Nebraska unless you're a non-resident stationed in Nebraska under the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act

If you're an active duty service member stationed at Offutt AFB but maintain legal residency in another state, you're not subject to Nebraska income tax on your military pay.

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: Standard registration fees apply (not free)
- Requirements: Must be 10%+ service-connected disabled and enrolled in the Nebraska Veterans Registry
- Annual savings: $0 (fees still apply)

Nebraska offers special Disabled American Veteran (DAV) license plates, but they don't waive registration fees. You'll still pay regular vehicle registration costs, which vary by vehicle type and weight.

**Motor Vehicle Tax Exemption:**
- Eligibility: Veterans who lost use of or had amputation of two or more extremities, OR amputation of one extremity plus loss of use of another
- Benefit: One motor vehicle exempt from motor vehicle taxes
- Savings: Varies by vehicle value (typically $200-$500 annually)

This exemption is narrow—it only applies to severely disabled veterans with specific mobility impairments. You need to apply with your county treasurer.

**Registration Fees:**
- No general veteran exemptions
- Standard fees: $15-$30+ depending on vehicle

**Parking privileges:** DAV plates do NOT allow you to park in handicapped spaces. You need separate handicapped plates or a permit for that.

## Sales Tax Exemptions

- Vehicle purchases: No exemption for veterans
- Other items: No general sales tax exemptions
- State sales tax rate: 5.5% (local taxes may add 0.5%-2%)

Nebraska doesn't offer sales tax breaks for veterans on vehicle purchases or other goods. You'll pay the standard 5.5% state sales tax plus any local option taxes.

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% Disabled Veteran Example (Omaha):**
- Property tax saved: $6,048
- Income tax saved (military retirement): $2,000
- Vehicle tax saved: $0 (unless you qualify for motor vehicle exemption)
- **Total Annual Savings: $8,048**

Over 20 years, that's $160,960 in tax savings.

**70% Rating:**
- Property tax saved: $0
- Income tax saved (military retirement): $2,000
- Vehicle tax saved: $0
- **Total savings: $2,000/year**

**50% Rating:**
- Property tax saved: $0
- Income tax saved (military retirement): $2,000
- **Total savings: $2,000/year**

**Military retiree with no VA disability:**
- Income tax saved: $2,000/year
- **Total savings: $2,000/year**

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled:**
- Annual savings: $8,048
- 20-year total: $160,960
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $119,800

**70% Rating:**
- Annual savings: $2,000
- 20-year total: $40,000
- Net present value: $29,800

**50% Rating:**
- Annual savings: $2,000
- 20-year total: $40,000
- Net present value: $29,800

**Military Retiree (No VA rating):**
- Annual savings: $2,000
- 20-year total: $40,000
- Net present value: $29,800

The big benefit in Nebraska is for 100% disabled veterans. Everyone else saves a flat $2,000/year from the military retirement exemption, which is solid but not exceptional.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Tax Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled) |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Nebraska** | Fully exempt | Full exemption, no cap | $8,048 |
| Iowa | Exempt if 55+ | $1,852 max exemption | $3,852 |
| South Dakota | No income tax | No property tax exemption | ~$4,000 (income tax savings) |
| Kansas | Exempt if retired after 1976 | $16,744 exemption (2024) | $5,700 |
| Missouri | Partially exempt | Varies by county | $4,200 |
| Wyoming | No income tax | No specific veteran exemption | $3,500 (income tax savings) |

**Verdict:** Nebraska ranks #1 among neighbors for 100% disabled veterans due to unlimited property tax exemption plus full military retirement exemption. For non-disabled military retirees, South Dakota and Wyoming edge ahead since they have no income tax at all (though you're already exempt from Nebraska income tax on retirement pay).

## State vs National Comparison

- **Property tax exemption:** Better than most states—Nebraska's no-cap policy for 100% disabled is in the top tier nationally
- **Income tax treatment:** Excellent—full exemption for military retirement puts Nebraska in the top 25% of states
- **Overall ranking:** Top 10 nationally for 100% disabled veterans; middle of the pack for veterans with lower ratings

According to studies by Veterans United and VA Claims Insider, Nebraska ranks in the top 15 states for veteran tax benefits when you're 100% disabled.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- 100% P&T disabled veterans (save $8,000+/year in Omaha/Lincoln metro)
- Military retirees with pensions over $40,000 (save $2,000-$3,000/year on income tax)
- Disabled veterans with higher home values (unlimited property tax exemption scales with home value)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans rated 50-90% disabled (no property tax break)
- Veterans without military retirement income (won't benefit from income tax exemption)
- Active duty stationed at Offutt AFB who maintain out-of-state residency (already exempt from NE tax)

**Better options:**
- If you're 70% disabled and want property tax relief, look at Kansas ($16,744 exemption for 50%+ disabled) or Oklahoma (full exemption for 50%+)
- If you're a military retiree with no disability and want zero income tax, consider South Dakota, Texas, Florida, or Wyoming

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- Nebraska estate tax: Repealed in 2007—no state estate tax
- Nebraska inheritance tax: Yes, but with exemptions
- Veteran exemptions: None specifically for veterans

Nebraska has an inheritance tax (not an estate tax). Immediate relatives (spouse, children, grandchildren, parents) are exempt. Other beneficiaries pay 13-18% on inheritances over $15,000. There's no special veteran exemption.

### Other Tax Benefits

**Income Tax Exemptions:**
- Social Security: Not taxed by Nebraska
- Railroad retirement: Partially exempt
- Military retirement: Fully exempt (as discussed)

**Homestead Exemption (Non-Veteran):**
- Available to homeowners 65+ or totally disabled
- Income limits apply
- Reduces taxable property value

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Apply for property tax exemption immediately if you're 100% disabled.** File between February 1–June 30, 2025. Don't wait—you could be losing $500+ per month.

2. **Update your Nebraska tax withholding if you're a military retiree.** Since your retirement pay is exempt, adjust your W-4 with DFAS to stop over-withholding Nebraska tax. Get your money now instead of waiting for a refund.

3. **Check your county's assessment.** Even with 100% exemption, make sure your property is assessed correctly. If your home is over-assessed, it could affect your homeowners insurance and future refinancing.

4. **Apply for motor vehicle tax exemption if you qualify.** If you lost use of two or more extremities, contact your county treasurer. This is a separate application from the property tax exemption.

5. **Consider buying in a lower-tax county.** If you don't qualify for the property tax exemption, Hall, Madison, or Scotts Bluff counties have lower rates than Douglas/Sarpy.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Missing the filing deadline:** Applications are due by June 30. If you miss it, you'll pay full property tax for that year.

- **Not reapplying for 100% temporary disability:** If your rating is 100% temporary (not P&T), verify how often you need to renew. Don't assume it's automatic.

- **Claiming DAV plates thinking they're free:** They're not. You'll still pay registration fees.

- **Forgetting to notify DFAS about Nebraska tax exemption:** Update your withholding to keep more money in your paycheck.

- **Assuming 70% or 80% disabled qualifies:** As of 2025, only 100% disabled veterans get property tax exemption. Watch for LB425 legislation that may change this in 2026.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?**

A: No. If you have 100% permanent and total (P&T) disability, you only reapply every five years (2025, 2030, etc.). If you have 100% temporary disability, check with your county assessor—requirements vary.

**Q: Can I get the property tax exemption if I'm 90% disabled?**

A: Not as of 2025. Only 100% disabled veterans qualify. Legislation is pending (LB425) that may extend the benefit to 80%+ disabled veterans starting in 2026.

**Q: Does the property tax exemption apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. It only applies to your primary residence (homestead).

**Q: I just retired from the military. How do I make sure Nebraska doesn't tax my retirement pay?**

A: When you file your Nebraska state tax return, exclude military retirement income from your taxable income. If you use tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block, indicate that your 1099-R is military retirement. Nebraska won't tax it.

**Q: Can I get both the 100% disabled veteran property tax exemption AND the regular homestead exemption?**

A: Check with your county assessor. Generally, you receive whichever benefit is greater, but some counties may allow stacking under certain circumstances.

**Q: Do I pay property tax while my application is being processed?**

A: Yes, but if approved, the exemption is retroactive to January 1 of the tax year you applied (if you filed by June 30). You may receive a refund.

**Q: I'm 100% disabled due to PTSD. Do I qualify for the property tax exemption?**

A: Yes. The exemption applies to any 100% service-connected disability, regardless of the condition. It doesn't have to be physical.

**Q: Does Nebraska tax VA disability compensation?**

A: No. VA disability compensation is tax-free federally and in every state, including Nebraska.

**Q: What's the difference between the disabled veteran property tax exemption and the homestead exemption?**

A: The homestead exemption is a general tax relief program for seniors and low-income homeowners with income limits. The disabled veteran exemption is specifically for 100% service-connected disabled veterans with no income limits and a full exemption.

**Q: I'm stationed at Offutt AFB but my home of record is Florida. Do I pay Nebraska income tax?**

A: No, as long as you maintain Florida residency. Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, you're not subject to Nebraska income tax on your military pay if you're a legal resident of another state.

**Q: Does my surviving spouse keep the property tax exemption if I die?**

A: Surviving spouses may qualify for certain exemptions under Nebraska law, but rules vary. Contact your county assessor immediately to understand your options.

**Q: Are National Guard and Reserve retirement payments exempt from Nebraska income tax?**

A: Yes. Guard and Reserve retirement (including "grey area" retired pay) is treated the same as active duty retirement—fully exempt from Nebraska state tax.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I overpaid property taxes before I knew about the exemption?**

A: Generally, you can only get a refund for the current tax year. If you recently became 100% disabled, apply immediately and you may get a partial-year refund. For prior years, it's unlikely, but consult your county treasurer.

**Q: Does the vehicle registration exemption apply to all veterans?**

A: No. The motor vehicle tax exemption only applies to veterans who lost use of or had amputation of two or more extremities, or one amputation plus loss of use of another extremity. It's a very specific eligibility requirement.

**Q: If I move to Nebraska mid-year, can I still get the property tax exemption?**

A: Yes, but you must establish Nebraska residency and apply by June 30. The exemption typically applies starting the year you establish residency.
