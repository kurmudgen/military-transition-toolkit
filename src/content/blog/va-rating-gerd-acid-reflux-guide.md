# VA Rating for GERD and Acid Reflux: Complete Compensation Guide

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects an estimated 20-30% of post-service veterans. While often overlooked compared to more visible injuries, GERD creates significant functional impairment, impacts quality of life, and can develop secondary complications. Many veterans don't realize GERD qualifies for VA disability compensation when service-connected. Understanding rating criteria and evidence requirements is essential for claiming benefits.

## Understanding GERD and Military Service Connection

GERD is a chronic condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn, regurgitation, and potential complications. Military service creates conditions promoting GERD development:

**Occupational Stress**: Military stress increases stomach acid production and relaxes esophageal sphincter

**Irregular Sleep Patterns**: Military schedules disrupt normal digestion and sleep quality

**Poor Dietary Conditions**: Field conditions, MREs (Meals Ready to Eat), and limited meal timing

**Exposure to Chemicals**: Some military occupations involve chemical exposure potentially damaging digestive system

**Medication Effects**: Certain military medications (NSAIDs for pain) increase GERD risk

**Combat-Related Stress**: PTSD and anxiety significantly worsen reflux symptoms

**Heat Injuries**: Severe dehydration during training contributes to GERD development

The VA recognizes GERD (Diagnostic Code 7346) as service-connected when evidence supports military causation.

## VA Rating System for GERD

The VA rates GERD based on functional limitation from symptoms and treatment requirements rather than diagnosis alone.

### Rating Percentages

**0% (Not Rated)** - No functional impairment; occasional mild reflux symptoms

**10% Rating** - Minimal functional impairment:
- Symptoms controlled with minimal medication
- Occasional breakthrough symptoms despite treatment
- Minimal occupational or social impact
- Normal diet tolerated with minor adjustments

**20% Rating** - Mild functional impairment:
- Symptoms require regular medication
- Occasional medication adjustments needed
- Some dietary restrictions
- Mild occupational impact (avoiding certain foods at work)

**30% Rating** - Moderate functional impairment:
- Symptoms poorly controlled despite medication
- Multiple medication trials or significant dosages
- Significant dietary restrictions
- Moderate occupational impact
- Mild sleep disruption

**40% Rating** - Moderately severe functional impairment:
- Severe symptoms despite aggressive treatment
- Multiple medications required
- Significant dietary limitations
- Substantial occupational restrictions
- Sleep disruption affecting function
- Work capacity affected

**50%-100% Rating** - Severe functional impairment:
- Refractory GERD unresponsive to medical management
- Frequent severe symptoms despite multiple treatments
- Severe dietary restrictions
- Major occupational disability
- Potential esophageal damage or complications

## Monthly Compensation for GERD

Monthly compensation varies by rating and dependent status. As of 2025:

**10% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $175-$185/month

**20% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $253-$270/month

**30% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $330-$350/month

**40% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $470-$490/month

**50% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $605-$625/month

These amounts increase annually with COLA. Your effective date determines your rate and back pay eligibility.

## Evidence Requirements for GERD Claims

## Nexus Letter for GERD Claims

A nexus letter from a gastroenterologist or primary care physician establishing service connection is critical for GERD claims.

### Essential Components

**Medical Opinion**
Statement that GERD is "at least as likely as not" caused by military service or its effects.

**Service-Related Cause**
Explanation of how service caused or significantly aggravated GERD:
- Chronic military stress triggering acid production
- Poor dietary conditions during service
- Sleep disruption from military demands
- Secondary to PTSD or anxiety from combat
- Medication side effects from military treatments

**Medical Evidence Review**
Reference diagnostic records and treatment history.

**Functional Impact Assessment**
Description of resulting functional limitations.

### Quality Nexus Providers

- **VA Gastroenterologists**: Free through VA gastroenterology
- **Private Gastroenterologists**: Board-certified specialists ($400-$800)
- **VA Primary Care Physicians**: May provide nexus letters
- **Civilian Primary Care Providers**: Familiar with military service context
- **Telehealth Services**: Specialized VA providers ($300-$600)

## C&P Exam Preparation

The VA sometimes schedules C&P exams for GERD claims. These are typically conducted by internists or gastroenterologists.

### Exam Components

**Medical History**:
- GERD symptom onset and progression
- Relationship to military service
- Current symptoms and frequency
- Treatment history
- Medication list
- Dietary restrictions
- Sleep impact

**Physical Examination**:
- Abdominal examination for tenderness, distension
- Weight and height
- General health assessment

**Functional Assessment**:
- Occupational impact from GERD
- Social impact of dietary restrictions
- Sleep disruption effects
- Treatment burden assessment

### Preparation Tips

- **Document Medication History**: Bring complete list of all GERD medications tried
- **Describe Symptoms Specifically**: Not just "heartburn" but "severe acid reflux 3-4 times daily despite medication"
- **Note Occupational Impact**: "I can't eat lunch with coworkers due to symptoms," "I can't attend evening events due to nighttime reflux"
- **Mention Dietary Restrictions**: List foods you avoid
- **Sleep Disruption**: "I can't sleep flat; must elevate head 45 degrees"
- **Treatment Burden**: Describe time spent on medication management, dietary planning
- **Progression**: Explain how GERD has worsened or remained severe despite treatment

The examiner evaluates both medical documentation and your description of functional impact.

## Real Claim Examples

### Case 1: PTSD-Related GERD

A former infantryman filed for GERD secondary to PTSD. Evidence included:
- VA psychiatry records documenting PTSD (70% rated)
- Gastroenterology records showing severe GERD
- Documentation: GERD symptoms worsened during anxiety episodes
- Medication list showing multiple GERD medication trials
- Nexus letter from VA gastroenterologist connecting PTSD-induced anxiety to GERD

**Outcome**: 30% GERD rating. Combined with 70% PTSD = 80% overall. Monthly compensation: $2,500. Back pay: $10,500.

### Case 2: Combat Stress with Refractory GERD

A veteran with 10 years combat service filed with:
- Military medical records documenting reflux complaints during service
- Current gastroenterology records showing persistent severe symptoms
- Medication history showing failed trials of multiple medications
- Statement of occupational restriction: "Can't perform job duties requiring meal participation"
- Medical opinion on service connection

**Outcome**: 40% GERD rating. Monthly compensation: $490.

### Case 3: Delayed Onset GERD Claim

A veteran filed 3 years post-discharge for GERD developing shortly after service:
- Medical records documenting GERD diagnosis 6 months post-discharge
- Detailed statement about military stress contributing to GERD
- Family statement: "GERD started immediately after military service"
- Current gastroenterology records showing ongoing symptoms

**Outcome**: 20% GERD rating. Effective date: Discharge date. Back pay: $8,100.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Functional Impact
Simply filing a GERD claim without documenting functional limitation weakens the claim.

**Solution**: Detail occupational restrictions, dietary limitations, and sleep disruption.

### Mistake 2: Missing Service Connection Explanation
Not explaining how military service caused or aggravated GERD.

**Solution**: Clearly connect GERD to military stress, MRE diet, or other service factors in your statement.

### Mistake 3: No Nexus Letter
Many GERD denials result from lack of professional medical nexus.

**Solution**: Obtain nexus letter from gastroenterologist or primary care provider.

### Mistake 4: Incomplete Medication Documentation
Failing to list all GERD medications attempted.

**Solution**: Provide comprehensive medication history showing treatment attempts and current regimen.

### Mistake 5: No Secondary Condition Connection
If GERD develops from PTSD or other service-connected condition, failing to file it as secondary.

**Solution**: Explicitly file GERD as secondary to primary condition in your statement.

## Secondary Conditions

Veterans with GERD may develop:
- **Esophageal Stricture**: GERD-related tissue damage (10-50% rating)
- **Barrett's Esophagus**: Precancerous condition (10-100% rating)
- **Anxiety/Depression**: From chronic GERD impact (10-100% rating)
- **Sleep Disorders**: From nighttime reflux (10-100% rating)
- **Medication Side Effects**: From high-dose GERD medications

Filing secondary conditions increases total compensation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get disability for GERD if it's controlled with medication?**
A: Yes. Rating is based on the condition itself, not just uncontrolled symptoms. Medication requirements factor into rating determination.

**Q: Is GERD secondary to PTSD automatically approved?**
A: Not automatically, but having both PTSD and GERD significantly strengthens the claim. Nexus letter should explicitly connect the two.

**Q: What if I developed GERD years after military discharge?**
A: Still potentially service-connected if military service was the cause (stress, MRE diet, etc.). Timing is less important than causation.

**Q: Should I try stronger medications before filing?**
A: Not necessary. File with current treatment status. If you try stronger medications post-filing, that supports claim.

**Q: Can I file for both GERD and another digestive condition?**
A: Yes, if both service-connected, they'd be rated separately and combined.

## Conclusion

GERD represents a winnable VA disability category when properly documented with clear functional limitation and service connection. While less visible than physical injuries, GERD significantly impacts daily functioning and occupational capacity.

Start your claim through VA.gov, your VA Regional Office, or with VSO assistance. Proper documentation of symptoms, medication history, and functional limitations combined with a strong nexus letter leads to successful approvals.

With persistence and comprehensive evidence, most veterans successfully secure GERD disability ratings and meaningful compensation for service-connected gastroesophageal reflux disease.
