## Understanding Generalized Anxiety Disorder VA Ratings

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is rated under 38 CFR § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9400 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) using the general formula for mental disorders. The VA evaluates GAD based on the frequency, severity, and duration of anxiety symptoms and their impact on occupational and social functioning.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 0% Rating
**Criteria:** A mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Diagnosed GAD but symptoms minimal or in remission
- No medication required or only as-needed use
- Can work full-time without issues
- Social functioning normal
- No significant impairment in daily activities
- May have had anxiety in past but currently well-controlled

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Mild anxiety symptoms managed with daily medication
- Occasional worry or nervousness
- Concentration difficulties during stressful periods
- Can maintain employment but with some difficulty during high-stress times
- Social life generally intact
- Symptoms controlled by medication
- Minimal functional impairment overall

#### 30% Rating
**Criteria:** Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss.

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Current Diagnosis

You need a formal diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder from a qualified mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, or LCSW).

**DSM-5 Criteria for GAD:**
- Excessive anxiety and worry about various events or activities
- Occurs more days than not for at least 6 months
- Difficult to control the worry
- Associated with three or more of:
  - Restlessness or feeling keyed up/on edge
  - Being easily fatigued
  - Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
  - Irritability
  - Muscle tension
  - Sleep disturbance
- Causes significant distress or impairment
- Not due to substances or medical condition

**Best Practices:**
- Seek treatment from mental health specialist
- Document all anxiety symptoms with provider
- Get ongoing treatment showing symptom course
- Request Mental Health DBQ completion
- Track panic attacks, physical symptoms, avoidance behaviors

### 2. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Anxiety began during military service
- Service medical records showing anxiety symptoms
- Stressful service events (combat, deployment, training accidents, MST)
- Nexus linking current GAD to service experiences

**Secondary Service Connection (Very Common):**
- GAD secondary to another service-connected condition
- Most common primaries: PTSD, TBI, chronic pain, tinnitus, sleep apnea
- Medical opinion stating GAD caused or aggravated by primary condition
- Timeline showing anxiety developed after primary condition

**Aggravation:**
- Pre-existing mild anxiety significantly worsened by military service
- Evidence of anxiety before service vs. severe anxiety after
- Medical opinion on aggravation

### 3. Nexus Opinion

A medical professional must opine that your GAD is "at least as likely as not" (50% or greater probability) related to military service or a service-connected condition.

**Strong Nexus Letter Includes:**
- Provider credentials and expertise
- Review of service and medical records
- Timeline analysis (when anxiety began/worsened)
- Medical rationale for connection
- Clear "at least as likely as not" statement
- References to medical literature if applicable

**Example for Secondary GAD:**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's Generalized Anxiety Disorder is secondary to their service-connected PTSD. Chronic hyperarousal, hypervigilance, and stress from PTSD commonly lead to generalized anxiety. The temporal relationship supports this, as GAD symptoms emerged after PTSD diagnosis."

### 4. Functional Impact Documentation

**Employment Evidence:**
- Performance reviews showing anxiety-related issues
- Attendance problems (sick days, early departures)
- Disciplinary actions for concentration problems
- Job loss or inability to maintain employment
- Reduction in work hours
- Accommodations needed

**Medical Records:**
- Treatment frequency and type
- Medications (especially increases/changes)
- Emergency room visits for panic attacks
- Hospitalizations
- Therapy notes documenting severity
- Failed medication trials

**Personal Statement:**
- Daily life description with anxiety impact
- Specific symptoms and frequency
- How anxiety limits work, relationships, activities
- Panic attack descriptions
- Avoidance behaviors
- Physical symptoms

**Lay Statements:**
- Family/friends describing observable changes
- Before and after service comparisons
- Specific examples of anxiety limiting veteran
- Impact on relationships and family life

- **Functional impact:** What you can't do because of anxiety

**2. Track Anxiety Patterns:**
Keep a log for 2-4 weeks before exam:
- Daily anxiety levels (1-10 scale)
- Panic attack frequency
- What triggers anxiety
- How anxiety affects daily activities
- Medications taken and effectiveness
- Sleep quality

**3. Prepare Functional Impact Examples:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get separate ratings for both GAD and PTSD?
Possibly, but only if symptoms are clearly distinct. Often they overlap significantly and are rated under one diagnosis. Work with your provider to differentiate symptoms if they truly are separate conditions.

### How is GAD different from PTSD for VA rating purposes?
Both use the same rating criteria (38 CFR 4.130). The difference is in the diagnosis and symptom pattern. PTSD is related to specific traumatic stressors; GAD involves excessive worry across many areas of life.

### Will panic attacks automatically get me a higher rating?
Panic attacks are specifically mentioned in the rating criteria. Weekly panic attacks are consistent with 30%, more than weekly with 50%. However, overall functional impairment is the key factor.

### Can I work and still get VA disability for anxiety?
Yes, unless claiming TDIU. However, your ability to work affects your rating level. Higher ratings require significant occupational impairment.

### What if my anxiety is from medication side effects?
Anxiety caused by medication for a service-connected condition can be rated as secondary to that condition. Document the timeline and get medical opinion linking the two.

### Should I see a psychiatrist or psychologist for GAD?
Either can diagnose and treat GAD. Psychiatrists prescribe medication. Psychologists typically don't prescribe but provide therapy. Both can provide nexus opinions. See whomever you're comfortable with and can access.

### How do I prove GAD is secondary to my physical condition?
Get a medical opinion from your mental health provider stating that your anxiety is caused by your physical condition. Document how worry about the physical condition dominates your thoughts. Show temporal relationship.

### Will my anxiety rating be reduced if I get better?
Ratings can be reduced if your condition improves. However, continue appropriate treatment and document ongoing symptoms. Mental health conditions often wax and wane.

### What if I have anxiety but no panic attacks?
You can still receive a rating. Panic attacks are just one symptom. GAD is diagnosed based on excessive worry, physical symptoms, and functional impairment - panic attacks aren't required.

### Can I get 100% for anxiety alone?
Yes, if your anxiety symptoms cause total occupational and social impairment. This is rare but possible with severe, treatment-resistant GAD, especially with agoraphobia.

### How long does an anxiety claim take?
Initial claims average 130-180 days. Secondary claims may be faster if the primary condition is already established. Appeals can take 1-3 years.

### Should I stop my anxiety medication before the C&P exam?
Absolutely not. Never stop prescribed medication. The rating considers your condition with treatment. Stopping medication is dangerous and won't help your claim.

### What if VA says my anxiety isn't service-connected?
Appeal with additional evidence. Get an Independent Medical Opinion (IMO). Consider secondary service connection to another condition. Use a VSO or attorney for guidance.

### Does GAD count toward TDIU eligibility?
Yes. Mental health conditions, including GAD, are one of the most common reasons veterans qualify for unemployability benefits.
