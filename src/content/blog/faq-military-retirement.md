## RETIREMENT PAY (Q476-Q485)

### Q476: How is military retirement pay calculated? {#q476}

**A:** Military retirement pay is calculated using the formula (Years of Service × 2.5%) × Base Pay at retirement, meaning a 20-year retiree receives 50% of base pay, with the calculation method varying based on when you entered service (High-3, BRS, or Redux systems).

Understanding your retirement system and calculation is crucial for financial planning.

**Three retirement systems:**

Your retirement system depends on when you entered military service:

**1. High-3 System (Legacy)**
*If you entered before Jan 1, 2018 and didn't opt into BRS*

**Formula:**
> (Years of Service × 2.5%) × Average of Highest 36 Months Base Pay

**Example: E-7 retiring after 20 years**
- High-3 average base pay: $5,000/month
- Calculation: (20 × 2.5%) × $5,000 = 50% × $5,000 = **$2,500/month**
- Annual: $30,000

**Example: O-5 retiring after 25 years**
- High-3 average base pay: $9,000/month
- Calculation: (25 × 2.5%) × $9,000 = 62.5% × $9,000 = **$5,625/month**
- Annual: $67,500

**2. Blended Retirement System (BRS)**
*If you entered on or after Jan 1, 2018, or opted in between 2018-2021*

**Formula:**
> (Years of Service × 2.0%) × Average of Highest 36 Months Base Pay
> PLUS TSP contributions and matching

**Key differences from High-3:**
- 2.0% multiplier (instead of 2.5%)
- Automatic 1% TSP contribution from DOD
- Up to 4% TSP matching
- Continuation pay at 12 years (usually 2.5-13x monthly base pay)
- Lump sum option at retirement

**Example: E-7 retiring after 20 years under BRS**
- High-3 average base pay: $5,000/month
- Calculation: (20 × 2.0%) × $5,000 = 40% × $5,000 = **$2,000/month**
- Plus TSP balance (could be $200K+ with contributions)

**Comparison: High-3 vs. BRS for 20 years**
- High-3: 50% of base pay, no TSP match
- BRS: 40% of base pay, but TSP match can exceed the difference

**3. Redux System (rare)**
*If you entered before Aug 1, 1986 and chose Career Status Bonus*

Similar to High-3 but with penalty for retiring before 30 years. Rarely chosen; most selected High-3 instead.

**How "High-3" is calculated:**

**Not:** Your final base pay
**Instead:** Average of your highest 36 consecutive months of basic pay

**Example:**
- Year 18: $4,800/month average
- Year 19: $5,000/month average
- Year 20: $5,200/month average

High-3 calculation:
> (Year 18 + Year 19 + Year 20) ÷ 3 = ($57,600 + $60,000 + $62,400) ÷ 3 = $180,000 ÷ 36 months = **$5,000/month average**

**Retirement percentages by years of service:**

| Years of Service | High-3 % | BRS % |
|------------------|----------|-------|
| 20 | 50% | 40% |
| 21 | 52.5% | 42% |
| 22 | 55% | 44% |
| 23 | 57.5% | 46% |
| 24 | 60% | 48% |
| 25 | 62.5% | 50% |
| 26 | 65% | 52% |
| 27 | 67.5% | 54% |
| 28 | 70% | 56% |
| 29 | 72.5% | 58% |
| 30 | 75% | 60% |

**What counts as "base pay":**

**Included:**
- Basic pay only

**NOT included in retirement calculation:**
- Housing allowance (BAH)
- Subsistence allowance (BAS)
- Special pays (flight pay, hazardous duty, etc.)
- Bonuses

**This is why retirement income is less than active duty total compensation**

**Example showing the difference:**

*Active duty E-7 total monthly compensation:*
- Base pay: $5,000
- BAH: $2,100
- BAS: $460
- **Total: $7,560/month**

*Retirement (20 years, High-3):*
- Retirement pay: $2,500/month (50% of $5,000 base)
- **Loss of BAH/BAS: -$2,560/month**
- **Effective reduction: ~$5,000/month**

**This is why planning for civilian income is crucial**

**Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs):**

**Retirement pay increases annually** based on Consumer Price Index (CPI):
- Automatic raises each December
- Typically 1-3% per year
- Protects against inflation
- Recent COLAs: 3.2% (2024), 8.7% (2023), 5.9% (2022)

**Example:**
- Retire in 2020 with $2,500/month
- After 4 years of COLAs: ~$2,900/month
- Retirement pay grows over time

**When retirement pay starts:**

**Active duty retirement:**
- Payments begin the first day of the month after retirement
- Example: Retire June 30 → First payment August 1 (for July)

**Reserve retirement:**
- Payments begin at age 60 (unless reduced for active duty service)
- "Gray area" between retirement and pay starting date

**How to estimate your retirement:**

**Option 1: Online calculators**
- Military Pay Calculator: militarypay.defense.gov
- DFAS Retirement Calculator: dfas.mil/retiredmilitary

**Option 2: Manual calculation**
- Find your current base pay or projected base pay at retirement
- Multiply years × 2.5% (High-3) or 2.0% (BRS)
- Multiply result by base pay

**Example projection: E-6 with 15 years, projecting 20-year retirement**

*Current:*
- Base pay: $4,500/month
- Years: 15

*At 20 years (projected):*
- Estimated base pay: $5,000/month (accounting for promotions/pay raises)
- High-3 average: ~$4,900/month
- Retirement: 50% × $4,900 = **$2,450/month** starting at retirement

**Taxes on military retirement:**

**Federal taxes:**
- Military retirement pay is **fully taxable** at federal level
- Treated as ordinary income
- Can withhold taxes from retirement pay

**State taxes:**
- Varies by state (37 states don't tax military retirement)
- See State Benefits FAQ (Q102) for details

**VA disability offset (important):**

**If you have both military retirement and VA disability:**

*Without CRDP/CRSC:*
- VA disability offsets military retirement dollar-for-dollar
- You receive the higher of the two, not both

*With CRDP (Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay):*
- Available if 20+ years AND 50%+ VA rating
- Receive both full military retirement and full VA disability
- No offset

*With CRSC (Combat-Related Special Compensation):*
- Available for combat-related disabilities
- Receive military retirement and CRSC payment equal to VA amount
- CRSC is tax-free

**See Military Retirement FAQ Q011 for more details on CRDP/CRSC**

**Bottom line:**

Military retirement pay is calculated as years of service (minimum 20) × multiplier (2.5% for High-3, 2.0% for BRS) × your average base pay. A 20-year retiree under High-3 receives 50% of base pay for life, with annual COLA increases. Plan for significant income reduction from active duty total compensation (which includes BAH/BAS) to retirement (base pay only), and understand how your retirement interacts with VA disability compensation.
