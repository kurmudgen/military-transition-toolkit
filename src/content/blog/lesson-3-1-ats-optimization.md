### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Module 3 - Structure and Optimization / Lesson 3.1 - ATS Optimization]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to Module 3! Your resume bullets are now powerful, quantified, and jargon-free. But here's the harsh truth: if your resume doesn't make it past the Applicant Tracking System, no human will ever see those great accomplishments you've written.

**[ON SCREEN: "75% of Resumes Are Rejected by ATS Before Reaching Humans"]**

Studies show that 75% of resumes get filtered out by ATS software before a hiring manager ever sees them. For military resumes, that number is even higher because of the jargon and formatting issues we've already discussed.

In this lesson, I'm going to show you exactly how ATS systems work, what they're looking for, and how to optimize your resume to beat the robots and get your resume in front of an actual person.

Let's get started.

---

### PART 1: HOW ATS SYSTEMS WORK (0:30-3:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "What Is an Applicant Tracking System?"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
An Applicant Tracking System - ATS - is software that companies use to manage job applications. It does three main things:

**[ON SCREEN: Three ATS functions with icons]**

**FUNCTION 1: PARSING**
The ATS scans your resume and tries to extract information into categories:
- Contact information
- Work experience
- Education
- Skills
- Dates of employment

If your resume has weird formatting, the ATS can't parse it correctly. Your carefully written bullets might end up in the wrong section or get lost entirely.

**FUNCTION 2: KEYWORD MATCHING**
The ATS searches your resume for specific keywords from the job posting. It's looking for:
- Job titles
- Technical skills
- Software/tools
- Industry terminology
- Required qualifications

If your resume doesn't include the right keywords, it gets a low match score and gets filtered out.

**FUNCTION 3: RANKING AND FILTERING**
Based on the parsing and keyword matching, the ATS assigns your resume a score (usually 1-100). Only the highest-scoring resumes - often just the top 10-20% - make it to a human recruiter.

**[ON SCREEN: Resume → ATS Scan → Score → Filter → Human (or Rejected)]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's what this means for you: you're not just competing with other candidates. You're first competing with a computer algorithm. If you don't optimize for the ATS, you're out of the running before the race even starts.

Let me show you real examples of what goes wrong:

**[ON SCREEN: ATS Parsing Fail Example]**

**WHAT YOU WROTE:**
[Resume with tables and columns]
"EXPERIENCE" in one column, "EDUCATION" in another

**WHAT THE ATS SEES:**
Gibberish. It can't read tables properly, so all your content gets jumbled together or lost.

**RESULT:** Low score, automatic rejection.

**[ON SCREEN: ATS Keyword Fail Example]**

**JOB POSTING KEYWORDS:**
"Project Manager," "Budget Management," "Stakeholder Communication," "Risk Assessment"

**YOUR RESUME SAYS:**
"Platoon Leader," "Resource Allocation," "Coalition Coordination," "Threat Assessment"

**WHAT THE ATS SEES:**
Zero keyword matches, even though you did exactly what they're looking for.

**RESULT:** Low score, automatic rejection.

### PART 2: ATS-FRIENDLY FORMATTING RULES (3:30-7:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "The 10 ATS Formatting Rules"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now let me give you the specific formatting rules you must follow to ensure your resume can be read by ATS systems.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 1 - File Format]**

**RULE 1: FILE FORMAT**

✅ Use .docx (Microsoft Word) as your primary format
✅ PDF is acceptable ONLY if the job posting specifically allows it
❌ Never use: .pages, .txt, Google Docs native format

Why? Most ATS systems read .docx files best. Some modern ATS can read PDFs, but older systems can't. When in doubt, use .docx.

Exception: If you're emailing your resume directly to a person (not applying through an ATS), PDF is fine and actually preferred because it preserves formatting.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 2 - Fonts]**

**RULE 2: STANDARD FONTS ONLY**

✅ Use: Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman, Helvetica
❌ Avoid: Fancy fonts, script fonts, creative fonts

Why? ATS software can't read unusual fonts. Stick to standard, professional fonts.

Font size: 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for your name

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 3 - Layout]**

**RULE 3: SIMPLE, SINGLE-COLUMN LAYOUT**

✅ Use: Single column, top-to-bottom layout
❌ Avoid: Multiple columns, tables, text boxes

Why? ATS reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Multiple columns confuse the parsing algorithm.

**[ON SCREEN: Side-by-side comparison - Bad layout with columns vs. Good single-column layout]**

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 4 - Section Headers]**

**RULE 4: STANDARD SECTION HEADERS**

✅ Use standard header names:
- "Work Experience" or "Professional Experience" (not "Where I've Worked")
- "Education" (not "Academic Background")
- "Skills" (not "Core Competencies" - though this is usually okay)
- "Certifications" (not "Professional Development")

Why? ATS looks for standard section names. Creative headers confuse it.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 5 - Dates]**

**RULE 5: CONSISTENT DATE FORMATTING**

✅ Use: MM/YYYY or Month YYYY format
- Examples: "01/2020 - 12/2023" or "January 2020 - December 2023"
✅ Spell out "Present" for current roles (not "Pres." or "Curr.")
❌ Avoid: Inconsistent formats or abbreviations

Why? ATS tries to calculate your years of experience. Inconsistent dates break the algorithm.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 6 - Bullet Points]**

**RULE 6: SIMPLE BULLET POINTS**

✅ Use: Standard round bullets (•) or simple dashes (-)
❌ Avoid: Fancy symbols (✓, ★, ➢) or images

Why? ATS can't read special characters or image bullets.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 7 - No Headers/Footers]**

**RULE 7: AVOID HEADERS AND FOOTERS**

✅ Put contact info at the top of the page in the main document
❌ Don't put contact info in the header/footer section

Why? Many ATS systems can't read headers and footers, so your contact information gets lost.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 8 - No Graphics]**

**RULE 8: NO GRAPHICS, IMAGES, OR CHARTS**

✅ Text only
❌ No photos, logos, graphs, charts, skill bars, or visual elements

Why? ATS can't read images. They just show up as blank space.

This means:
- No headshot photo (unless specifically requested, which is rare in US)
- No company logos
- No skill level graphics (5 stars for "Microsoft Excel")
- No charts showing your experience

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 9 - Spelling]**

**RULE 9: PERFECT SPELLING AND GRAMMAR**

ATS does spell-check. A misspelled keyword won't match.

"Project Managment" ≠ "Project Management"
"Leaderhsip" ≠ "Leadership"

Proofread multiple times. Use spell-check. Have someone else review.

**[ON SCREEN: Rule 10 - Save As]**

**RULE 10: FILENAME**

✅ Use: FirstName_LastName_Resume.docx
✅ Also acceptable: FirstName_LastName_JobTitle.docx

❌ Avoid: "Resume.docx" or "MyResume_Final_FINAL_v3.docx"

Why? Recruiter sanity. They download dozens of resumes per day. Make yours easy to identify.

### PART 3: KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY (7:00-10:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Find and Use the Right Keywords"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now that your formatting is ATS-friendly, let's talk about keywords - the single most important factor in ATS ranking.

**[ON SCREEN: Step 1 - Analyze the Job Posting]**

**STEP 1: ANALYZE THE JOB POSTING**

Print out or copy the job posting into a document. Then:

1. Highlight all required skills and qualifications
2. Highlight all desired/preferred skills
3. Note repeated terms (if they mention "project management" 5 times, it's important)
4. Identify industry-specific terminology

**[ON SCREEN: Example job posting with keywords highlighted]**

**EXAMPLE JOB POSTING ANALYSIS:**

"We're seeking a Project Manager with 5+ years experience in logistics operations. Responsibilities include budget management, stakeholder communication, risk assessment, and process improvement. Must have experience with supply chain management and vendor relations. PMP certification preferred."

**KEYWORDS IDENTIFIED:**
- Project Manager (job title)
- Logistics operations
- Budget management
- Stakeholder communication
- Risk assessment
- Process improvement
- Supply chain management
- Vendor relations
- PMP certification

**[ON SCREEN: Step 2 - Match Your Experience]**

**STEP 2: MATCH YOUR EXPERIENCE TO KEYWORDS**

Go through your 20 accomplishments and identify where you did these things, even if you called them something different.

**MILITARY EXPERIENCE:**
- "Platoon Leader" → "Project Manager" (in context)
- "Resource allocation" → "Budget management"
- "Coalition coordination" → "Stakeholder communication"
- "Threat assessment" → "Risk assessment"
- "Supply operations" → "Supply chain management"

**[ON SCREEN: Step 3 - Incorporate Keywords Naturally]**

**STEP 3: INCORPORATE KEYWORDS NATURALLY**

Don't just list keywords - incorporate them naturally into your accomplishment statements.

❌ WRONG (keyword stuffing):
"Project Manager, logistics operations, budget management, stakeholder communication, risk assessment"

✅ RIGHT (natural incorporation):
"Managed complex logistics operations coordinating 12-person team, $2.3M annual budget, and stakeholder communication across 6 organizational partners while conducting ongoing risk assessments"

**[ON SCREEN: Step 4 - Create a Skills Section]**

**STEP 4: CREATE A CORE SKILLS SECTION**

After your summary (if you have one) and before your work experience, add a "Core Skills" or "Key Skills" section with 12-20 relevant keywords.

**EXAMPLE:**

**CORE SKILLS:**
Project Management | Budget Management | Logistics Operations | Supply Chain Management | Risk Assessment | Process Improvement | Stakeholder Communication | Team Leadership | Vendor Relations | Performance Management | Strategic Planning | Quality Assurance

**[ON SCREEN: "Use the exact phrasing from the job posting"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's a critical tip: use the EXACT phrasing from the job posting when possible.

If they say "budget management," use "budget management" (not "fiscal oversight")
If they say "project manager," use "project manager" (not "program coordinator")

The ATS is looking for exact matches.

**[ON SCREEN: Step 5 - Use Variations]**

**STEP 5: USE VARIATIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE**

Some skills have multiple common names. Include variations:

- "PMP" AND "Project Management Professional" (spell out acronyms)
- "Budget management" AND "fiscal management"
- "MS Office" AND "Microsoft Office" AND specific apps: "Excel, Word, PowerPoint"

**[ON SCREEN: What NOT to do]**

**KEYWORD STUFFING - DON'T DO THIS:**

Some people try to trick the ATS by:
- Adding white text with keywords (ATS sees this, and it's fraud)
- Listing every possible keyword regardless of actual experience (lying)
- Creating a "keyword dump" section that's nonsensical

Don't do any of these. They're unethical and often detected by modern ATS systems.

Only include keywords for skills you actually have.

### PART 4: ATS-FRIENDLY RESUME STRUCTURE (10:30-13:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Optimal ATS Resume Structure"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now let me show you the exact structure your resume should follow for maximum ATS compatibility.

**[ON SCREEN: Resume structure diagram]**

**SECTION 1: HEADER (Contact Information)**
- Full Name (larger font, 16-18pt)
- Phone number
- Email address (professional: firstname.lastname@email.com)
- LinkedIn URL (customize your LinkedIn URL)
- City, State (optional - some omit for privacy)

DO NOT include:
- Full street address (not necessary, privacy concern)
- Photo (not used in US hiring)
- Age, marital status, or other personal info

**SECTION 2: PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY (Optional but Recommended)**
- 3-4 sentence paragraph or 4-5 bullet points
- Include job title you're targeting, years of experience, key skills
- Incorporate 5-8 keywords from the job posting

**EXAMPLE:**
"Operations Manager with 12+ years leadership experience in logistics, supply chain management, and team development. Proven track record in budget management ($5M+), process improvement, and stakeholder coordination. Expertise in risk assessment, vendor relations, and quality assurance. Security clearance: Secret."

**SECTION 3: CORE SKILLS**
- 12-20 relevant keywords in 2-3 columns or separated by |
- Mix of hard skills (technical) and soft skills (leadership)
- Match job posting keywords

**SECTION 4: PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**
- Reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- Format for each role:

**JOB TITLE | EMPLOYER**
Month YYYY - Month YYYY (or Present)

- 4-6 accomplishment bullets per role
- Use your optimized bullets from Modules 1-2
- Most recent/relevant roles get more bullets
- Older/less relevant roles can have 2-3 bullets

**SECTION 5: EDUCATION**
- Degree, Major, University Name, Graduation Year
- Include relevant coursework if recent graduate
- Include honors if applicable (cum laude, Dean's List)

**SECTION 6: CERTIFICATIONS (if applicable)**
- Certification Name, Issuing Organization, Date
- Include security clearances here

**SECTION 7: MILITARY SERVICE (Optional)**
- Branch, Rank, Years of Service, Honorable Discharge
- Major awards (if relevant and impressive)
- Keep this brief - your skills are in the Experience section

**[ON SCREEN: Length Guidelines]**

**LENGTH:**
- E5-E6 with <15 years experience: 1 page (ideal) or 2 pages (acceptable)
- E7-E9 with 15+ years experience: 2 pages

If you absolutely must go to 2 pages, make sure your strongest content is on page 1. Many recruiters don't look at page 2.

### PART 5: TESTING YOUR ATS COMPATIBILITY (13:30-14:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Test Your Resume"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Before you submit your resume, test it to make sure it's ATS-compatible.

**TEST 1: THE COPY-PASTE TEST**

1. Save your resume as a .txt file
2. Open the .txt file
3. Check if all content is readable and in the right order

If your resume is a mess in .txt format, the ATS probably can't read it properly either.

**TEST 2: FREE ATS SCANNERS**

Use free online tools to scan your resume:
- Jobscan.co (compare your resume to a job posting)
- Resume Worded (free ATS scan)
- TopResume (free ATS review)

These tools show you:
- ATS compatibility score
- Missing keywords
- Formatting issues

**TEST 3: KEYWORD MATCH CHECK**

1. Copy the job posting into a word cloud generator
2. See which words appear most frequently
3. Make sure those words appear in your resume

**TEST 4: THE HUMAN TEST**

After optimizing for ATS, have a human read it. Your resume still needs to be compelling to the hiring manager who eventually sees it.

ATS gets you in the door. Your compelling content gets you the interview.
