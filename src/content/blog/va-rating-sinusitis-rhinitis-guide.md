# VA Rating for Sinusitis and Rhinitis: Compensation Guide (2025)

Chronic sinus problems affect thousands of veterans—and thanks to the PACT Act, getting service connection for sinusitis and rhinitis is easier than ever. If you deployed to areas with burn pits or served in dusty, polluted environments, your sinus condition may be presumptively service-connected.

This guide covers everything you need to know about VA ratings for sinus conditions.

## How the VA Rates Sinus Conditions

### Sinusitis Ratings (DC 6510-6514)

Sinusitis covers inflammation of the sinuses, rated by location:
- DC 6510: Pansinusitis (all sinuses)
- DC 6511: Ethmoid sinusitis
- DC 6512: Frontal sinusitis
- DC 6513: Maxillary sinusitis
- DC 6514: Sphenoid sinusitis

All are rated under the same criteria:

| Rating | Monthly Pay (2025) | Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **0%** | $0 | Detected by X-ray only |
| **10%** | $175.51 | 1-2 incapacitating episodes per year requiring prolonged (4-6 weeks) antibiotic treatment, OR 3-6 non-incapacitating episodes per year characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting |
| **30%** | $524.31 | 3+ incapacitating episodes per year requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment, OR more than 6 non-incapacitating episodes per year |
| **50%** | $1,110.55 | Following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, OR near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, tenderness, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries |

**Incapacitating episode**: Requires bed rest and treatment by physician

**Non-incapacitating episode**: Symptomatic but doesn't require bed rest

### Rhinitis Ratings (DC 6522-6524)

Rhinitis covers nasal inflammation:
- DC 6522: Allergic or vasomotor rhinitis
- DC 6523: Bacterial rhinitis
- DC 6524: Granulomatous rhinitis

**Allergic/Vasomotor Rhinitis (DC 6522):**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Diagnosed but no significant symptoms |
| **10%** | Without polyps, but with greater than 50% obstruction of nasal passages on both sides OR complete obstruction on one side |
| **30%** | With polyps |

**Bacterial Rhinitis (DC 6523):**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Rhinoscleroma (nasal tissue hardening) |
| **50%** | Ozena (chronic atrophic rhinitis with foul-smelling crusts) |

### Key Points

- Sinusitis and rhinitis can be rated separately—they're different conditions
- Maximum sinusitis rating is 50%
- Maximum allergic rhinitis rating is 30%
- If you have both, you can receive combined ratings

## The PACT Act and Sinus Conditions

The PACT Act (2022) is a game-changer for veterans with sinus conditions. If you served in certain locations, sinusitis and rhinitis are now presumptively service-connected.

### Presumptive Service Connection

**If you served in these locations, you don't need to prove a nexus:**

**Southwest Asia** (on or after August 2, 1990):
- Iraq
- Kuwait
- Saudi Arabia
- Bahrain
- Qatar
- UAE
- Oman
- Gulf of Aden
- Gulf of Oman
- Persian Gulf
- Arabian Sea
- Red Sea

**Afghanistan** (on or after September 19, 2001)

**Other locations** (on or after September 11, 2001):
- Djibouti
- Egypt
- Jordan
- Lebanon
- Syria
- Yemen
- Uzbekistan
- Somalia

### Presumptive Conditions Under PACT Act

The following respiratory conditions are presumptive for covered veterans:
- Asthma diagnosed after service
- Rhinitis
- Sinusitis
- Constrictive bronchiolitis
- And more

**What presumptive means**: You don't need a nexus letter. If you have the diagnosis and served in a covered location, service connection is presumed.

## Burn Pit Exposure and Sinus Problems

### How Burn Pits Cause Sinus Conditions

Burn pits released toxic smoke containing:
- Jet fuel
- Plastics
- Rubber
- Medical waste
- Human waste
- Chemicals
- Metals

This smoke directly damaged respiratory tissues, including sinuses.

### Documenting Burn Pit Exposure

Even with PACT Act presumptives, documenting exposure strengthens your claim:

1. **Service records showing deployment location**
2. **Burn Pit Registry enrollment** (through VA)
3. **Unit records or photos** showing burn pit operations
4. **Buddy statements** describing exposure
5. **Air quality data** from deployment area

### Non-PACT Act Burn Pit Claims

If your service doesn't fall under PACT Act presumptives, you can still claim burn pit-related sinusitis:

1. Document your exposure
2. Get diagnosis of sinusitis/rhinitis
3. Obtain nexus letter connecting condition to exposure
4. File direct service connection claim

## Proving Service Connection

### For PACT Act Veterans (Easiest Path)

1. Confirm you served in covered location during covered dates
2. Get current diagnosis of sinusitis or rhinitis
3. File claim—no nexus needed
4. VA will verify deployment and diagnosis

### For Non-PACT Act Veterans

**Direct service connection requires:**
1. Current diagnosis
2. In-service event, injury, or condition
3. Medical nexus

**In-service evidence:**
- Sick call visits for sinus problems
- Allergy treatment during service
- Documentation of dusty/polluted environments
- Unit records of environmental hazards
- Buddy statements about conditions

**Common in-service causes:**
- Dusty training environments (desert, sandy areas)
- Chemical/biological exposure
- Smoke from weapons, vehicles, or fires
- Mold in barracks
- Contaminated water (some bases)
- Close living quarters (increased infection risk)

### Secondary Service Connection

Sinus conditions can be secondary to:

**PTSD/Anxiety → Rhinitis**
- Stress affects immune function
- Can worsen allergic responses

**Sleep Apnea → Sinusitis**
- CPAP use can contribute to sinus problems
- Positive pressure affects sinuses

**Deviated Septum → Sinusitis**
- If septum deviation is service-connected
- Structural problem leads to chronic sinusitis

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Current diagnosis** from ENT or primary care
2. **Imaging** (CT sinus scan shows inflammation, blockages)
3. **Treatment records**:
   - Antibiotic prescriptions
   - Steroid treatments
   - Nasal spray prescriptions
   - Sinus surgery records
4. **Episode documentation** (dates, severity, treatment)

### For PACT Act Claims

5. **DD-214** or service records showing qualifying deployment
6. **Deployment orders**
7. **Burn Pit Registry enrollment** (helpful, not required)

### Lay Evidence

8. **Personal statement** describing:
   - When symptoms started
   - Environmental exposures during service
   - Frequency of sinus infections/episodes
   - Impact on daily life

9. **Buddy statements** describing:
   - Environmental conditions during service
   - Your visible symptoms (congestion, breathing difficulty)
   - Frequency of illness

## C&P Exam for Sinus Conditions

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about symptom history
3. Examine nasal passages
4. Review imaging studies
5. Count incapacitating and non-incapacitating episodes
6. Provide nexus opinion (for non-PACT claims)

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- When did your sinus problems start?
- How many sinus infections do you get per year?
- How long do episodes last?
- What treatment do you receive?
- Have you had sinus surgery?
- What are your current symptoms?
- Where did you serve? (PACT Act relevance)

### How to Answer

**Count your episodes**:
- Keep a symptom diary before the exam
- Include both "bad enough to see doctor" and "stayed home but didn't go to doctor"
- Be honest but thorough

**Describe symptoms clearly**:
- "I have chronic congestion 80% of the time"
- "I get severe sinus headaches about twice a month"
- "I've been on antibiotics 4 times this year for sinus infections"

**Mention environmental exposures**:
- "I was stationed at [base] where we had burn pits operating 24/7"
- "Our unit breathed in smoke and dust constantly"

### What to Bring

- List of all sinus medications (current and past)
- Records of antibiotic treatments
- CT scan results if available
- Notes on episode frequency
- Photos from deployment showing environmental conditions

## Sinusitis Secondary Conditions

If your sinusitis is service-connected, consider claiming:

### Sleep Apnea
- Sinus congestion contributes to airway obstruction
- Strong medical connection
- Rated 0-100%

### Headaches/Migraines
- Sinus headaches can become chronic migraines
- Rated 0-50%

### Deviated Septum
- Chronic inflammation can worsen structural problems
- May require surgery

### Dental Conditions
- Maxillary sinusitis affects upper teeth
- May qualify for VA dental coverage

### Depression/Anxiety
- Chronic illness affects mental health
- Especially with sleep disruption

## Rhinitis Secondary Conditions

If your rhinitis is service-connected:

### Sinusitis
- Chronic rhinitis leads to sinus infections
- Very common progression

### Sleep Apnea
- Nasal obstruction contributes to apnea
- File as secondary

### Asthma
- Allergic rhinitis and asthma often coexist
- United airway disease concept

## Common Denial Reasons and Solutions

### "Condition existed before service"
**Solution**: If condition worsened during service, file aggravation claim with medical evidence showing progression.

### "No current diagnosis"
**Solution**: Get ENT evaluation with CT sinus scan to document current condition.

### "Episodes don't meet criteria"
**Solution**: Document all episodes, including those not severe enough to see doctor. Buddy statements help.

### "Not enough evidence of in-service causation"
**Solution**: For PACT Act claims, verify deployment records. For others, get nexus letter explaining environmental connection.

## Maximizing Your Sinus Rating

### Tips for Higher Rating

1. **Track every episode** - Keep a symptom diary
2. **Document antibiotic treatments** - Save pharmacy records
3. **Get CT scan** - Shows severity of inflammation
4. **See specialist** - ENT evaluation carries weight
5. **File sinusitis AND rhinitis** - If you have both
6. **Claim secondary conditions** - Sleep apnea especially

### 30% vs 10% for Sinusitis

The difference between 10% and 30% is:
- **10%**: 3-6 non-incapacitating episodes per year
- **30%**: More than 6 non-incapacitating episodes per year

If you're borderline, document every episode carefully. Many veterans undercount their episodes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a nexus letter if I'm a PACT Act veteran?
No. Presumptive conditions under PACT Act don't require nexus. You need diagnosis + qualifying service.

### Can I claim both sinusitis and rhinitis?
Yes. They're different conditions rated under different diagnostic codes. You can receive ratings for both.

### What if my sinus condition developed years after service?
If you qualify under PACT Act, timing doesn't matter for presumptive conditions. For non-PACT claims, you'll need nexus evidence.

### Should I enroll in the Burn Pit Registry?
Yes. It documents your exposure and can support your claim, though it's not required for PACT Act claims.

### What's the average sinus rating?
Most veterans receive 10% for sinusitis. Getting 30% requires documenting 6+ episodes per year.

### Can allergies be service-connected?
Yes. Allergic rhinitis can be service-connected if it began or worsened during service or as secondary to environmental exposures.

## 2025 Compensation Rates

| Rating | Veteran Alone | With Spouse | With Spouse + Child |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 10% | $175.51 | $175.51 | $175.51 |

## Bottom Line

The PACT Act has made sinus claims much easier for veterans who served in covered locations. If you deployed to Southwest Asia, Afghanistan, or other qualifying areas, your sinusitis and rhinitis may be presumptively service-connected.

Key steps:
1. Verify you qualify for PACT Act presumptives
2. Get diagnosed by ENT if not already
3. Track your episodes carefully
4. File for both sinusitis AND rhinitis if you have both
5. Claim secondary conditions (sleep apnea is huge)

Stop suffering with chronic sinus problems without compensation.
