# 15P Aviation Operations Specialist to Operations Manager: Your Complete Transition Guide

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Army 15P Aviation Operations Specialists transition successfully to civilian Operations Manager roles, leveraging comprehensive aviation operations and logistics expertise. Operations Managers earn a median salary of $104,440 annually (BLS), with 8% job growth through 2032. Your military background in aviation scheduling, maintenance coordination, safety protocols, and resource management directly translates to high-value operational leadership. The transition typically requires minimal additional certification, though advancing management education accelerates advancement to director and VP roles earning $130,000+. Most 15Ps transition to civilian operations roles within 3-6 months.

## Career Overview: From Military Aviation Operations to Civilian Leadership

As a 15P Aviation Operations Specialist, you've developed comprehensive operational expertise:

- Flight schedule management and optimization

- Aircraft utilization and performance tracking
- Safety protocols and compliance management
- Airfield operations and ground support coordination
- Logistics and supply chain coordination
- Multi-million-dollar budget management

Civilian operations roles leverage these exact skills while expanding into strategic operational improvement, business analysis, and executive leadership opportunities unavailable in military settings.
