# Military to Homeland Security: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and related homeland security careers offer veterans diverse opportunities with starting salaries of $45,000-$75,000 and senior positions earning $100,000-$150,000+. As the third-largest federal department with 240,000+ employees, DHS actively recruits veterans for roles from border security to cybersecurity to emergency management. Your military experience, security clearances, and understanding of national security translate directly. Veterans receive hiring preference, and many DHS components have specific veteran recruitment programs. Most positions can be entered within 3-9 months.

## Why Veterans Excel in Homeland Security

Military service is homeland security. You've protected the nation, secured borders, responded to threats, and worked within large security organizations—exactly what DHS does.

Your understanding of threats and security operations exceeds civilian candidates. Whether counterterrorism, border security, or critical infrastructure protection, you've worked on these issues.

Security clearances open doors across DHS. Many positions require clearances that you already hold.

Physical fitness and tactical skills support law enforcement roles within DHS. CBP, ICE, Secret Service, and other components need operationally capable personnel.

Emergency management experience from military service translates to FEMA and other disaster response roles. You've operated in crisis environments.

Your discipline and ability to work within large bureaucracies aligns with federal government culture at DHS.
