# VA Rating for Knee Pain: Compensation and Rating Guide

Knee injuries represent among the most common service-connected musculoskeletal disabilities for veterans. Whether from combat operations, training injuries, or military occupational demands, knee pain affects work capacity and quality of life. Many veterans don't realize that knee conditions receive VA disability ratings ranging from 10% to 100%, with monthly compensation based on severity and functional impact.

## Understanding Knee Conditions in Military Service

The VA recognizes various knee conditions as service-connected:

**Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears** - Most common knee injury in military personnel. ACL tears from jumping, rapid direction changes, or trauma significantly impair knee stability and function.

**Meniscal Tears** - Cartilage damage affecting knee mechanics. Can develop from acute injury or degenerative changes over years of service.

**Osteoarthritis of the Knee** - Degenerative joint disease from wear-and-tear during military service. More common in those with prior injuries or high-impact occupations.

**Medial/Lateral Collateral Ligament Injuries (MCL/LCL)** - Side ligament tears from lateral impact or twisting injuries.

**Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome** - Damage to cartilage behind kneecap; common in runners and those with repetitive impact duties.

**Chondromalacia Patella** - Cartilage softening under the kneecap causing pain with activity.

**Post-Traumatic Arthritis** - Joint disease developing after injury, often years later.

Military occupations with high knee injury rates:
- Infantry and combat roles (high impact, heavy load carrying)
- Airborne/Ranger training (jumping operations)
- Physical training instructors
- Combat support roles requiring extended patrols
- Aviation personnel (ejection seat injuries)

## VA Rating System for Knee Conditions

The VA uses multiple diagnostic codes for knee disability, rating on functional limitation rather than diagnosis alone. Key codes include:

**DC 5003 - Arthritis, Hypertrophic**
**DC 5020 - Knee, Instability**
**DC 5099 - Knee, Other Conditions**

### Rating Criteria

The VA's 2019 Schedule for Rating Disabilities uses the following criteria for knee ratings:

**0% (Not Rated)** - No functional limitation or occasional mild pain without restriction

**10% Rating** - Slight functional limitation:
- Occasional pain with strenuous activity
- No swelling or instability documented
- Full range of motion maintained
- Minimal medication needed
- No work restriction

**20% Rating** - Mild functional limitation:
- Pain with moderate activity
- Slight swelling or occasional instability
- Near-normal range of motion
- Occasional medication
- Minimal work restrictions

**30% Rating** - Moderate functional limitation:
- Pain with everyday activities and rest
- Documented swelling or instability
- Limited range of motion (10-20% limitation)
- Regular pain medication
- Some work restrictions (can't stand 8 hours daily)

**40% Rating** - Moderately severe functional limitation:
- Significant pain throughout day
- Marked swelling or instability
- Range of motion 20-40% limited
- Multiple medications or other treatments
- Cannot perform occupational duties without limitation

**50% Rating** - Severe functional limitation:
- Constant pain even at rest
- Severe swelling and instability
- Range of motion 40-60% limited
- Requires multiple treatment modalities
- Unable to work in occupational field

**60%-100% Rating** - Very severe to total disability:
- Severe functional limitation affecting employment
- May require surgery or special footwear
- Often combined with other conditions
- 100% typically via TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability)

### Factors Determining Rating Percentage

The VA considers:
1. **Pain severity** - Mild, moderate, or severe
2. **Functional limitation** - Impact on standing, walking, climbing
3. **Range of motion** - How much knee can bend/straighten
4. **Stability** - Evidence of ligament damage causing instability
5. **Swelling** - Degree of edema present
6. **Treatment status** - Medications, physical therapy, surgery
7. **Work capacity** - Ability to perform occupational duties

## Monthly Compensation for Knee Conditions

Monthly compensation varies by rating percentage and dependent status. As of 2025:

**10% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $175-$185/month
- With spouse: $195-$210/month
- With child: $210-$230/month

**20% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $253-$270/month

## C&P Exam Preparation for Knee Claims

The VA frequently schedules C&P exams for knee disability claims. Thorough preparation improves your rating chance.

### Exam Components

**Medical History**: Detailed knee injury history and development

**Imaging Review**: Examiner reviews available MRI, X-rays, CT scans

**Physical Examination**:
- Visual inspection for swelling, skin changes
- Range of motion testing (flexion/extension measurements)
- Stability testing (ACL, MCL, PCL tests)
- Strength testing
- Gait assessment

**Functional Assessment**:
- Can you stand for extended periods?
- Can you walk up/down stairs?
- Can you kneel or squat?
- What activities increase pain?

### Key Questions During C&P Exam

- When did the knee injury occur and how?
- What specific activities cause pain?
- How far can you walk before pain becomes limiting?
- Can you stand all day for work?
- Do you have swelling or instability episodes?
- What medications do you take for pain?
- Have you had surgery on this knee?
- How has the knee affected your occupational duties?
- Do you use any assistive devices (brace, cane)?

### Preparation Tips

- **Bring Imaging**: Provide copies of all MRI, X-ray, and CT reports
- **Wear Appropriate Clothing**: Wear shorts so examiner can inspect knee fully
- **Document Functional Impact**: Prepare specific examples: "I can't stand more than 30 minutes," "Climbing stairs causes severe pain"
- **Medication List**: Bring list of all pain medications and side effects
- **Treatment History**: Document all physical therapy, injections, or surgeries
- **Occupational Impact**: Be specific about work restrictions needed
- **Be Truthful About Function**: Don't exaggerate, but be honest about limitations
- **Demonstrate Pain**: If pain occurs during exam movements, show it; don't try to hide it

The examiner will perform standardized tests and compare your results to normal values to determine functional limitation percentage.

## Real Claim Examples

### Case 1: ACL Tear from Combat

A former Army infantryman suffered ACL tear during combat patrol. He filed with:
- Military medical records documenting injury
- ACL reconstruction surgery records
- Current MRI showing post-surgical changes
- Orthopedic report documenting 30% range of motion limitation
- Employer statement noting inability to perform field duties

**Outcome**: 40% rating. Combined with 10% back pain = 46% overall. Monthly compensation: $410. Back pay: $6,200.

### Case 2: Degenerative Arthritis from Service

A 20-year military service veteran with multiple patrols and load-carrying duties filed for progressive knee arthritis. Evidence included:
- X-rays showing significant joint space narrowing
- Medical records documenting progressive symptoms over 5 years
- PT notes showing range of motion decrease
- Orthopedic specialist assessment of severe osteoarthritis
- Occupational restrictions preventing field duties

**Outcome**: 50% rating. Combined with 20% lower back pain = 60% overall. Monthly compensation: $825.

### Case 3: Meniscal Tears from Training

A former Ranger with repeated meniscal tears from jump training filed disability claim with:
- Military training records showing airborne operations
- Arthroscopy reports documenting meniscal damage
- PT records showing ongoing pain and instability
- Functional limitation statement from current employer
- Medical opinion on service-connection

**Outcome**: 30% rating. Monthly compensation: $350.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: No Imaging Evidence
Filing without X-rays or MRI significantly weakens claims.

**Solution**: Obtain imaging from VA or civilian provider before filing.

### Mistake 2: Vague Functional Impact Description
Simply saying "my knee hurts" doesn't justify high ratings.

**Solution**: Be specific: "I can't stand more than 2 hours," "Walking more than a quarter mile causes severe pain," "Can't climb stairs without pain."

### Mistake 3: Missing Orthopedic Evaluation
Filing without specialist assessment weakens moderate-to-severe rating claims.

**Solution**: See VA or civilian orthopedic specialist before filing for 40%+ ratings.

### Mistake 4: Poor Nexus Letter Quality
Weak medical nexus reduces approval chances.

**Solution**: Work with experienced nexus letter providers; ensure letter explicitly connects service to current condition.

### Mistake 5: No Treatment Documentation
Failing to show ongoing treatment suggests minor condition.

**Solution**: Continue physical therapy or relevant treatments; document all treatment attempts.

## Secondary Conditions from Knee Injuries

Veterans with severe knee injuries commonly develop secondary conditions:

**Hip Pain (10-50% rating)** - Altered gait overloading hip joint

**Back Pain (10-100% rating)** - Compensation patterns affecting spine

**Other Knee (10-100% rating)** - Overuse injury to opposite leg

**Depression/Anxiety (10-100% rating)** - Chronic pain effects on mental health

**Sleep Disorder (10-100% rating)** - Pain disrupting sleep

Filing secondary conditions increases total compensation through combined ratings.

## Conclusion

Knee disability claims are highly approvable with proper medical evidence and documentation of functional limitation. The key to maximizing your rating is obtaining comprehensive imaging, specialist evaluation, and a strong nexus letter connecting your condition to military service.

Start your claim through VA.gov, your VA Regional Office, or with a veterans' service organization. The earlier your effective date, the more back pay you'll receive. With persistence and proper documentation, most veterans successfully secure knee disability ratings and meaningful monthly compensation for service-connected knee conditions.
