**[ON SCREEN: Lesson 4.2 - Salary Negotiation with Military Background / FINAL LESSON]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to the final lesson of Military Resume Mastery! We've covered resume writing, ATS optimization, LinkedIn, cover letters, and sensitive issues. Now let's talk about money.

**[ON SCREEN: "Your Military Retirement Is Your Secret Weapon in Negotiations"]**

Here's something most transitioning veterans don't realize: your military retirement pay is a massive advantage in salary negotiations. It gives you leverage that civilian candidates don't have.

In this final lesson, I'm going to show you how to research civilian salaries, understand total compensation, negotiate like a pro, and use your military retirement strategically without underselling yourself.

Let's make sure you get paid what you're worth.

### PART 1: UNDERSTANDING CIVILIAN COMPENSATION (0:30-3:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Civilian Compensation Is More Than Just Salary"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
First, you need to understand that civilian compensation is completely different from military pay.

In the military, you have:
- Base pay
- BAH (housing allowance)
- BAS (food allowance)
- Special pays (hazard, flight, dive, etc.)
- Free or low-cost healthcare (TRICARE)
- Pension after 20 years

In the civilian world, it's more complex:

**[ON SCREEN: Components of Civilian Compensation]**

**CIVILIAN TOTAL COMPENSATION INCLUDES:**

**1. BASE SALARY** (the number you negotiate)
- This is your annual gross pay before taxes
- Usually paid bi-weekly or monthly
- This is what most people focus on, but it's not the whole picture

**2. BONUSES**
- Sign-on bonus (one-time payment when you start)
- Annual performance bonus (typically 5-20% of base salary)
- Quarterly bonuses (less common)
- Spot bonuses (for exceptional performance)

**3. EQUITY/STOCK OPTIONS** (larger companies, tech companies)
- RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) - company stock that vests over time
- Stock options - right to buy company stock at set price
- Can be worth 10-30% of total compensation at big tech companies
- Often vests over 4 years

**4. BENEFITS**
- Health insurance (medical, dental, vision)
- 401(k) match (typically 3-6% of salary)
- Life insurance
- Disability insurance (short-term and long-term)
- Paid Time Off (PTO): vacation, sick leave, holidays

**5. PERKS**
- Remote work options
- Flexible schedule
- Professional development budget
- Tuition reimbursement
- Gym membership
- Cell phone/internet reimbursement
- Company car or car allowance

**[ON SCREEN: Example Total Compensation Package]**

**EXAMPLE: OPERATIONS MANAGER OFFER**

**Base Salary:** $85,000
**Annual Bonus (10%):** $8,500
**Sign-on Bonus:** $5,000 (one-time)
**401(k) Match (5%):** $4,250
**Health Insurance Value:** $8,000 (employer portion)
**PTO:** 15 days ($4,900 value)
**TOTAL FIRST YEAR:** $115,650

**TOTAL ONGOING (after year 1):** $105,750/year

### PART 2: RESEARCHING MARKET RATES (3:30-6:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Know Your Worth Before Negotiating"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Before you can negotiate, you need to know what you're worth. Here's how to research market rates.

**[ON SCREEN: Salary Research Tools]**

**SALARY RESEARCH RESOURCES:**

**1. GLASSDOOR.COM**
- Search by job title and location
- See salary ranges reported by actual employees
- Filter by company size and industry

**2. SALARY.COM**

- Includes cost of living adjustments by city

**3. PAYSCALE.COM**
- Fill out detailed questionnaire
- Get personalized salary report
- Shows how years of experience affects pay

**4. LINKEDIN SALARY**

- Defense Contractors: ClearanceJobs.com salary survey

**[ON SCREEN: How to Use Salary Data]**

**HOW TO RESEARCH YOUR TARGET SALARY:**

**STEP 1:** Find 5-10 job postings for your target role in your target location

**STEP 2:** Look up each role on 2-3 salary websites

**STEP 3:** Create your salary range:
- **Low end:** 25th percentile (if you're career changing or early career)
- **Mid-point:** 50th percentile (if you have relevant experience)
- **High end:** 75th percentile (if you're highly qualified with in-demand skills)

**STEP 4:** Adjust for factors:
- **Security clearance:** Add 20-30% if required for role
- **High cost of living area:** Adjust upward (SF, NYC, DC, Seattle)
- **Low cost of living area:** Adjust downward (Midwest, South)
- **In-demand skills:** Add 10-20% (cybersecurity, cloud, specialized tech)
- **Company size:** Large companies typically pay 10-20% more than small

**[ON SCREEN: Example Salary Research]**

**EXAMPLE:**

**Target Role:** Project Manager in Austin, TX
**Base Research:**
- Glassdoor: $75K - $95K
- Salary.com: $78K - $92K
- LinkedIn: $80K - $100K

**Your Range:** $75K (low) - $90K (mid) - $100K (high)

**Adjustments:**
- You have Secret clearance (+$10K): $85K - $100K - $110K
- Austin is medium COL (no adjustment needed)
- 15 years leadership experience (aim for 75th percentile)

**YOUR TARGET: $100K - $110K**

### PART 3: STRATEGIC USE OF MILITARY RETIREMENT (6:00-9:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Use Your Military Retirement in Negotiations"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now here's where it gets interesting. If you're retirement eligible or already receiving military retirement pay, you have leverage that civilian candidates don't have. But you need to use it strategically.

**[ON SCREEN: Three Negotiation Strategies]**

**STRATEGY 1: TOTAL COMPENSATION APPROACH (Recommended)**

**The Concept:**
Your total compensation = Civilian salary + Military retirement + VA disability + Benefits

You can afford to accept a slightly lower salary than a civilian candidate because you have additional income streams.

**Example:**

**Civilian Candidate's Needs:**
- Needs $95K salary to cover all living expenses

**Your Situation:**
- Military retirement: $30K/year
- VA disability: $18K/year (tax-free)
- Total additional income: $48K/year

**Your Calculation:**
You could accept $70K civilian salary and have total income of $118K ($70K + $30K + $18K), which is more than the civilian candidate's $95K.

**[ON SCREEN: "But Should You?"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
BUT - and this is important - just because you CAN accept less doesn't mean you SHOULD.

Your military retirement is compensation you already earned through 20+ years of service. It's not a discount you should give to your civilian employer.

**[ON SCREEN: Strategy 2]**

**STRATEGY 2: FLEXIBILITY APPROACH**

Use your retirement as leverage for non-salary benefits:

**"I'm open to flexibility on base salary if we can discuss [other benefits]."**

What to negotiate for instead of salary:
- More PTO (25-30 days instead of 15)
- Remote work options
- Flexible schedule
- Professional development budget ($5K-$10K/year)
- Faster bonus eligibility
- Stock options or equity
- Sign-on bonus

**Example negotiation:**

"I appreciate the $85K offer. I was hoping for $95K based on my research, but I'm flexible. If we can increase the PTO to 25 days and include a $7,500 professional development budget, I'd be comfortable with $88K."

**[ON SCREEN: Strategy 3]**

**STRATEGY 3: NEGOTIATING POWER APPROACH (Most Powerful)**

Use your retirement as a mental advantage, not a discount:

**The Mindset:**
Because you have retirement income, you DON'T NEED this job as desperately as civilian candidates. You can walk away from a bad offer. This gives you negotiating power.

**How to use it:**

When they give you a low-ball offer, you can confidently say:

"I appreciate the offer of $75K, but based on my research and 15 years of leadership experience, I was expecting $95K-$100K. Is there flexibility in the budget to get closer to that range?"

If they say no, you can walk away. You're not desperate. You have income. This confidence often leads to better offers.

**[ON SCREEN: "Never Mention Your Retirement in Negotiations"]**

**CRITICAL TIP:**

**NEVER SAY:** "Well, I have military retirement, so I can accept less..."

This tanks your negotiating position immediately.

**DO SAY:** "Based on market research and my experience level, I was expecting $95K-$100K. Is there flexibility?"

Keep your retirement in your back pocket as mental security, not as a reason to accept less.

### PART 4: THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS (9:30-12:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Step-by-Step Negotiation Process"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me walk you through the actual negotiation process, step by step.

**[ON SCREEN: Step 1 - Never Give First Number]**

**STEP 1: NEVER GIVE THE FIRST NUMBER (If Possible)**

**Interview Question:** "What are your salary expectations?"

❌ Don't say: "$85,000"

✅ Do say: "I'm looking for a competitive salary based on my 15 years of leadership experience and the market rate for this role in [location]. I'm sure you have a budget in mind for this position. What range are you working with?"

**Deflect back to them. Make them give the first number.**

If they insist:

✅ "Based on my research, similar roles in this area are paying in the $90K-$110K range. Is that in line with your budget for this position?"

Give a range, not a single number. This gives you negotiating room.

**[ON SCREEN: Step 2 - Don't Accept Immediately]**

**STEP 2: NEVER ACCEPT THE FIRST OFFER IMMEDIATELY**

When they make an offer:

❌ Don't say: "Yes! I accept!"

✅ Do say: "Thank you so much for the offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity. I'd like to take 24-48 hours to review the full compensation package and get back to you. Would that work?"

**Always take time to review, even if you love the offer.**

This shows you're thoughtful and gives you time to prepare a counter-offer if needed.

**[ON SCREEN: Step 3 - Evaluate Total Package]**

**STEP 3: EVALUATE THE TOTAL PACKAGE**

Get everything in writing:
- Base salary
- Bonus structure and eligibility
- Health insurance costs (what YOU pay vs. employer pays)
- 401(k) match details
- PTO days
- Start date and notice period required
- Any equity or stock options

Create a spreadsheet comparing:
- This offer
- Your target compensation
- Any other offers you have

**[ON SCREEN: Step 4 - Prepare Your Counter]**

**STEP 4: PREPARE YOUR COUNTER-OFFER (if needed)**

**The Counter-Offer Formula:**

1. **Express enthusiasm**
2. **State your ask**
3. **Provide justification**
4. **Show flexibility**

**Example Counter-Offer:**

"Thank you for the offer of $85K. I'm very excited about the Operations Manager role and the opportunity to contribute to [Company]'s supply chain efficiency initiatives.

Based on my 15 years of leadership experience managing teams up to 45 personnel, my expertise in [key skills], and my research on market rates for this role in [location], I was hoping for a base salary in the $95K-$100K range.

I'm flexible on how we structure the compensation - whether through base salary, sign-on bonus, or performance bonus - and I'm confident I'll deliver strong ROI for the organization.

Is there room in the budget to get closer to the $95K-$100K range?"

**[ON SCREEN: Step 5 - Know When to Walk]**

**STEP 5: KNOW WHEN TO WALK AWAY**

Sometimes, the offer just isn't good enough. You should walk away if:
- Salary is 20%+ below market rate with no flexibility
- Company culture raises red flags
- Role expectations are unrealistic for the pay
- Benefits are significantly worse than standard
- Company is unstable or has bad reputation

**You have military retirement. You can afford to wait for the right opportunity.**

### PART 5: COMMON NEGOTIATION MISTAKES (12:30-14:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Negotiation Mistakes to Avoid"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Before we wrap up, let me show you the most common negotiation mistakes veterans make:

**MISTAKE #1: ACCEPTING FIRST OFFER WITHOUT NEGOTIATING**

Studies show that 76% of employers expect candidates to negotiate, and first offers have built-in room for negotiation.

If you don't negotiate, you leave $5K-$15K on the table, which compounds over your entire career.

**MISTAKE #2: FOCUSING ONLY ON BASE SALARY**

Remember: total compensation matters.

Sometimes getting:
- 5 extra PTO days ($2K value)
- $5K sign-on bonus
- Better 401(k) match
- Remote work flexibility

...is worth more than $3K extra in base salary.

**MISTAKE #3: APOLOGIZING OR SOUNDING UNCERTAIN**

❌ "I'm sorry, but I was hoping for maybe a little more if that's okay..."

✅ "Based on my research and experience, I was expecting $95K-$100K. Is there flexibility?"

Be confident. You've earned it.

**MISTAKE #4: LYING ABOUT OTHER OFFERS**

❌ "I have another offer for $110K" (when you don't)

This will backfire if they call your bluff. Be honest.

✅ "I'm in late-stage discussions with another company" (if true)

**MISTAKE #5: NEGOTIATING BEFORE GETTING WRITTEN OFFER**

Don't negotiate hypotheticals. Wait for the actual written offer, then negotiate.

**MISTAKE #6: ACCEPTING VERBAL OFFER WITHOUT WRITTEN CONFIRMATION**

Always get everything in writing before you:
- Quit your current job
- Turn down other offers
- Tell anyone you got the job

**MISTAKE #7: UNDERSELLING YOURSELF BECAUSE OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

You have 10-20 years of leadership experience managing people, budgets, and high-pressure operations. You ARE qualified. Negotiate accordingly.
