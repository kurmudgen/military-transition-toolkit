# Best Online Degrees for Military Spouses (Fully Remote)

## Bottom Line Up Front

Fully online degrees allow military spouses to complete education regardless of duty station—even OCONUS. The best programs offer **military tuition discounts** (often $250-$350/credit), **transfer-friendly policies**, **flexible scheduling**, and **no residency requirements**. Top military-friendly online universities include Western Governors University, Southern New Hampshire University, Purdue Global, and Arizona State University Online. With transferred GI Bill benefits, military spouse scholarships, and tuition discounts, a degree is more accessible than ever.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Traditional on-campus degrees fail military spouses:
- PCS mid-semester disrupts everything
- Credits may not transfer
- Clinical/lab requirements tied to location
- Residency requirements impossible to meet
- In-state tuition disappears with each move

**Online degrees solve these problems:**
- Complete coursework from any location
- No residency requirements
- Designed for non-traditional students
- Military-friendly transfer policies
- Consistent pricing regardless of state

### Questions to Ask Before Enrolling

1. What is your accreditation? (Must be regional)
2. What is the total cost including all fees?
3. How many credits can transfer from my prior education?
4. Are there any in-person requirements?
5. What is the graduation rate?
6. What career services exist for online students?
7. What is your military spouse support system?

## Success Stories

**Amanda, Army Spouse - Business Degree**
"I started at a community college in Texas, PCS'd to Germany, then to Fort Bragg. I transferred everything to SNHU and finished my BA in Business Administration entirely online while overseas. Graduated while stationed in Germany—never stepped on campus. The degree helped me get a remote job making $55K."

**Marcus, Navy Spouse - IT Degree**
"WGU was perfect. I had some IT certifications already, which counted as transfer credit. The competency-based model let me finish my BS in IT in 18 months instead of 4 years—because I already knew a lot of the material. Cost about $15K total. Now I work remotely in cybersecurity."

**Priya, Air Force Spouse - Nursing**
"BSN was harder because of clinicals. I did Purdue Global's nursing program. They have clinical placement services that found me sites at three different duty stations. Yes, I had to adjust when we PCS'd, but they worked with me. Graduated, got compact license, now do telehealth nursing remotely."
