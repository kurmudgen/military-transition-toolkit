# Bursitis Secondary to Joint Injury: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Often develops from joint conditions
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-20%
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected joint condition, bursitis diagnosis, documentation of progression, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Moderate to High (60-75%) with clear documentation

Bursitis commonly develops secondary to joint injuries and conditions due to inflammation, compensatory movements, and mechanical changes. If you have a service-connected joint condition that has led to bursitis, you have grounds for a secondary claim.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For bursitis secondary to joint conditions:
- Your original joint condition must be service-connected
- Bursitis must be diagnosed
- The joint condition must have caused or worsened the bursitis

## What Is Bursitis?

### Anatomy

Bursae are small fluid-filled sacs that:
- Cushion bones, tendons, and muscles
- Reduce friction during movement
- Located throughout the body near joints

### Common Bursae Affected

**Shoulder:**
- Subacromial bursa (most common)
- Subdeltoid bursa
- Subscapular bursa

**Hip:**
- Trochanteric bursa (very common)
- Iliopsoas bursa
- Ischial bursa

**Knee:**
- Prepatellar bursa ("housemaid's knee")
- Infrapatellar bursa
- Pes anserine bursa

**Elbow:**
- Olecranon bursa

**Other:**
- Retrocalcaneal (heel)
- Ischial (buttock)

### Symptoms

**Classic Presentation:**
- Localized pain and tenderness
- Swelling over bursa
- Warmth and redness
- Pain with movement
- Limited range of motion
- Pain worse with direct pressure

## How Joint Conditions Cause Bursitis

### Direct Inflammation Spread

**Mechanism:**
- Joint inflammation affects nearby bursa
- Arthritis leads to bursal irritation
- Shared anatomical space

**Example:**
- Shoulder arthritis → Subacromial bursitis
- Hip arthritis → Trochanteric bursitis

### Compensatory Overuse

**Mechanism:**
- Altered movement patterns
- Increased friction on bursae
- Repetitive irritation

**Common Patterns:**
- Knee condition → Hip bursitis from limping
- Back condition → Hip bursitis from altered gait
- Shoulder condition → Elbow bursitis from compensating

### Mechanical Changes

**From Joint Conditions:**
- Bone spurs irritating bursa
- Joint instability increasing friction
- Altered alignment stressing bursae

## VA Rating Criteria

Bursitis is typically rated under DC 5019 (Bursitis):

### DC 5019 - Bursitis

**Rated Based On:**
- Limitation of motion of affected part
- Painful motion
- As degenerative arthritis

**Rating Structure:**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Painful motion with X-ray evidence OR documented bursitis limiting motion |
| 20% | More severe limitation or involvement of multiple joints |

### By Joint Limitation

If bursitis causes significant ROM limitation, rated under specific joint codes:

**Shoulder (DC 5201):**
- 20%: Motion limited at shoulder level
- 30%: Motion limited midway between side and shoulder
- 40%: Motion limited to 25° from side

**Hip (DC 5252):**
- 10%: Flexion limited to 45°
- 20%: Flexion limited to 30°
- Higher with more limitation

**Knee (DC 5260/5261):**
- Based on flexion/extension limitation
- 10-30% typically

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Primary Joint Condition:**
- Service connection documentation
- Treatment history
- Current symptoms

**For Bursitis:**
- Formal bursitis diagnosis with specific location
- Physical examination findings
- Imaging if available
- Treatment records (injections, physical therapy)

### Diagnostic Studies

**MRI:**
- Shows bursal fluid accumulation
- Rules out other pathology
- Identifies specific bursa

**Ultrasound:**
- Can visualize bursal swelling
- Guides injections
- Less expensive than MRI

**X-ray:**
- May show calcific bursitis
- Rules out bone pathology
- Limited for soft tissue

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Orthopedist or physiatrist
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Bursitis diagnosis with specific location**
4. **Connection to service-connected condition**
5. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records. [Veteran] is service-connected for right knee degenerative joint disease at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Right trochanteric bursitis*

*Physical Examination:*
*- Tenderness over right greater trochanter*
*- Pain with hip abduction against resistance*
*- Positive Ober test*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] right trochanteric bursitis is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected right knee condition.*

*Medical Rationale: [Veteran's] right knee arthritis has caused altered gait mechanics with increased load on the right hip abductor complex. The repetitive irritation of the trochanteric bursa from compensatory movement is a well-recognized cause of trochanteric bursitis. The hip on the same side as a knee condition commonly develops bursitis due to both direct mechanical stress and altered muscle activation patterns."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Bursitis Location

Determine which bursa is affected:
- Same side or opposite side as primary condition?
- Document the anatomical relationship

### Step 2: Get Bursitis Diagnosed

See appropriate specialist:
- Orthopedist
- Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation
- Rheumatologist

### Step 3: Document the Mechanism

Explain how joint condition led to bursitis:
- Direct inflammation?
- Compensatory overuse?
- Mechanical factors?

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get physician opinion:
- Must explain causal relationship
- Cost: $500-$1,000

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Specific bursa location
- Link to joint condition
- Upload evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Joint examination expected
- Palpation of bursal areas
- ROM testing
- Describe symptoms thoroughly

## Common Bursitis Secondary Claims

### Trochanteric Bursitis

**Commonly Secondary To:**
- Knee conditions (same side)
- Hip arthritis (same side)
- Back conditions (ipsilateral)
- Leg length discrepancy

**Symptoms:**
- Lateral hip pain
- Pain lying on affected side
- Pain with stairs
- Point tenderness over greater trochanter

### Subacromial Bursitis

**Commonly Secondary To:**
- Shoulder arthritis
- Rotator cuff conditions
- Cervical spine conditions
- Contralateral arm conditions (overuse)

**Symptoms:**
- Shoulder pain with overhead activity
- Night pain
- Arc of pain with arm elevation

### Prepatellar Bursitis

**Commonly Secondary To:**
- Knee conditions
- Back conditions (compensatory kneeling)
- Work-related activities

**Symptoms:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague location** - Specify WHICH bursa

2. **Missing biomechanical explanation** - Must explain connection

3. **Not documenting injections** - Treatment history supports diagnosis

4. **Confusing with arthritis** - Bursitis is different condition

5. **Forgetting same-side claims** - Ipsilateral bursitis from adjacent joint

6. **No imaging** - MRI/ultrasound helpful but not required

7. **Waiting too long** - Claim when symptomatic
