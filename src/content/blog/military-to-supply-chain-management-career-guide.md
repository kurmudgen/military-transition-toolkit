# Military to Supply Chain Management: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Supply chain management offers veterans one of the most direct career transitions, with entry-level salaries of $55,000-$75,000 and senior supply chain executives earning $150,000-$250,000+. Military logistics is essentially supply chain management—you've been doing this work throughout your career. The field experienced massive growth following COVID-19 supply disruptions, and companies actively seek candidates with your experience managing complex logistics under pressure. APICS/ASCM certifications (CPIM, CSCP) accelerate advancement and can be obtained in 3-6 months.

## Why Veterans Excel in Supply Chain Management

Military logistics IS supply chain management. The same functions—procurement, warehousing, transportation, distribution, and inventory management—exist in both environments. You've practiced these skills in demanding conditions with life-or-death consequences.

Your experience with complex, global supply chains exceeds most civilian candidates. Military supply chains span the globe, operate in austere environments, and must maintain readiness levels civilian operations rarely require.

Decision-making under uncertainty is core to supply chain success. You've allocated scarce resources, prioritized competing demands, and made rapid decisions with incomplete information—exactly what supply chain managers do.

Your understanding of system interdependencies translates directly. Military operations taught you how disruptions cascade through systems and how to build resilience—critical post-pandemic supply chain priorities.

Leadership and team management experience matters in supply chain roles. You've led diverse teams, managed vendor relationships (defense contractors), and coordinated across organizational boundaries.

Security clearances provide advantages for defense supply chain roles. Defense contractors and government logistics positions value cleared supply chain professionals.

## Common Transition Mistakes

**1. Not Getting APICS/ASCM Certification**
CPIM or CSCP certification significantly improves competitiveness. Prioritize certification early.

Military supply chain experience is highly valuable. Translate it effectively with metrics and scale.

**3. Ignoring Technology Skills**
Supply chain increasingly requires technology proficiency. Learn SAP, Oracle, or other ERP systems.

**4. Not Understanding Commercial Metrics**
Military measures readiness; commercial measures cost, service, and cash. Learn financial supply chain metrics.

**5. Overlooking Manufacturing Focus**
Many supply chain roles are in manufacturing. Don't limit yourself to pure logistics positions.

**6. Not Networking in Supply Chain**
Join ASCM, attend local chapter meetings, and build relationships in the supply chain community.

**7. Ignoring Data Analytics Skills**
Supply chain analytics is growing rapidly. Develop Excel, SQL, and data visualization skills.
