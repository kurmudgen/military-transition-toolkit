# New Hampshire Hidden Veteran Benefits: No Sales Tax + Tax Breaks 2025

New Hampshire's "Live Free or Die" motto reflects its commitment to financial freedom—and this extends significantly to its veteran community. With no sales tax, property tax relief for disabled veterans, and multiple education benefits, New Hampshire offers one of the most favorable financial environments for transitioning military personnel in the nation.

## New Hampshire's Zero Sales Tax Advantage

This is the most obvious but often underutilized benefit:

**Complete Elimination of Sales Tax:**
- New Hampshire has zero state sales tax
- No local sales tax
- Applies to all purchases: groceries, vehicles, electronics, housing materials
- Veteran families save 5-10% annually compared to neighboring states

**Annual Savings Comparison:**

A family spending $50,000 annually on taxable items saves approximately:
- Compared to Vermont (6% sales tax): $3,000 annually
- Compared to Maine (5.5% sales tax): $2,750 annually
- Compared to Massachusetts (6.25% sales tax): $3,125 annually

**20-Year Cumulative Savings:** $55,000-$65,000+ for average families

This alone makes New Hampshire exceptionally attractive for military families transitioning from higher-tax states.

## Property Tax Exemption for Disabled Veterans

**Significant Property Tax Relief:**

- Service-connected disabled veterans: exemption based on disability percentage
- Applied to primary residence
- Renewal every 5 years

**Financial Impact:**
New Hampshire's average property tax rate is 2.18% (higher than national average but competitive regionally). A disabled veteran home valued at $400,000 with $50,000 exemption saves approximately $1,090 annually.

**Application:**
