# Navy IT (Information Systems Technician): Civilian Tech Career Guide (2025)

Your Navy IT rating puts you in one of the most in-demand career fields in the civilian world. You've managed networks, implemented security, and kept communications running in environments most civilian IT pros can't imagine.

The civilian tech industry is desperate for your skills—and willing to pay $70,000 to $150,000+ for them.

## Your Navy IT Skills Translated

### Military to Civilian Translation

| Navy IT Skill | Civilian Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Network administration (NMCI, CANES) | Network engineering/administration |
| Windows Server management | Systems administration |
| CISCO router/switch configuration | Network engineering |
| COMSEC/cryptographic systems | Cybersecurity |
| Help desk/user support | IT support/service desk |
| SIPR/NIPR network management | Classified/secure network administration |
| Satellite communications (SATCOM) | Telecommunications engineering |
| Video teleconference (VTC) systems | Unified communications |
| DISA STIGs compliance | Security compliance |

### What Makes Navy ITs Valuable

**Security Clearance**: If you have TS/SCI, you're immediately valuable to defense contractors and federal agencies. Clearance = $10,000-$30,000 salary premium.

**Real-World Experience**: You've managed networks under pressure—underway, in combat zones, with limited resources.

**Security Mindset**: Military networks are under constant threat. You understand security in ways most civilian IT pros don't.

**Documentation**: Navy IT requires extensive documentation. Civilian employers love this.

**Troubleshooting**: When the network goes down at sea, there's no calling the vendor. You've learned to solve problems.

### Keeping Your Clearance

Your clearance becomes inactive if not used within 24 months after separation.

**Strategy:**
