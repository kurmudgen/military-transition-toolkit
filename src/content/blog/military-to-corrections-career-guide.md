# Military to Corrections: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Corrections offers veterans immediate career entry with starting salaries of $40,000-$60,000 and experienced officers/supervisors earning $60,000-$90,000+. Your military discipline, ability to maintain order, and experience managing personnel translate directly. Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and state corrections agencies actively recruit veterans with preference points. Most veterans can secure employment within 1-3 months, making corrections one of the fastest paths to stable government employment. Academy training (4-12 weeks) is typically paid.

## Why Veterans Excel in Corrections

Military discipline and command presence are essential in corrections. You've maintained order and enforced standards—exactly what corrections requires.

Your experience managing groups of people under challenging circumstances applies directly. Military leadership translates to inmate supervision.

Physical capability and ability to handle confrontational situations prepare you for corrections work. Your training provides foundation for use-of-force situations.

Attention to detail and procedural compliance from military service align with corrections operations. Security depends on following protocols.

Your ability to remain calm under pressure distinguishes you. Corrections environments can be tense—your military experience provides composure.

Shift work and structured environments are familiar from military service. Corrections operates 24/7 with similar scheduling.
