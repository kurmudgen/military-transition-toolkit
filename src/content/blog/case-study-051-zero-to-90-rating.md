---# From 0% to 90% Rating in 14 Months: The Secondary Conditions Strategy

## Quick Facts

**Background:**
- Branch: Army
- Rank at Separation: E5 (Sergeant)
- MOS: 11B (Infantryman)
- Years of Service: 8 years (3 deployments)
- Initial VA Rating: 0%
- Final Rating: 90%
- Location: North Carolina

**Challenge:**
David separated with no VA rating despite significant service-connected injuries because he didn't understand the claims process.

**Outcome:**
Achieved 90% VA rating worth $2,241.91/month ($26,903/year) through strategic secondary conditions claims.

**Timeline:**
14 months from initial claim to 90% rating

## Background Story

### Military Service and Injuries

David served 8 years as an Army infantryman with three combat deployments to Afghanistan. His body took a beating: multiple parachute jumps, ruck marches with 100+ pounds, vehicle rollovers from IEDs, and constant physical strain. He injured his back, knees, shoulders, and developed tinnitus from weapons fire and explosions.

Despite chronic pain, David never sought treatment during service. The infantry culture discouraged medical complaints—"suck it up" was the default response. He self-medicated with ibuprofen and pushed through pain. His medical records documented only a handful of sick call visits.

When David separated, a transition brief mentioned VA disability but made it sound optional. He filed a perfunctory claim listing back pain, knee pain, and tinnitus. Without medical evidence or nexus statements, his claim was denied entirely—0% rating.

For six months, David lived with chronic pain and no compensation. Then a veteran friend said: "You need to file again with actual medical evidence and understand secondary conditions. Your 0% rating is wrong—you just didn't document anything properly."

### The Realization

David researched VA claims and realized his fundamental mistakes:
1. No medical evidence during service
2. No nexus letters connecting conditions to service
3. Didn't claim secondary conditions (conditions caused by primary conditions)
4. Didn't understand the rating schedule or how to describe symptoms
5. Filed without VSO (Veterans Service Organization) assistance

He discovered that many service-connected conditions cause secondary conditions. His back injury likely caused hip problems and radiculopathy. His knee injuries likely caused degenerative arthritis. His chronic pain likely contributed to sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety.

David committed to filing a comprehensive supplemental claim documenting everything properly with VSO help.

## The Strategy

### Month 1-3: Medical Evidence Foundation

**What They Did:**
- Scheduled appointments with VA primary care physician documenting all pain and symptoms
- Obtained private medical evaluations for back, knees, shoulders (using VA Choice/Community Care)
- Documented symptom frequency, severity, and functional impact in pain journal
- Requested complete military medical records from National Personnel Records Center
- Connected with Disabled American Veterans (DAV) VSO for claims assistance
- Underwent MRI scans for back and knees showing degenerative changes

**Tools/Resources Used:**
- VA healthcare enrollment for medical evidence building
- VA Community Care for private medical evaluations
- National Personnel Records Center for military medical records
- DAV (Disabled American Veterans) VSO for free claims help
- Symptom journal documenting daily pain levels and functional limitations

**Mistakes Made:**
- Initial doctor visits understated symptoms out of habit—learned to be completely honest about pain levels and limitations
- Didn't keep copies of all medical records initially—started organizing everything in binders
- Tried to handle claim alone first two weeks—realized VSO expertise was essential

**Key Breakthrough:**
David's DAV VSO reviewed his service records and found documentation of vehicle rollover incidents and documented back strain that David had forgotten about. The VSO said: "You have evidence—we just need to connect the dots properly. We're going to file for direct service connection AND secondary conditions. This changes everything."

### Month 4-8: Comprehensive Claims Filing

**What They Did:**
- Filed supplemental claim for back (lumbar strain) as direct service connection
- Filed supplemental claims for both knees (degenerative arthritis) as direct service connection
- Filed new claims for shoulders, tinnitus, headaches as direct service connection
- Filed secondary conditions claims: hip pain secondary to back, radiculopathy secondary to back, sleep apnea secondary to back/chronic pain, depression secondary to chronic pain
- Obtained four nexus letters from private doctors (using VSO referrals) connecting conditions to service
- Submitted buddy statements from fellow soldiers documenting injuries during service
- Completed DBQs (Disability Benefits Questionnaires) with private doctors showing severity
- DAV VSO prepared comprehensive argument referencing relevant cases and medical literature

**Tools/Resources Used:**
- DAV VSO for claims strategy and preparation
- Private IME (Independent Medical Examination) doctors for nexus letters ($400-$600 each)
- VA Form 21-0781 for PTSD/mental health claims
- Buddy statements from three former unit members
- DBQ forms completed by private physicians
- Medical literature linking chronic pain to depression and sleep disorders

**Mistakes Made:**
- First nexus letter was vague—VSO helped get more specific statement connecting service to condition
- Didn't initially claim mental health conditions—VSO encouraged filing for depression/anxiety secondary to chronic pain
- Rushed first DBQ appointment—rescheduled to ensure doctor understood severity of symptoms

**Key Breakthrough:**
During private medical evaluation for back condition, the doctor asked about sleep. David mentioned he rarely slept more than 4 hours due to pain-induced awakenings. Doctor said: "That's almost certainly service-connected sleep apnea secondary to your back condition and chronic pain. You need a sleep study." The sleep study confirmed severe obstructive sleep apnea. The VSO filed it as secondary condition—sleep apnea alone is rated at 50%.

### Month 9-14: C&P Exams and Decision

**What They Did:**
- Attended six C&P (Compensation & Pension) exams conducted by VA contractors
- Prepared for each exam using VSO guidance on accurately describing worst-case symptoms
- Brought copies of all medical evidence to C&P exams (examiners often don't have complete files)
- Followed up with VSO weekly to track claim status in VA.gov system
- When VA proposed decisions, DAV reviewed for accuracy before acceptance
- VA granted: Back 40%, knees 10% each (bilateral factor applied), sleep apnea 50%, tinnitus 10%, depression 30%
- Combined rating calculated at 90% using VA math

**Tools/Resources Used:**
- VA.gov claim tracker to monitor status
- DAV VSO for C&P exam preparation
- Medical records binders brought to each C&P exam
- VA rating decision letters
- VA combined ratings table to understand how percentages combine

**Mistakes Made:**
- First C&P exam understated symptoms—learned to describe worst days, not average days
- Didn't bring medical evidence to first exam—examiner only saw incomplete VA file
- Almost missed one C&P appointment—set multiple calendar reminders afterward

**Key Breakthrough:**
During C&P exam for depression, David honestly described how chronic pain affected his life: difficulty sleeping, irritability, social withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest in activities. The examiner asked: "Has this affected your ability to work?" David explained he'd been fired from one job due to absences from pain and had difficulty maintaining relationships. The examiner's report supported 30% rating for depression—worth $524.31/month alone.

## Key Tactics That Worked

### Tactic 1: Secondary Conditions Strategy

**What They Did:**
David didn't just claim his obvious injuries (back, knees). He claimed secondary conditions—new conditions caused by his service-connected conditions. His chronic back pain led to sleep disruption (sleep apnea), which led to depression. His back condition caused hip problems and radiculopathy. Each secondary condition added to his rating.

**Why It Worked:**
Most veterans only claim direct service-connected conditions and leave money on the table. Secondary conditions are often more severe and higher-rated than primary conditions. David's sleep apnea (50% rating) secondary to his back (40% rating) added significantly more compensation. The VA must rate secondary conditions if you prove the connection with medical evidence.

**How You Can Apply It:**
List your service-connected conditions. Research what secondary conditions commonly result from each primary condition. Back pain → sleep apnea, depression, radiculopathy, hip problems. Knee pain → hip/back problems. PTSD → depression, anxiety, sleep disorders. Tinnitus → migraine headaches. Get medical opinions connecting secondary conditions to primary conditions. File claims for everything legitimately connected. Secondary conditions can double or triple your rating.

### Tactic 2: VSO Partnership Is Essential

**What They Did:**
David partnered with a DAV VSO who knew the claims process, rating schedule, and case law. The VSO identified conditions David hadn't considered, obtained proper medical evidence, prepared legal arguments, and advocated throughout the process. The VSO's expertise turned David's 0% rating into 90%.

**Why It Worked:**
VA disability law is complex. VSOs are accredited representatives who know the system, have relationships with VA raters, and can navigate the bureaucracy effectively. VSOs identify secondary conditions, recommend medical evidence needed, prepare claims properly, and ensure nothing is missed. Their expertise is the difference between 0% and 90% for many veterans.

**How You Can Apply It:**
Never file VA claims alone. Connect with an accredited VSO immediately: DAV, VFW, American Legion, or county Veteran Service Officer. VSOs provide free help—they're paid by their organizations, not by taking a cut of your rating. Schedule an appointment, bring all military and medical records, and let them guide strategy. Their expertise is invaluable and costs you nothing.

### Tactic 3: Medical Evidence Is Everything

**What They Did:**
David built a comprehensive medical record documenting every condition and its severity. He saw VA doctors regularly, obtained private medical evaluations, underwent diagnostic tests (MRIs, sleep study), and got nexus letters from private physicians. He created an evidence file that left no doubt about his conditions and their connection to service.

**Why It Worked:**
The VA decides claims based on evidence. Without medical documentation, even legitimate conditions get denied. David's initial 0% rating resulted from lack of evidence, not lack of legitimate conditions. His 90% rating resulted from thorough medical documentation proving conditions, severity, and service connection. Evidence is the currency of VA claims.

**How You Can Apply It:**
Build medical evidence proactively. Enroll in VA healthcare and document all conditions with primary care physician. Request private evaluations through VA Community Care if needed. Undergo diagnostic tests (X-rays, MRIs, sleep studies) that objectively show condition severity. Obtain nexus letters from private doctors ($400-$600) explicitly stating: "It is at least as likely as not that [condition] is related to military service because [reasons]." More evidence = higher ratings.

### Tactic 4: Nexus Letters Bridge the Gap

**What They Did:**
David obtained four nexus letters from private physicians. Each letter explicitly stated: "It is at least as likely as not that [condition] is related to military service" and explained the medical reasoning. These letters connected his current conditions to service events even when his military medical records were sparse.

**Why It Worked:**
VA requires "nexus"—a connection between current condition and service. Many veterans lack medical documentation during service but have legitimate service-connected conditions. Nexus letters from private physicians provide the expert medical opinion that bridges this gap. The standard is "at least as likely as not" (51% probability), not "definitely" or "certainly." Nexus letters establish the required connection.

**How You Can Apply It:**
Identify conditions needing nexus letters (conditions without direct military medical documentation). Find private physicians through VSO referrals or online services like Nexus Letter Support. Expect to pay $400-$600 per letter. Provide the doctor with: your military service dates/deployments, relevant service records, current medical records, and detailed history of the condition. The letter should explicitly state "at least as likely as not" language and explain medical reasoning. These letters are often the difference between approval and denial.

### Tactic 5: Describe Worst-Case Symptoms

**What They Did:**
During C&P exams, David accurately described his worst days, not his average days. When asked about pain levels, he described the days when pain prevented him from getting out of bed or working. When asked about functional limitations, he described everything he couldn't do due to his conditions, not what he could do on good days.

**Why It Worked:**
The VA rates conditions based on severity and functional impact. Many veterans understate symptoms out of habit or stoicism, resulting in lower ratings. Rating schedules explicitly reference "worst-case" scenarios and frequency of flare-ups. By accurately describing his worst symptoms, David received ratings that reflected the true impact of his conditions on his life and employability.

**How You Can Apply It:**
Prepare for C&P exams by documenting your worst symptoms in advance. When asked about pain levels, describe your bad days. When asked about functional limitations, list everything you can't do due to the condition. When asked about frequency, be accurate about how often you experience severe symptoms. Bring family members who can corroborate your descriptions. Don't minimize or be stoic—accuracy about severity determines your rating and compensation for the rest of your life.

## Obstacles Overcome

### Obstacle 1: Initial 0% Rating and Discouragement

**The Problem:**
David's initial claim was fully denied—0% rating. He felt defeated and considered giving up. He thought: "Maybe I don't deserve disability. Maybe my injuries aren't bad enough. Maybe the VA is right."

**How They Overcame It:**
David's friend who was also a veteran said: "0% doesn't mean you're not hurt. It means you didn't document it properly. The VA isn't evil, but they only grant claims with evidence. Get a VSO, build medical evidence, and file again." David connected with DAV, and the VSO immediately said: "You absolutely have service-connected conditions. We're going to do this right this time."

That validation and professional guidance shifted David's mindset from defeated to determined.

**Lesson Learned:**
Initial denials or low ratings are often procedural problems, not judgments on whether injuries are real. The VA requires specific evidence and proper documentation. A 0% rating with legitimate injuries means you need to refile with better evidence and VSO help. Don't give up after initial denial—most successful claims involve appeals or supplemental claims with additional evidence.

### Obstacle 2: Understating Symptoms at First C&P Exam

**The Problem:**
During David's first C&P exam (for back condition), the examiner asked: "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your pain?" David said "6" because that felt honest for an average day. He didn't mention his worst days when pain was 9-10 and he couldn't work. The examiner's report noted "moderate pain" which would have resulted in lower rating.

**How They Overcame It:**
David's VSO reviewed the C&P report and said: "You undersold it. We need to request a new exam and this time, describe your worst days." At the second exam, when asked the same question, David said: "On average it's a 6, but at least weekly it spikes to 9-10 where I can't function. Those days I can't work, can't exercise, and sometimes can't get out of bed." The examiner documented this as "severe pain with frequent flare-ups" supporting higher rating.

**Lesson Learned:**
C&P exams determine your rating and compensation for life. Accuracy about worst-case symptoms is essential. Many veterans understate due to military stoicism or not wanting to seem weak. This costs tens of thousands of dollars. Describe your worst days, frequency of flare-ups, and functional limitations honestly. Bring family members who can corroborate. VSO should prepare you for C&P exams beforehand.

### Obstacle 3: Missing Service Medical Records

**The Problem:**
David's military medical records were sparse—only a few sick call visits documented despite 8 years of service and multiple injuries. When he filed his initial claim, the VA said there was insufficient medical evidence of conditions during service, contributing to his 0% rating.

**How They Overcame It:**
David's VSO used alternative evidence to establish service connection: buddy statements from fellow soldiers documenting David's injuries during deployment, service records showing deployment locations and dates (combat zone exposure), and nexus letters from private physicians connecting current conditions to military service based on medical probability. The VSO argued: "Lack of medical records doesn't mean conditions didn't occur—it reflects infantry culture discouraging medical complaints."

The combination of alternative evidence and nexus letters established service connection despite sparse military medical records.

**Lesson Learned:**
Missing service medical records don't mean you can't get service-connected ratings. Use alternative evidence: buddy statements, service records showing deployments/combat exposure, personal statements detailing injuries, and nexus letters from private physicians. VSOs know how to build cases with incomplete military records. Don't assume lack of documentation means automatic denial.

## What They'd Do Differently

### Looking Back

Two years after achieving 90% rating, David reflected on lessons learned.

**Would Change:**

1. **Document Everything During Service**: "If I could go back, I'd go to sick call for every injury and pain issue. The military medical records would have made my claims process 10x easier. Document everything while you're in—you'll thank yourself later."

2. **Connect with VSO Before Separating**: "I filed my first claim alone during terminal leave. I should have connected with DAV 6-12 months before separation to prepare properly. That would have avoided the 0% rating and 6 months of unnecessary delay."

3. **File for Mental Health Earlier**: "I waited months to file for depression because I didn't think mental health counted. It added 30% to my rating. I should have filed immediately—mental health conditions are legitimate and often secondary to chronic pain."

**Would Keep:**

1. **Using DAV VSO**: "Best decision I made. The VSO's expertise turned my 0% into 90%. Never try to navigate VA claims alone—free expert help is available and essential."

2. **Investing in Nexus Letters**: "Spending $2,400 on four nexus letters felt expensive, but it paid for itself in one month of disability payments. Best investment I ever made."

3. **Being Thorough with Secondary Conditions**: "Filing for every secondary condition—even ones I wasn't sure about—was smart. Sleep apnea alone is worth $1,400/month. I almost didn't file for it."

## Advice for Others

### Who This Strategy Works For

This approach works for any veteran with service-connected conditions who received a low rating or denial due to insufficient evidence.

**Best fit if you:**
- Have legitimate service-connected injuries/conditions (even without military medical records)
- Received 0% rating or low rating that doesn't reflect actual condition severity
- Have chronic pain, joint problems, or mental health conditions from service

- Can afford private medical evaluations and nexus letters ($2,000-$3,000 investment)
- Have patience for 12-18 month claims process
- Are committed to accurate, thorough documentation

**Might not work if:**
- You have no legitimate service-connected conditions (don't file fraudulent claims)
- You're unwilling to invest time and some money in medical evidence
- You can't be patient through 12+ month claims process
- You're unwilling to work with VSO (trying to navigate alone significantly reduces success)

## Key Takeaways

### For You to Remember

1. **Secondary Conditions Can Double Your Rating**: Don't just claim primary injuries. Identify and claim secondary conditions caused by service-connected conditions. Sleep apnea secondary to chronic pain, depression secondary to chronic pain, hip problems secondary to back injury. Secondary conditions often rate higher than primary conditions.

2. **VSO Partnership Is Essential**: Never file VA claims alone. VSOs know the system, identify conditions you'd miss, recommend evidence needed, and prepare claims properly. Their expertise often means the difference between 0% and 90%. They're free—use them.

3. **Medical Evidence Is Everything**: Build comprehensive medical documentation. See VA doctors regularly, undergo diagnostic tests, obtain nexus letters from private physicians. Evidence is the currency of VA claims. Invest time and money in building thorough evidence.

4. **Nexus Letters Bridge Gaps in Service Records**: If you lack military medical documentation, nexus letters from private physicians can establish service connection. Expect to pay $400-$600 per letter. These letters are often the difference between approval and denial—worth the investment.

5. **Describe Worst-Case Symptoms at C&P Exams**: Don't minimize or be stoic. Accurately describe your worst days, frequency of flare-ups, and functional limitations. Your rating for life depends on how you describe symptoms during C&P exams. VSO should prepare you beforehand.

### Success Factors

What made this work:
- **Partnership with experienced DAV VSO**: Expert guidance through entire process
- **Comprehensive secondary conditions strategy**: Identified and claimed all related conditions
- **Thorough medical evidence**: VA healthcare, private evaluations, diagnostic tests, nexus letters
- **Accurate C&P exam descriptions**: Described worst-case symptoms and functional limitations
- **Patience and persistence**: 14-month process from start to 90% rating
- **Investment in nexus letters**: $2,400 spent on medical opinions that secured rating

### Warning Signs

What could have derailed them:
- **Giving up after 0% rating**: Initial denial is often procedural, not judgment on legitimacy. Solution: Refile with VSO help and proper evidence.
- **Filing alone without VSO**: Reduces success rate dramatically. Solution: Always partner with accredited VSO.
- **Minimizing symptoms at C&P exams**: Stoicism costs money. Solution: Accurately describe worst-case symptoms.
- **Not claiming secondary conditions**: Leaves significant money on table. Solution: Research and file for all legitimately connected conditions.
- **Insufficient medical evidence**: Claims without documentation get denied. Solution: Invest time building comprehensive medical records.
