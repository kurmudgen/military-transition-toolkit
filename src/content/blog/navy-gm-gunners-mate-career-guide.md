EOD contractor (overseas): $100,000-$150,000+

### Do I need additional certifications?
Depends on path. Defense contractors often train you. Gunsmithing may require specific certifications. Industrial maintenance benefits from CMRT.

### Can I do weapons work without staying in defense?
Yes—firearms industry, law enforcement, and private security all value weapons expertise. Industrial maintenance uses the same mechanical/electrical skills.

### What about my clearance?
Keep it active if possible—cleared positions pay significantly more. Apply for cleared jobs before separation.

### Is overseas contractor work worth it?
Pays very well ($100K-$150K+) but lifestyle cost is significant. Good for building savings, not for long-term.

## Bottom Line

Your GM skills translate to specialized, well-paying careers. The defense industry specifically seeks Navy weapons technicians, and your broader technical skills open doors in manufacturing, aerospace, and industrial maintenance.

**Best opportunities for GMs:**
1. **Defense contractor** - Direct skill translation, use clearance
2. **Federal civilian/law enforcement** - Stability, veteran preference
3. **Industrial maintenance** - Broad application of technical skills
4. **Firearms industry** - If passionate about weapons

You've maintained systems where failure isn't an option. That precision and expertise is valuable in civilian careers.
