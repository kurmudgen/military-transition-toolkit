## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between sheet metal worker and HVAC technician?**
A: Sheet metal workers fabricate and install ductwork. HVAC technicians service equipment (A/C, heating). Some overlap exists; many sheet metal workers also do HVAC service.

**Q: Is sheet metal work only ductwork?**
A: No. Includes architectural metalwork, industrial fabrication, stainless steel kitchen equipment, and specialty products.

**Q: How physical is sheet metal work?**
A: Moderately to very physical. Lifting, climbing, working overhead. Good fitness is important.

**Q: Do I need welding skills?**
A: Welding is learned in apprenticeship. Prior experience helps but isn't required.

**Q: Is union or non-union better?**
A: Union (SMART) typically offers higher wages, better benefits, and pension. Recommended if available in your area.

**Q: What's the earning potential?**
A: Journeymen earn $60,000-$95,000. Foremen and specialty workers can exceed $100,000.

**Q: Is there shop work available?**
A: Yes. Many sheet metal workers work in fabrication shops rather than job sites. Shop work is less weather-dependent.

**Q: What about CAD/CAM technology?**
A: Increasingly important. CNC machines and CAD software are standard in modern shops.

## Continuing Education

**Career advancement:**
1. **Welding certifications:** Increases versatility
2. **CAD/CAM training:** Design and fabrication
3. **TAB (Testing, Adjusting, Balancing):** Specialty
4. **Architectural metalwork:** Premium specialty
5. **Contractor license:** Business ownership
