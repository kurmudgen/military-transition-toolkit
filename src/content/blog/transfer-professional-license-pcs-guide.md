# How to Transfer Professional Licenses During PCS: Step-by-Step Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Transferring professional licenses during PCS requires **early planning** (start 90+ days before move), **proper documentation**, and **leveraging military spouse provisions**. The typical timeline is **30-90 days** depending on profession and state, but military spouse expedited processing can reduce this significantly. This guide provides a step-by-step process for any licensed profession, along with checklists and troubleshooting strategies.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Every PCS threatens licensed professionals with:
- Lost income during relicensing period
- Complex paperwork across multiple boards
- Potential duplicate requirements (exams, coursework)
- Fees of $100-$1,000+ per license
- Career gaps that compound over time

**The Solution:** Start early, document everything, and use every military spouse accommodation available.

## License Transfer Timeline

### Ideal Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **90+ days before PCS** | Research destination state requirements |
| **60-90 days before** | Request license verifications, gather documents |
| **45-60 days before** | Submit application to new state |
| **30-45 days before** | Follow up, address issues, request expedited processing |
| **0-30 days after arrival** | Complete any in-state requirements (fingerprints, etc.) |
| **30-90 days after** | Receive new license (or temporary) |

### Emergency Timeline (If You Start Late)

If you have less than 60 days:
1. Contact new state licensing board immediately
2. Explain military spouse status and timeline
3. Request temporary/expedited license
4. Submit application as quickly as possible
5. Follow up persistently

## Step-by-Step Transfer Process

### Step 1: Research Destination State Requirements (90+ Days Out)

**Find Your Licensing Board:**
- Google: "[State] [Profession] licensing board"
- Example: "Texas nursing board" or "California teacher credential"

**Determine Requirements:**
- Check if state participates in interstate compact
- Identify endorsement/reciprocity procedures
- Note required documents
- Find fees
- Locate military spouse provisions

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. Is there an interstate compact for my profession?
2. Does the state offer military spouse expedited processing?
3. What documents are required?
4. Are there additional exams or coursework requirements?
5. Is temporary licensure available?

### Step 2: Gather Documents (60-90 Days Out)

**Typical Documents Required:**

| Document | Where to Get It |
|----------|-----------------|
| Current license copy | Your files or state portal |
| License verification | Request from issuing state |
| Official transcripts | Universities attended |
| Exam scores (if applicable) | National testing organization |
| Proof of work experience | Employers, signed forms |
| Background check | New state may require new one |
| PCS orders | Military orders |
| Marriage certificate | Proves spouse status |

**License Verification Process:**
1. Contact current state licensing board
2. Request "license verification" or "certification of license"
3. May require fee ($20-$50)
4. Some states do electronic verification (faster)
5. Request they send directly to new state if possible

**Pro Tip:** Some states accept National Practitioner Data Bank or other national verification systems. Ask both states if this applies.

### Step 3: Apply to New State (45-60 Days Out)

**Application Submission:**
1. Complete application form (often online)
2. Pay application fee (check for military spouse waivers)
3. Submit all supporting documents
4. Clearly identify yourself as military spouse
5. Request expedited processing

**Military Spouse Identification:**
Include with your application:
- Copy of PCS orders
- Copy of marriage certificate
- Written request for military spouse provisions
- Reference specific state law if known

**Application Tips:**
- Keep copies of everything submitted
- Use certified mail or get digital confirmation
- Note application/confirmation numbers
- Set calendar reminder to follow up

### Step 4: Follow Up and Expedite (30-45 Days Out)

**Follow Up Strategy:**
- Call or email 2 weeks after submission
- Ask: "What is the status of my application?"
- Ask: "Is there anything missing or needed?"
- Ask: "Can processing be expedited as a military spouse?"

**If There Are Issues:**
- Address immediately (don't wait)
- Provide any additional documentation quickly
- Ask for supervisor if frontline staff can't help
- Document all communications

**Requesting Temporary License:**
If available in your profession:
- Ask specifically: "Can I receive a temporary license while my full application processes?"
- Some states issue automatic temporary to military spouses
- Others require specific request

### Step 5: Complete Post-Arrival Requirements (After PCS)

**Common Post-Arrival Steps:**
- Fingerprinting at in-state location
- In-person identity verification
- State-specific jurisprudence exam (some professions)
- Address update with new state

**Fingerprinting:**
- Often required even if you did one in old state
- Use livescan/digital services when available
- Schedule early to avoid delays

### Step 6: Receive License and Begin Work

**When You Receive License:**
- Verify all information is correct
- Note expiration date
- Understand renewal requirements
- Begin working!

**If License is Delayed:**
- Contact board again
- Escalate to military spouse liaison if available
- Contact your congressman's office for constituent services (they can help)
- Consider contacting installation legal assistance

*License transfer doesn't have to mean lost income. With early planning, proper documentation, and leveraging military spouse provisions, most professionals can minimize the gap between duty stations.
