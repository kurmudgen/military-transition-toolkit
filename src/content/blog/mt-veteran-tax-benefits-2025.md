# Montana Veteran Benefits 2025: Property Tax, Income Tax & Financial Guide

Montana offers strong and improving tax benefits for veterans, particularly with new legislation phasing in military retirement income exemptions. If you're a veteran considering Montana or already living here, understanding these benefits can save you thousands of dollars annually.

## Bottom Line Up Front

Here's what Montana offers veterans:

- **Military retirement pay**: 50% exempt from state income tax starting 2026 (phasing to higher percentages in future years)
- **Property tax reduction**: Up to $240 reduction annually for 100% disabled veterans on qualifying property
- **VA disability pay**: Completely tax-free (federal and state)
- **Disabled veteran property tax assistance**: Additional programs for qualifying veterans
- **No sales tax**: Montana is one of five states with no statewide sales tax
- **Hunting and fishing licenses**: Free for disabled veterans

**Potential annual savings for a 100% disabled veteran**: $2,000-$3,500+ depending on income and property value.

## Income Tax Treatment for Veterans

### Military Retirement Pay - NEW Partial Exemption (Starting 2026)

Montana passed legislation in 2023 that begins **phasing in an exemption for military retirement income**.

**2025 (Current)**: Military retirement pay is fully taxable at Montana's regular income tax rates

**2026**: **50% of military retirement pay exempt** from state income tax

**Future years**: The exemption percentage is expected to increase incrementally, with the goal of reaching 100% exemption in coming years (subject to legislative appropriations)

**What this means starting in 2026**:
- Retire with $30,000/year military pension? Only $15,000 taxable
- Retire with $50,000/year? Only $25,000 taxable
- No age restrictions, no income limits on the exemption

This puts Montana on track to join the elite group of states that fully exempt military retirement pay.

### VA Disability Compensation - Tax-Free

All VA disability compensation is exempt from federal and state taxation. Whether you receive $165/month for a 10% rating or $3,800+/month for 100% with dependents, you won't pay a dime in taxes on it.

### Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)

SBP payments follow the same rules as military retirement pay:
- **2025**: Fully taxable
- **2026 and beyond**: 50% exempt (matching military retirement exemption)

### State Tax Rates (For Other Income)

Montana operates on a **graduated income tax system** with brackets that changed in 2024:

**2024-2025 Tax Brackets**:
- **4.7%** on income up to $20,500
- **5.9%** on income between $20,500-$51,500
- **6.5%** on income over $51,500

**Standard deduction**: $5,100 (single), $10,200 (married filing jointly) for 2024

Montana's income tax system is more progressive than many Western states, with higher earners paying higher rates.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Benefits (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Montana** | 50% exempt (2026+) | 4.7-6.5% | $240 reduction |
| Idaho | 100% exempt | 5.8% flat (2024) | Varies by county |
| Wyoming | N/A | No income tax | Varies |
| North Dakota | 100% exempt | 2.9% flat (2024) | Varies |
| South Dakota | N/A | No income tax | 100% exemption |

Montana is catching up to its neighbors. While Wyoming and South Dakota have no income tax, Montana's new 50% military retirement exemption (growing in future years) combined with no sales tax creates a competitive tax environment.

## Property Tax Reduction for Disabled Veterans

### 100% Disabled Veterans - Up to $240 Annual Reduction

If you're rated 100% service-connected disabled by the VA, you qualify for a **property tax reduction of up to $240** per year on your primary residence.

**Key details**:
- Reduction amount: Up to $240 per year
- Based on property assessment
- Must be primary residence
- Must have 100% service-connected disability rating
- Administered by county assessor

**This is a reduction in assessed value**, which translates to lower property tax.

#### How the Reduction Works

Montana's property tax reduction provides a **reduction in assessed value**, not a direct dollar credit.

**Example calculation**:
- Home market value: $400,000
- Assessed value: ~$160,000 (Montana assesses residential property at approximately 40% of market value)
- Veteran reduction: Reduces taxable value further
- **Net tax savings**: Approximately $240 per year (varies by mill levy)

#### Real-World Examples

**Billings (Yellowstone County)**
- Home value: $378,000
- Approximate property tax: $2,800/year

- Home value: $520,000
- Approximate property tax: $3,800/year

- **Effective tax after reduction: ~$3,560**

### Additional Property Tax Assistance Programs

Montana offers additional property tax assistance for disabled veterans through local programs:

**Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Property Tax Exemption**
Some counties offer additional exemptions for disabled veterans. **Check with your county assessor** - programs vary by county.

**Property Tax Assistance Program**
Low-income disabled veterans may qualify for additional property tax assistance through Montana's general property tax assistance program.

**Eligibility**:
- Income limits apply (typically household income under $50,000)
- Must be primary residence

**Contact your county treasurer's office** for details specific to your county.

## Vehicle Registration Benefits

### Disabled Veterans - Reduced Registration Fees

**Disabled Veteran License Plates**:

## Other Financial Benefits

Montana is one of only **five states with no statewide sales tax** (along with Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Oregon).

**What this means**:
- No tax on purchases (cars, appliances, electronics, clothing, etc.)
- No tax on services
- Significant savings compared to states with 6-10% sales tax

**Annual savings estimate**: $800-$1,500 for average household compared to states with sales tax

**Montana has 55 state parks** - this benefit has real value if you enjoy outdoor recreation.

Some municipalities may offer fee reductions for disabled veteran-owned businesses. **Check with your local business licensing office.**

### Homestead Exemption (General)

Montana's homestead exemption is available to all homeowners, not specifically veterans:

**Amount**: $250,000 of home equity is exempt from creditors

**This is a bankruptcy/creditor protection**, not a tax exemption. All Montana homeowners benefit.

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the 20-year financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran retiring in Montana vs. other states.

### Scenario: E-8 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled

**Annual income**:
- Military retirement: $35,000
- VA disability: $45,000 (100% with dependents)
- Total: $80,000

**Home**: $400,000 (median for Montana cities in 2025)
**Property tax**: ~$2,950/year (varies by location)

### Montana Savings Over 20 Years

**Baseline (2025 - before military retirement exemption)**:

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax reduction | $240 | $4,800 |
| No sales tax (vs. 6% sales tax state) | $1,200 | $24,000 |
| Hunting/fishing license | $70 | $1,400 |
| State parks pass | $35 | $700 |
| **TOTAL (2025)** | **$1,545** | **$30,900** |

**With 50% Military Retirement Exemption (2026+)**:

| Benefit | Annual Savings | 20-Year Total |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Property tax reduction | $240 | $4,800 |
| Military retirement 50% exemption (vs. full taxation at avg 5.5%) | $962 | $19,240 |
| No sales tax (vs. 6% sales tax state) | $1,200 | $24,000 |
| Hunting/fishing license | $70 | $1,400 |
| State parks pass | $35 | $700 |
| **TOTAL (2026+)** | **$2,507** | **$50,140** |

**Note**: If military retirement exemption increases to 100% in future years, savings would increase by approximately $19,000 over 20 years (total $69,000+).

### Comparison: Montana vs. Idaho

Idaho fully exempts military retirement but has higher sales tax:

| State | Property Tax Savings | Income Tax Savings | Sales Tax Impact | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Montana (2026+) | $4,800 | $19,240 | $24,000 saved | $50,140 |
| Idaho | Varies | $38,480 (full exemption) | -$24,000 (6% sales tax) | ~$45,000 |

**Montana advantage with no sales tax** makes up significant ground, especially as military retirement exemption increases.

### Comparison: Montana vs. Wyoming

Wyoming has no income tax but does have 4% sales tax:

| State | Property Tax | Income Tax | Sales Tax Impact | Total 20-Year Savings |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Montana (2026+) | $4,800 | $19,240 | $24,000 saved | $50,140 |
| Wyoming | Varies | $38,480 (no income tax) | -$16,000 (4% sales tax) | ~$50,000 |

**Essentially equivalent**, with Montana offering more state services and amenities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to reapply for the property tax reduction every year?

**It depends on your county**. Most counties continue the reduction automatically once approved, as long as you maintain your 100% rating and property ownership. However, some counties may require periodic re-certification (every 2-3 years). Contact your county assessor for their specific policy.

### What if I'm rated 90% or lower?

Montana's $240 property tax reduction is **only for 100% service-connected disabled veterans**. If you're rated below 100%, you don't qualify for the veteran-specific property tax reduction.

However, you may qualify for:
- General property tax assistance if you meet income limits
- County-specific programs (check with your county assessor)
- All other benefits (hunting/fishing licenses, state parks pass, license plates) are available to disabled veterans at any rating percentage

### Can I get the property tax reduction on a second home or rental property?

No. The reduction applies only to your **primary residence** where you live most of the year.

### What if my property tax is less than $240?

The reduction is capped at your actual property tax amount. You receive the reduction up to $240, or your actual tax owed, whichever is less.

### Are military retirement benefits taxed if I move to Montana from another state?

Currently (2025), yes - military retirement is fully taxable in Montana regardless of where you served or previously lived.

**Starting 2026**, 50% of military retirement income will be exempt, and this exemption applies to all Montana residents receiving military retirement, regardless of previous state of residence.

### Will the military retirement exemption increase beyond 50%?

Montana's legislation **phases in the exemption incrementally**. While 50% starts in 2026, the goal is to reach higher percentages (potentially 100%) in future years, subject to legislative appropriations and budget considerations.

**Stay informed** by monitoring Montana legislature updates and contacting the Montana Department of Revenue.

### Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax reduction after I die?

**Check with your county assessor**. Montana law is less clear on this than some states. Some counties may allow unremarried surviving spouses to maintain the reduction, while others may not. Contact your county assessor for their policy.

### What if my county denies my property tax reduction application?

If your reduction is denied:
1. Request explanation in writing
2. Verify you submitted all required documentation (VA letter, proof of residence, etc.)
3. Contact Montana Department of Military Affairs - Veterans Services: (406) 324-3742
4. Contact your county veterans service officer
5. You may have the right to appeal the denial through your county board

### Do I need to be retired from the military to get these benefits?

- **Property tax reduction**: No, only need 100% service-connected disability rating
- **Income tax exemption on military retirement** (2026+): Yes, must be receiving military retirement pay
- **License plates**: No, only need service-connected disability rating
- **Hunting/fishing licenses**: No, only need service-connected disability rating

### Does Montana tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?

Yes, at Montana's regular income tax rates (4.7-6.5%). Qualified retirement account withdrawals are treated as regular income.

However, Montana does offer a **pension and annuity income exemption** up to $5,100 for taxpayers 65 and older, which could apply to TSP/401(k) withdrawals.

### What about the "Last Best Place" property taxes?

Montana has experienced **significant property value appreciation** in recent years, particularly in Bozeman, Missoula, and Kalispell. While property values have increased dramatically, Montana law limits annual property tax increases.

**2024 property tax reforms** are being implemented to provide additional relief, including:
- Increased homestead exemption rates
- Mill levy limitations
- Reassessment cycles

**For veterans**: The $240 reduction remains available regardless of property value increases, though its impact becomes smaller as property values rise.

### Does no sales tax really save money?

**Absolutely**. Montana's lack of sales tax provides significant savings:

**Example household purchases**:
- New vehicle ($35,000): Save $2,100 (vs. 6% sales tax state)
- Appliances ($3,000): Save $180
- Electronics ($1,500): Save $90
- Clothing/goods ($5,000/year): Save $300

**Annual savings: $570+ on regular purchases, plus $2,100 on major purchases like vehicles**

### Will moving to Montana from a high-tax state save me money?

**Likely yes, starting in 2026** when military retirement exemption begins. Compared to states like California (13.3% top rate), Oregon (9.9%), or Minnesota (9.85%), Montana offers significant savings.

**Example**: E-7 retiree with $30,000/year pension
- California state tax (assume 9.3% bracket): ~$2,790/year
- Montana 2025: ~$1,650/year
- Montana 2026+ (50% exempt): ~$825/year
- **Annual savings 2026+: ~$1,965**
- **20-year savings: ~$39,300**

Plus no sales tax in Montana saves additional $800-$1,500 annually.

### Can I claim both the property tax reduction and the elderly homeowner/renter credit?

No. Montana law prohibits claiming multiple property tax credits. If you qualify for multiple programs (veteran, elderly, disabled person), you can only claim the most beneficial one.

For most 100% disabled veterans under 65, the veteran reduction is the best available option.

## Key Takeaways

Montana delivers improving financial value for veterans:

1. **Starting 2026**: 50% military retirement exemption saves $1,000-$2,000 annually
2. **100% disabled veterans** save $240 annually on property taxes
3. **No sales tax** saves $800-$1,500 annually compared to sales tax states
4. **Disabled veterans** get free hunting/fishing licenses and state parks access
5. **Future improvements likely** as military retirement exemption percentage increases

Combined with Montana's exceptional quality of life, outdoor recreation, and no sales tax, these benefits make Montana increasingly attractive for military retirees.

If you're 100% service-connected disabled and haven't applied for the property tax reduction yet, contact your county assessor today. And plan ahead for the 2026 military retirement exemption - it's a game-changer.
