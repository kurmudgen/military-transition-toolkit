## Summary

**Military-Transition.org is a solid content library** with comprehensive guidebooks and unique state-level research, but it's **purely informational and lacks any interactive tools**. It's built for **readers, not doers**.

**MTT's opportunity:** Build what Military-Transition.org can't - **interactive, personalized, mobile-first tools** that turn their passive content into active planning. Create the **"Wikipedia to MTT's Google Maps"** - they tell you about transition, MTT guides you through it step-by-step.

**Key insight:** Their **state benefits data is valuable** but buried in text. MTT should create a **state benefits comparison tool** that makes this actionable. Their **research insights** could inform MTT's content strategy and feature prioritization.

**Partnership potential:** Military-Transition.org might welcome a partnership where MTT makes their content interactive and accessible to a wider audience.
