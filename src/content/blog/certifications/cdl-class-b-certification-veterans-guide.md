# CDL Class B for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

A Commercial Driver's License (CDL) Class B allows you to operate single vehicles over 26,001 pounds—buses, straight trucks, dump trucks, and delivery vehicles. Training costs $1,500-$6,000, fully covered by GI Bill through approved programs. Most programs take 2-6 weeks. CDL Class B offers more local opportunities with home-every-night options. Veterans with military driving experience may qualify for expedited licensing. Class B drivers earn $40,000-$70,000, with specialized positions like school bus drivers enjoying excellent benefits and schedules.

## What Is CDL Class B?

A CDL Class B license allows you to operate single vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 pounds or more, or any such vehicle towing a trailer/vehicle weighing less than 10,000 pounds. This includes:

- Straight trucks (box trucks, delivery trucks)
- Large buses (city transit, school buses, tour buses)
- Dump trucks
- Concrete mixers
- Garbage trucks
- Large tow trucks (without heavy trailers)

CDL Class B is ideal for veterans seeking local driving positions with regular home time.
