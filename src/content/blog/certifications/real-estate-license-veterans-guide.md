# Real Estate License for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

A real estate license allows you to represent buyers and sellers in property transactions. Pre-licensing courses cost $200-$1,000, with exam fees of $50-$150 depending on state. Training takes 2-6 months. Veterans have a unique advantage: expertise in VA home loans makes you invaluable to military buyers. First-year agents typically earn $30,000-$50,000, but successful agents earn $75,000-$150,000+. GI Bill may cover real estate programs through approved schools.

## Veteran Success Story

**Master Sergeant David W., Air Force Security Forces → Real Estate Team Lead**
"After 20 years in the Air Force, I wanted control of my schedule. Got licensed in 3 months using savings. First year was tough—made $38K. But I specialized in VA loans and serving military families. Year three hit $125K. Now I lead a team of four agents, all veterans, and we're the go-to team for military relocations in our area. My understanding of PCS moves and VA loans is invaluable."
