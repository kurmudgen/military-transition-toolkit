# Insurance License (Property & Casualty) for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

A Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance license allows you to sell auto, home, business, and liability insurance. Pre-licensing courses cost $200-$500, with exam fees of $50-$100. Most people complete licensing in 2-4 weeks. Veterans' trustworthiness and communication skills excel in insurance sales. Entry-level agents earn $40,000-$55,000, while successful agents and agency owners earn $80,000-$200,000+. Many insurance companies actively recruit veterans with excellent training programs and immediate income potential.
