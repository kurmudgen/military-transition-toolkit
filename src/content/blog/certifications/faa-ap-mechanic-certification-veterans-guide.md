# FAA A&P Mechanic License for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The FAA Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) certificate is the federal license required to maintain and repair aircraft. Training costs $15,000-$50,000 but is fully covered by GI Bill. Programs take 12-24 months, but veterans with qualifying military aviation maintenance experience can test directly without additional schooling. A&P mechanics earn $55,000-$85,000, with senior mechanics and inspectors exceeding $100,000. The aviation industry faces a critical mechanic shortage, with 600,000+ new technicians needed globally by 2040.

## What Is an FAA A&P License?

The FAA A&P (Airframe and Powerplant) certificate authorizes you to maintain and repair aircraft. It's actually two ratings:

**Airframe (A)**: Covers fuselage, wings, control surfaces, landing gear, hydraulics, electrical systems, environmental systems

**Powerplant (P)**: Covers engines, propellers, fuel systems, lubrication, ignition, starting systems

**Combination A&P**: Most mechanics earn both ratings together (highly recommended)

Additional ratings and authorizations:
- Inspection Authorization (IA): Allows annual inspections, return to service after major repairs
- Avionics: Specialized electronics (often separate training)

## Why Veterans Excel at Aviation Maintenance

Military aviation maintenance experience is directly applicable:

**Hands-On Experience**: Military mechanics maintain complex aircraft systems daily.

**Safety Culture**: Aviation safety is critical in both military and civilian maintenance.

**Documentation Skills**: Military maintenance requires detailed documentation—essential for FAA work.

**Technical Training**: Military aviation schools are world-class.

**Directly Related MOSs/Ratings**:
- Army: 15 series (Aviation MOSs): 15B, 15D, 15G, 15H, 15N, 15R, 15T, 15U, 15Y
- Navy: AD (Aviation Machinist's Mate), AM (Aviation Structural Mechanic), AE (Aviation Electrician's Mate), AT (Aviation Electronics Technician)
- Air Force: 2A series (Aircraft Maintenance AFSCs): 2A3X3, 2A5X1, 2A6X1, etc.
- Marines: 60/61/62/63 series (Aviation MOSs)
- Coast Guard: Aviation maintenance rates

**Critical Advantage**: Military experience often qualifies for direct testing—no additional school required!

## Requirements & Prerequisites

**FAA Certification Requirements** (14 CFR Part 65):

**Path 1: FAA-Approved School** (Traditional)
- Complete 1,900 hours total (Airframe: 1,150, Powerplant: 750)
- Graduate from FAA Part 147 approved school

**Path 2: Military Experience** (Veterans' Fast-Track)
- 18 months practical experience in appropriate military specialty
- Can test directly for A&P without additional schooling
- FAA Form 8610-2 documenting military experience

**Path 3: Civilian Experience**

7. **Overlooking IA Opportunity**: Inspection Authorization significantly increases earning potential

## Veteran Success Stories

**Master Sergeant (Ret.) Robert K., Air Force 2A6X1 → Lead Mechanic**
"18 years maintaining F-16s made civilian A&P testing straightforward. I studied for 2 months using ASA materials, took all three written tests in one week, and passed the practical on first attempt. Started at Delta at $72K. Three years later, I'm a lead mechanic at $95K. Best part? I kept all my GI Bill for my kids' college."

**Aviation Machinist's Mate First Class Sarah T., Navy → DOM**
"Navy experience on P-8 Poseidons directly qualified me. Used the military experience pathway—no school needed. FAA Form 8610-2 documented everything. Passed A&P in 3 months after separation. Started at $65K at a corporate flight department. Now Director of Maintenance at $135K."
