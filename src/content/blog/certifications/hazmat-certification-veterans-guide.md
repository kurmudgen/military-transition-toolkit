## Veteran Success Story

**Staff Sergeant Carlos R., Army 74D CBRN → Environmental Safety Supervisor**
"10 years as CBRN specialist prepared me perfectly. My military training satisfied many civilian requirements. Took HAZWOPER 40-hour to get official civilian certification. Started at hazardous waste company at $52K. Now supervise site safety operations at $78K. Companies value veterans who've worked with real hazards under pressure—we don't panic."
