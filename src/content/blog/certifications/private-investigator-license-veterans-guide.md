# Private Investigator License for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Private investigator licensing requirements vary significantly by state—some require no license while others mandate training and experience. Costs range from $100-$1,500 for licensing. Veterans with military police, intelligence, or investigative backgrounds have significant advantages—some states waive requirements for military experience. Entry-level PIs earn $35,000-$50,000, with experienced investigators and agency owners earning $60,000-$120,000+. Excellent career for veterans seeking independence and investigation work.

**Special Agent David R., Army CID → PI Agency Owner**
"10 years investigating crimes in CID gave me the foundation. California waived most experience requirements for military investigators. Started with an agency at $50K to learn the business side. After 2 years, opened my own shop. Now billing $180K with focus on corporate investigations.
