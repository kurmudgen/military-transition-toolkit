# RHIT (Registered Health Information Technician) for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The Registered Health Information Technician (RHIT) certification validates expertise in managing patient health information and medical records. Requires an associate degree from an AHIMA-accredited program (2 years, $10,000-$30,000). GI Bill fully covers accredited programs. Veterans with military medical records or administrative experience have advantages. RHITs earn $40,000-$55,000, with advancement to RHIA (bachelor's level) or specialty roles paying $60,000-$90,000. Healthcare's digital transformation creates strong demand.

## What Is RHIT Certification?

RHIT-certified professionals manage health information systems and ensure medical record accuracy:

- Maintaining patient health records

RHIT is awarded by AHIMA (American Health Information Management Association).
