# AWS Welding Certification for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

American Welding Society (AWS) certifications validate welding skills across various processes and positions. Certification testing costs $35-$250 per test, with training programs ranging from $3,000-$20,000 (covered by GI Bill). Most entry-level programs take 3-9 months. Veterans with military welding or metalwork experience have significant advantages. Certified welders earn $40,000-$75,000, with specialized welders (pipeline, underwater, aerospace) earning $80,000-$150,000+. The skilled trades face severe worker shortages, creating exceptional opportunities.

## What Is AWS Welding Certification?

AWS (American Welding Society) offers multiple certification paths:

**Welder Performance Qualifications**:
- Structural Steel (AWS D1.1)
- Sheet Metal (AWS D9.1)
- Pipe Welding (API 1104, ASME Section IX)
- Various specialty codes

**AWS Professional Certifications**:
- Certified Welder (CW)
- Certified Welding Inspector (CWI)
- Certified Welding Educator (CWE)
- Certified Robotic Arc Welder (CRAW)
- Senior Certified Welding Inspector (SCWI)

**Common Welding Processes Tested**:
- SMAW (Stick/Arc Welding)
- GMAW (MIG Welding)
- FCAW (Flux-Core Arc Welding)
- GTAW (TIG Welding)

## Why Veterans Excel at Welding

Military experience provides strong preparation:

**Metalworking Experience**: Many MOSs involve welding, cutting, and metal fabrication.

**Precision and Attention to Detail**: Quality welds require the precision military training develops.

**Physical Endurance**: Welding is physically demanding—military fitness translates well.

**Safety Consciousness**: Military safety culture is essential for welding operations.

**Directly Related MOSs**:
- Army: 91E (Allied Trade Specialist), 44B (Metal Worker)
- Navy: HT (Hull Maintenance Technician), MR (Machinery Repairman)
- Air Force: 2A7X1 (Aircraft Metals Technology), 3E4X1 (Water/Fuel Systems)
- Marines: 1316 (Metal Worker), 2147 (Assault Amphibious Vehicle Technician)

Even non-welding MOSs with mechanical or maintenance experience adapt quickly.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

**Certification Testing Requirements**:
- No formal prerequisites for testing
- Must demonstrate skills through hands-on welding test
- Visual and destructive testing of welds

**Practical Requirements**:
- Training in specific welding processes
- Understanding of blueprints and welding symbols
- Safety knowledge
- Access to welding equipment for practice

**Military Welding Credit**: Some programs credit military welding training toward certifications.

## The Certification Tests: What to Expect

### AWS Certified Welder Program

**Test Process**:
1. Complete application with AWS
2. Perform welds under observation
3. Welds evaluated visually and/or destructively
4. Pass standards for specific code

**Common Test Types**:
- Plate tests (various positions: flat, horizontal, vertical, overhead)
- Pipe tests (various positions and diameters)
- Specific processes (SMAW, GMAW, FCAW, GTAW)

**Positions** (most valuable when certified in all):
- 1G/1F: Flat position
- 2G/2F: Horizontal position
- 3G/3F: Vertical position
- 4G/4F: Overhead position

### Tips for Testing

- Practice extensively in test positions before testing
- Understand the code requirements for your test
- Prepare welds slowly and carefully—speed isn't graded
- Ensure proper fit-up and settings before welding

4. **Ignoring Blueprint Reading**: Essential for fabrication work

5. **Neglecting Safety Training**: Required for most employment

6. **Not Joining AWS**: Membership provides resources and networking

7. **Underestimating Specialty Training**: Pipeline and underwater work require additional training

## Veteran Success Stories

**Staff Sergeant Marcus K., Army 91E → Pipeline Welder**
"Allied Trade Specialist in the Army gave me a foundation. GI Bill covered advanced pipe welding at Tulsa Welding School. Got certified in 6G (all position pipe) within 8 months. First pipeline job paid $85K. Traveling work isn't for everyone, but the money is incredible."

**Petty Officer Second Class Amanda T., Navy HT → Welding Inspector**
"Hull Tech experience was perfect preparation. Used VR&E for welding school and CWI training. Started as a structural welder at $52K. Moved into inspection—now earning $85K with better hours. The combination of welding skill and inspection certification is highly valued."
