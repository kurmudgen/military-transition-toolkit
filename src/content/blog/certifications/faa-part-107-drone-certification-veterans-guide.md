# FAA Part 107 Drone Pilot Certification for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate allows you to fly drones commercially. Exam costs $175 with total preparation of $200-$500. Most people prepare in 2-4 weeks. Veterans with aviation, surveillance, or technical backgrounds have significant advantages. Commercial drone pilots earn $40,000-$80,000 employed, with experienced operators and business owners reaching $75,000-$150,000+. One of the fastest-growing career fields with applications in construction, real estate, agriculture, inspection, and media.

## What Is Part 107 Certification?

The Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate allows commercial drone operations:

- Aerial photography and videography
- Real estate and construction documentation
- Agricultural surveys and mapping
- Infrastructure inspection
- Search and rescue support
- Surveying and mapping
- Media and film production

Without Part 107, you can only fly drones recreationally. Commercial operations require certification.

## Why Veterans Excel as Drone Pilots

Military experience provides exceptional preparation:

**Aviation Knowledge**: Military aviation background covers airspace and regulations.

**Surveillance Experience**: Reconnaissance and ISR directly applies.

**Technical Skills**: Operating complex equipment under pressure.

**Attention to Detail**: Pre-flight checklists and safety protocols.

**Relevant Experience**:
- Army: 15W (UAV Operator), Aviation MOSs
- Air Force: 1U0X1 (RPA Sensor Operator), RPA Pilots
- Navy/Marines: UAV operations
- All branches: Technical, aviation, or surveillance experience

**Advantage**: Military drone operators may have direct pathway—check with FAA for certificate conversion options.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

**Basic Requirements**:
- 16 years or older
- Read, speak, and understand English
- Be in physical and mental condition to safely operate
- Pass TSA security vetting (background check)

**No Flight Experience Required**: Part 107 tests knowledge, not flying skills.

**Military Pilots**: If you hold a current FAA pilot certificate (or military equivalent), you may qualify for expedited process.

## Veteran Success Story

**Sergeant Marcus T., Army 15W UAV Operator → Drone Services Owner**
"8 years flying military drones made Part 107 straightforward—passed with 95% in two weeks of study. Started with real estate photography at $150/shoot. Added construction documentation and roof inspections. Year one made $55K part-time while transitioning. Now full-time at $95K with two employees. Military UAS experience is exactly what clients trust."
