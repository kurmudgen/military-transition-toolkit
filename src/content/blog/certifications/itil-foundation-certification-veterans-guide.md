## Veteran Success Stories

**Master Sergeant (Ret.) Kevin P., Air Force 3D0X1 → IT Service Manager**
"20 years in Air Force IT meant I understood service delivery, but ITIL gave me the civilian vocabulary and framework. Studied for 3 weeks using Dion's course and passed first attempt. First job was $92K as an IT service manager for a defense contractor. ITIL plus my military IT experience was a winning combination."

**Petty Officer First Class Maria S., Navy IT → Service Delivery Manager**
"As an IT in the Navy, I ran help desks and managed incidents daily—but calling it 'ITIL' made employers take notice. Used TA to cover the certification while still active. Landed a $85K service desk manager role, and now manage service delivery at $115K."
