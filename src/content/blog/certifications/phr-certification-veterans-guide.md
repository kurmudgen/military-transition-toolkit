## Veteran Success Stories

**Staff Sergeant Michelle R., Army 42A → HR Manager**
"Six years as a Human Resources Specialist gave me all the experience I needed. PHR proved I understood civilian employment law, which was my knowledge gap. Studied 14 weeks focusing heavily on FLSA, FMLA, and employment regulations. First job was $65K as an HR specialist. Now managing HR at $92K for a manufacturing company."

**Petty Officer First Class David K., Navy PS → Senior HR Generalist**
"15 years as a Personnel Specialist—I knew personnel administration cold. PHR was about learning civilian-sector employment law. Used VR&E to cover the HRCI prep course. Started at $72K and now earn $88K. The PHR plus my Navy organizational experience made me a strong candidate."
