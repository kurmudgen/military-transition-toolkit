## Veteran Success Stories

**Master Sergeant (Ret.) Anthony B., Army 88N → Logistics Director**
"24 years as a Transportation Management Coordinator was exactly what civilian logistics needed. The CLTD gave me the credential to compete. Used VR&E to cover the training. First job was $95K managing distribution for a 3PL. Now I'm logistics director at $145K. My military experience managing global supply chains was my biggest asset."

**Gunnery Sergeant (Ret.) Patricia K., Marine 0431 → Transportation Manager**
