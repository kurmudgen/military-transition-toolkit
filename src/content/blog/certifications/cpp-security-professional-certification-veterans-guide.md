## Veteran Success Story

**Master Sergeant Robert K., Army 31B → Corporate Security Director**
"20 years as Military Police gave me the security foundation. Used GI Bill for criminal justice bachelor's, which reduced experience requirement. Studied 4 months using POA and ASIS review course. Passed CPP first attempt. Moved from security manager at $85K to director at $135K within 18 months. The CPP opened doors that experience alone couldn't."
