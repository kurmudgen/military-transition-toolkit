# CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional) for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) from APICS (now part of ASCM) is the leading certification for end-to-end supply chain management. The exam costs $575 for ASCM members ($780 non-members), with total preparation ranging from $1,000-$3,500. CSCP requires 3 years of supply chain experience or a bachelor's degree plus related experience. Most professionals prepare in 12-16 weeks. GI Bill covers supply chain training through approved programs. CSCP holders earn $80,000-$120,000, with senior roles exceeding $150,000.

## What Is CSCP?

The CSCP certification validates expertise in supply chain management from end to end—design, planning, execution, monitoring, and continuous improvement. CSCP covers:

- Supply chain design: Networks, globalization, sustainability
- Supply chain planning and execution: Demand planning, procurement, logistics
- Supply chain improvement and best practices: Risk management, technology, optimization

CSCP is recognized globally and valued by companies seeking supply chain professionals who understand the entire supply network, not just individual components.
