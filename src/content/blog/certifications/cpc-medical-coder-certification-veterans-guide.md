# CPC (Certified Professional Coder) for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

The Certified Professional Coder (CPC) credential from AAPC is the most recognized medical coding certification in healthcare. Total cost ranges from $1,500-$5,000 for training plus $399 for the exam. GI Bill covers accredited coding programs. Veterans with attention to detail and administrative experience excel at medical coding. CPCs earn $45,000-$65,000 with experienced coders reaching $70,000-$90,000. Remote work is common, making this excellent for veterans seeking flexibility. Strong job growth as healthcare documentation requirements increase.

## What Is CPC Certification?

The Certified Professional Coder (CPC) validates expertise in medical coding for physician office settings:

- Translating medical documentation into standardized codes
- Assigning CPT (procedure), ICD-10-CM (diagnosis), and HCPCS codes
- Ensuring accurate billing and reimbursement
- Understanding anatomy, medical terminology, and procedures
- Applying coding guidelines and compliance regulations
- Supporting healthcare revenue cycle management

CPC is awarded by AAPC (American Academy of Professional Coders), the largest medical coding organization with over 200,000 members.

## Why Veterans Excel at Medical Coding
