# OSHA 30-Hour Construction/General Industry for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

OSHA 30-Hour training is essential for supervisors and workers with safety responsibilities in construction and general industry. Training costs $50-$300 for online courses, or free through some veteran programs. The course takes 30 hours over 4-5 days (in-person) or self-paced (online). OSHA 30 is often required for construction supervisors and is mandatory on many job sites. Veterans with military safety experience are well-prepared for this training. Safety professionals earn $55,000-$100,000+, and OSHA 30 is a stepping stone to advanced safety certifications.

## What Is OSHA 30-Hour Training?

OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) 30-Hour training provides comprehensive safety education for workers with supervisory or safety responsibilities. Two versions exist:

**OSHA 30-Hour Construction**: Covers hazards specific to construction sites
- Fall protection
- Scaffolding
- Excavation
- Electrical
- Struck-by hazards
- Personal protective equipment

**OSHA 30-Hour General Industry**: Covers manufacturing, warehouse, and general workplace hazards
- Machine guarding
- Lockout/tagout
