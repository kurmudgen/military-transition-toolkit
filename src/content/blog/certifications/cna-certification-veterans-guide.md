# CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) Certification for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) is an entry-level healthcare credential that can be earned in just 4-12 weeks. Training costs $600-$2,500, and many programs are free through employers or workforce programs. GI Bill covers CNA programs, though using GI Bill for short programs may not be optimal—save it for nursing school. CNAs earn $28,000-$42,000, with opportunities to advance to LPN or RN. Healthcare desperately needs workers, creating excellent job security.

## What Is CNA Certification?

Certified Nursing Assistants provide direct patient care under nurse supervision:

- Assisting with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, eating)
- Taking vital signs
- Turning and repositioning patients
- Recording patient information
- Providing emotional support
- Assisting with medical procedures
- Transporting patients

CNA is often a stepping stone to nursing careers (LPN, RN, BSN).

## Why Veterans Excel as CNAs

Military experience provides strong preparation:

**Patient Care Training**: Military medics have extensive patient care experience.

**Discipline and Reliability**: Healthcare requires the consistency military training provides.

**Teamwork**: CNAs work closely with healthcare teams.

**Physical Stamina**: CNA work is physically demanding—veterans are prepared.

**Relevant Experience**:
- Army: 68W, 68C, 91A (health care specialists)
- Navy: HM (Hospital Corpsman)
- Air Force: 4N0X1 (Aerospace Medical Technician)
- Any military medical training

Even non-medical veterans succeed—CNA training is entry-level.
