# CompTIA A+ for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

CompTIA A+ is the foundational IT certification that validates your ability to perform core IT support tasks. It requires passing two exams (Core 1 and Core 2) costing $246 each ($492 total, or $246 with military discount). Most veterans complete preparation in 8-12 weeks. A+ is fully GI Bill eligible and meets DoD 8570 requirements for IAT Level I positions. This certification opens doors to help desk and IT support roles paying $40,000-$60,000, serving as the gateway to higher-paying IT careers.

## What Is CompTIA A+?

CompTIA A+ is the industry-standard entry-level IT certification, validating foundational IT skills across hardware, software, networking, security, and troubleshooting. It's considered the starting point for IT careers and is vendor-neutral, meaning skills apply to all major platforms and technologies.

The current certification (1100 series) consists of two exams:
- **Core 1 (220-1101)**: Hardware, networking, mobile devices, cloud computing, troubleshooting
- **Core 2 (220-1102)**: Operating systems, security, software troubleshooting, operational procedures

A+ is globally recognized with over 1.3 million certified professionals worldwide. It meets DoD 8570 requirements and is often required for government IT support positions.

## Why Veterans Excel at A+

Military service provides excellent preparation for IT support careers:

**Equipment Maintenance Experience**: Military personnel maintain complex equipment—translating to hardware troubleshooting skills.

**Technical Documentation**: Following and creating technical procedures is standard in military operations.

**Problem-Solving Under Pressure**: When systems fail, they need fixed now. Veterans understand urgency.

**Customer Service Skills**: Military members learn to work with diverse groups and provide clear communication.

**Relevant MOS/Ratings That Align**:
- Army: 25B (IT Specialist), 94F (Computer/Detection Systems Repairer)
- Navy: IT (Information Systems Technician), FC (Fire Controlman)
- Air Force: 3D0X1 (Knowledge Management), 3D1X1 (Client Systems)
- Marines: 0651 (Cyber Network Operator), 2847 (Electronics Maintenance Technician)
- Coast Guard: IT (Information Systems Technician)

Even non-technical MOSs benefit—many veterans successfully transition to IT through A+.

4. **Not Using Military Discount**: Save $246—register for military pricing

5. **Taking Both Exams Same Day**: Give yourself 2-3 weeks between exams

6. **Memorizing Without Understanding**: Know troubleshooting processes, not just answers

7. **Neglecting Performance-Based Questions**: Practice simulations and drag-and-drop questions

## Veteran Success Stories

**Specialist Carlos M., Army 11B (Infantry) → IT Support Specialist**
"I had zero IT experience coming out of the Army after 6 years as an Infantryman. A+ was my starting point. Studied 3 months using Professor Messer and Mike Meyers books. Failed Core 1 first attempt but passed both within 4 months. Started at $48K doing desktop support. Now making $72K as a systems admin with Security+ two years later."

**Petty Officer Third Class Tamika J., Navy YN → Help Desk Manager**
"As a Yeoman, I used computers daily but knew nothing about hardware. A+ taught me the fundamentals. Used VR&E to cover everything—training, exams, study materials. Got hired at $52K with a defense contractor. The clearance I maintained plus A+ was a powerful combination."
