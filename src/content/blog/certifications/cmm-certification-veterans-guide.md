## Veteran Success Stories

**Master Sergeant (Ret.) Carlos R., Army Motor Sergeant → Maintenance Director**
"20 years managing Army maintenance operations—from motor pools to division-level maintenance. CMM formalized what I'd done for two decades. Studied 8 weeks, passed first attempt. First civilian role was maintenance manager at $85K. Now directing maintenance for a manufacturing plant at $125K."

**Chief Petty Officer (Ret.) Patricia K., Navy MM → Facilities Manager**
"Leading Navy engineering maintenance departments translated perfectly. CMM gave me the civilian credential to match my experience. Started at $78K managing building maintenance for a healthcare system. Military experience in managing technicians and maintaining complex systems was exactly what they needed."
