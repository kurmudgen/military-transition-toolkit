# EMT-Basic Certification for Veterans: Your Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Emergency Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B) certification is the entry-level credential for pre-hospital emergency care. Training costs $1,000-$3,500 and takes 3-6 months. GI Bill covers EMT programs through approved institutions. Veterans with military medical or combat lifesaver experience have significant advantages. EMT-Basics earn $30,000-$45,000, with opportunities for advancement to Paramedic ($45,000-$70,000+). EMS faces staffing shortages nationwide, creating excellent job opportunities.

## What Is EMT-Basic Certification?

EMT-Basic (EMT-B) is the first level of EMS certification, authorizing you to provide basic emergency medical care and transportation. EMT-Basics can:

- Assess patient conditions
- Perform CPR and use AEDs
- Administer oxygen
- Control bleeding and treat shock
- Splint fractures and immobilize spinal injuries
- Assist patients with prescribed medications
- Transport patients to medical facilities

EMT certification is regulated by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) and state EMS offices.

## Veteran Success Stories

**Sergeant Marcus K., Army 68W Combat Medic → Flight Paramedic**

Started at an ambulance service at $35K, advanced to paramedic, now a flight paramedic at $72K. Military medical training is an incredible foundation."

**Petty Officer Third Class Jennifer T., Navy HM → Fire/EMT**
