## 1. UNDERSTANDING YOUR VA DECISION LETTER

**When you receive a VA decision letter, it will show:**

1. **Claims Granted** (service-connected)
   - Rating percentage for each condition
   - Effective date
   - Monthly compensation amount

2. **Claims Denied** (not service-connected)
   - Reason for denial
   - What evidence was lacking

3. **Deferred Claims** (need more evidence/exams)
   - What's pending
   - What VA needs from you

---

### **READING YOUR DECISION LETTER**

**Look for these sections:**

**"DENIED"**
- Condition not found to be service-connected
- Common reasons:
  - No nexus (not connected to military service)
  - Insufficient evidence
  - No in-service diagnosis or treatment

**"GRANTED at [X]%"**
- You're service-connected but may have gotten a lower rating than deserved
- Example: "Granted PTSD at 30%" when you believe you deserve 70%

**"EFFECTIVE DATE"**
- The date VA starts paying you
- Usually your claim filing date (you get back pay)
- Early effective date = more back pay

---

### **WHY APPEALING MATTERS**

**The financial impact of a successful appeal:**

**Example 1: PTSD Appeal**
- Denied → Approved at 70%
- 70% PTSD = $1,800/month
- **Gain: $21,600/year ($648,000 over 30 years)**

**Example 2: Rating Increase Appeal**
- Granted at 30% → Increased to 70%
- Difference: $1,200/month
- **Gain: $14,400/year ($432,000 over 30 years)**

**Example 3: Effective Date Appeal**
- Effective date: June 2024 → Changed to June 2023
- Back pay: 12 months × $1,000/month
- **Gain: $12,000 immediate**

**Bottom Line: Appeals are worth it.**

---

## 2. THE 3 APPEAL PATHWAYS EXPLAINED

**As of February 2019, the VA Appeals Modernization Act created 3 appeal paths:**

1. **Higher-Level Review (HLR)**
2. **Supplemental Claim**
3. **Board Appeal**

**You have 1 YEAR from your decision letter date to file an appeal.**

---

### **QUICK COMPARISON**

| Factor | HLR | Supplemental Claim | Board Appeal |
|--------|-----|-------------------|--------------|
| **Can submit new evidence?** | NO | YES | YES |
| **Timeline** | 4-5 months | 4-6 months (or longer) | 1-3 years |
| **Who reviews?** | Senior VA rater | New VA rater | Veterans Law Judge |
| **Hearing option?** | NO | NO | YES (optional) |
| **Best for** | VA made an obvious error | You have new evidence | Everything else failed |
| **Success rate** | ~25-35% | ~40-50% | ~30-40% (varies by issue) |

**You can ONLY choose ONE path initially. Choose wisely.**

---

## 3. HIGHER-LEVEL REVIEW (HLR): FAST TRACK APPEAL

**What it is:**
A senior VA rater reviews your claim to determine if the original rater made an error.

---

### **HOW HLR WORKS**

**Who reviews:** A senior VA rater (higher rank than original rater)

**What they review:** The EXACT same evidence from your original claim—nothing new

**What they're looking for:**
- Did the original rater make a factual error?
- Did the rater misinterpret the evidence?
- Did the rater apply the wrong VA rating criteria?
- Did the rater ignore evidence in the file?

**Timeline:** 125 days (target) = 4 months average

**No new evidence allowed.** If you submit new evidence, VA will return it and treat your HLR as a Supplemental Claim instead.

---

### **WHEN TO CHOOSE HLR**

✅ **Choose HLR if:**
- You believe the VA rater made an obvious error
- You think the rater misread your medical records
- The rater applied the wrong rating criteria (e.g., rated you under the wrong body system)
- The rater ignored evidence that was already in your file
- You want a fast decision (4-5 months vs. 1-3 years for Board)
- You DON'T have new medical evidence to submit

**Example scenarios where HLR works:**

**Scenario 1:** You submitted a nexus letter from a doctor, but the decision letter doesn't mention it at all. The rater may have missed it.

**Scenario 2:** You were rated for knee pain under the wrong CFR code. The rater used a general orthopedic code instead of the specific knee condition code, which would give you a higher rating.

**Scenario 3:** Your C&P examiner said you have 30 degrees of forward flexion (lumbar spine), which should be 30%, but the rater gave you 10%. Math error.

---

### **HOW TO FILE AN HLR**

**Form:** VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review)

**Where to file:**
- Online: VA.gov (fastest)
- Mail: Send to address on the form (varies by claim type)
- In person: Regional VA office

**What to include:**
- The decision you're appealing (decision letter date)
- Which issues you want reviewed (you can appeal some issues and not others)
- Whether you want an informal conference (optional phone call with senior rater)

**Informal Conference:**
You can request a phone call with the senior rater to explain why you think there was an error. This is your chance to point out what the original rater missed.

**Do you need it?** Optional, but recommended if the error isn't obvious.

---

### **HLR OUTCOMES**

**3 possible outcomes:**

1. **Decision changed in your favor**
   - Rating increased or claim granted
   - You receive back pay to original decision date
   - **You win**

2. **Decision upheld (no change)**
   - Senior rater agrees with original rater
   - Rating stays the same
   - **Next step:** File Supplemental Claim (if you have new evidence) OR Board Appeal

3. **Decision changed against you (rare)**
   - Rating decreased (very rare, but possible)
   - VA must provide notice and opportunity to provide evidence before reducing

---

### **PROS & CONS OF HLR**

**Pros:**
✓ Fast (4-5 months average)
✓ No new evidence needed (good if you don't have any)
✓ Can correct obvious errors quickly
✓ Informal conference option

**Cons:**
⚠ Can't submit new evidence (limited scope)
⚠ Lower success rate if error isn't clear
⚠ If denied, you've used up 4-5 months

---

## 4. SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM: THE EVIDENCE ROUTE

**What it is:**
You submit NEW evidence and the VA re-adjudicates your claim.

---

### **HOW SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIMS WORK**

**Who reviews:** A NEW VA rater (different from the original one)

**What they review:**
- All original evidence, PLUS
- New and relevant evidence you submit

**What counts as "new and relevant" evidence:**
- New medical records (doctor visits, tests, diagnoses since original decision)
- Nexus letters from doctors
- Buddy statements you didn't submit before
- Service records you just obtained
- New C&P exam results
- IMO (Independent Medical Opinion)
- Any evidence that wasn't in your original claim file

**Timeline:**
- 4-6 months average (same as original claim)
- Can be faster or slower depending on evidence complexity

---

### **WHEN TO CHOOSE SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM**

✅ **Choose Supplemental Claim if:**
- You have new medical evidence
- You didn't submit all available evidence with original claim
- You've been diagnosed with a new condition since filing (secondary claim)
- You have a new nexus letter from a doctor
- Your condition has worsened and you have medical evidence
- You believe the original decision was wrong AND you have evidence to prove it

**Example scenarios:**

**Scenario 1 (New Medical Evidence):**
Your PTSD claim was denied due to "insufficient evidence of current diagnosis." Since then, you've been diagnosed with PTSD by a private psychiatrist and you have treatment records. **File Supplemental Claim with the new diagnosis and records.**

**Scenario 2 (Nexus Letter):**
Your back pain claim was denied for "lack of nexus" (not connected to service). You get a nexus letter from a doctor stating your back pain is "at least as likely as not" related to your service. **File Supplemental Claim with nexus letter.**

**Scenario 3 (Worsening Condition):**
You were granted 10% for knee pain. Your knee has gotten significantly worse—you now need a brace, can't run, and have constant pain. You have new X-rays showing arthritis. **File Supplemental Claim for increase with new X-rays and medical records.**

---

### **WHAT QUALIFIES AS "NEW AND RELEVANT" EVIDENCE**

**NEW = Wasn't in your original claim file**

Examples of NEW evidence:
- Medical records dated after your original claim
- Nexus letter from a doctor dated after the decision
- Buddy statement you didn't submit before
- Service treatment records you just obtained through FOIA
- New C&P exam from private doctor

**RELEVANT = Tends to prove your claim**

Examples of RELEVANT evidence:
- Doctor's diagnosis of the condition you claimed
- Medical opinion linking condition to service
- Evidence showing severity of symptoms
- Records showing treatment and medication

**NOT new and relevant:**
- Evidence that was already in your file (VA will point this out and may deny)
- Evidence unrelated to your condition (e.g., submitting heart records for a knee claim)
- General statements without medical backing

---

### **HOW TO FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM**

**Form:** VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim)

**Where to file:**
- Online: VA.gov
- Mail: Regional VA office
- In person: Regional VA office

**What to include:**
1. The decision you're appealing (decision letter date)
2. Which issues you're appealing
3. **NEW EVIDENCE** - Critical! You must submit new evidence or VA will deny immediately
4. Statement explaining what the new evidence is and why it's relevant

**Evidence submission:**
- Upload with your online claim
- Mail separately to the address on the form
- Bring in person to VA regional office

**TIP:** Always include a cover letter explaining what new evidence you're submitting and why it proves your claim.

---

### **SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM OUTCOMES**

**3 possible outcomes:**

1. **Claim granted or rating increased**
   - You win!
   - Effective date = date you filed the Supplemental Claim (usually)
   - Back pay from that date

2. **Claim denied again**
   - VA reviewed new evidence and still denied
   - **Next step:** File another Supplemental Claim (if you have more evidence) OR file Board Appeal

3. **Deferred** (need more info)
   - VA orders another C&P exam
   - VA requests more records
   - Decision delayed

---

### **PROS & CONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM**

**Pros:**
✓ Can submit new evidence (most powerful option if you have evidence)
✓ Fresh look by new rater
✓ Relatively fast (4-6 months)
✓ Higher success rate if you have strong new evidence (40-50%)
✓ Can file multiple Supplemental Claims (no limit)

**Cons:**
⚠ MUST have new evidence (can't just resubmit same stuff)
⚠ Effective date = date of Supplemental Claim (not original claim date)
  - You lose back pay from original claim date
  - **This is the biggest downside**
⚠ Takes time to gather new evidence

---

## 5. BOARD APPEAL: THE NUCLEAR OPTION

**What it is:**
Your case goes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) where a Veterans Law Judge makes the final decision.

---

### **HOW BOARD APPEALS WORK**

**Who decides:** A Veterans Law Judge (attorney employed by VA)

**What they review:**
- All evidence in your file
- New evidence (if you choose certain lanes)
- Your arguments for why VA got it wrong

**Timeline:**
- **Direct Review:** 1 year average
- **Evidence Submission:** 1-2 years
- **Hearing:** 2-3 years

**This is the longest option, but also your final shot within the VA system.**

---

### **3 BOARD APPEAL "DOCKETS" (LANES)**

When you file a Board Appeal, you must choose one of 3 lanes:

---

### **DOCKET 1: DIRECT REVIEW**

**What it is:** Judge reviews the evidence already in your file. No new evidence, no hearing.

**Timeline:** Fastest (1 year average)

**When to choose:**
- You believe VA incorrectly applied the law to the facts
- You believe the evidence in the file clearly supports your claim
- You don't have new evidence
- You want a faster decision

**Example:**
Your C&P exam shows 40 degrees of limited range of motion in your knee, which under 38 CFR 4.71a qualifies for 20%, but VA rated you 10%. The evidence is there—VA just applied the wrong rating.

---

### **DOCKET 2: EVIDENCE SUBMISSION**

**What it is:** You submit new evidence within 90 days, then judge reviews everything.

**Timeline:** 1-2 years

**When to choose:**
- You have new evidence to submit
- You don't want a hearing
- You want a decision within 1-2 years

**Evidence deadline:** Must submit within 90 days of Board receiving your appeal.

**Example:**
Your PTSD claim was denied. You now have a nexus letter from a psychiatrist and new treatment records. You submit these to the Board and the judge reviews everything.

---

### **DOCKET 3: HEARING**

**What it is:** You get a hearing (in-person, video, or phone) with a Veterans Law Judge where you (or your representative) argue your case.

**Timeline:** 2-3 years (slowest)

**Types of hearings:**
- **Video conference hearing** (most common) - You go to local VA office, judge is via video
- **Board hearing** (Washington DC) - Travel to DC, appear in person
- **Tele-hearing** - Phone call with judge

**When to choose:**
- Your case is complex and needs explanation
- You have a representative (VSO or attorney) who will argue for you
- You're willing to wait 2-3 years
- Personal testimony will help (e.g., describing how PTSD affects your life)

**What happens at hearing:**
- Judge asks you questions
- Your representative presents arguments
- You can submit new evidence
- Judge issues decision weeks or months later

---

### **BOARD APPEAL OUTCOMES**

**5 possible outcomes:**

1. **Granted (Allowed)**
   - VA's decision is overturned
   - You're granted service connection or higher rating
   - **You win!**
   - Effective date = original claim date (you get back pay from the start!)

2. **Remanded**
   - Judge sends claim back to VA regional office for more development
   - VA must get more evidence, order new C&P exam, etc.
   - Then VA decides again
   - **Common outcome (40%+ of Board decisions)**

3. **Denied**
   - Board upholds VA's decision
   - You lose
   - **Next step:** Appeal to Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) - federal court

4. **Withdrawn**
   - You withdraw your appeal before decision

5. **Dismissed**
   - Board determines appeal wasn't properly filed or is untimely

---

### **PROS & CONS OF BOARD APPEAL**

**Pros:**
✓ Independent review by a judge (not VA rater)
✓ If you win, effective date goes back to ORIGINAL claim date (maximum back pay)
✓ Option for hearing to argue your case
✓ Can submit new evidence (in Evidence or Hearing lanes)
✓ Final decision within VA system

**Cons:**
⚠ VERY LONG wait (1-3 years)
⚠ No guarantee of success (30-40% win rate depending on issue)
⚠ Many cases are remanded (sent back to start over)
⚠ If you lose, your only option is federal court (expensive, need attorney)

---

## 6. DECISION TREE: WHICH APPEAL PATH TO CHOOSE

**START HERE: Did VA make an obvious error?**

→ **YES** (rater ignored evidence, used wrong rating code, math error)
  - **File HLR** (fast, can fix clear errors)

→ **NO** (VA considered all evidence, just disaged with your claim)
  - **Continue below**

---

**Do you have NEW medical evidence?**

→ **YES** (new records, nexus letter, diagnosis, treatment since original claim)
  - **File Supplemental Claim**
  - **Downside:** Effective date resets (lose back pay to original claim date)

→ **NO** (no new evidence)
  - **Continue below**

---

**How important is the back pay to you?**

→ **VERY IMPORTANT** (I need back pay from my original claim date)
  - **File Board Appeal** (only way to preserve original effective date)
  - **Downside:** 1-3 year wait

→ **NOT CRITICAL** (I just want a decision ASAP)
  - **File HLR or gather new evidence for Supplemental Claim**

---

**Have you already tried HLR and/or Supplemental Claim?**

→ **YES** (both failed, still denied or low rating)
  - **File Board Appeal** (your last option within VA)

→ **NO**
  - **Start with HLR or Supplemental Claim first** (faster, less complex)

---

## 7. SUCCESS RATES BY APPEAL TYPE

**Based on VA data (2023):**

### **HIGHER-LEVEL REVIEW**
- **Fully granted:** 15-20%
- **Partially granted:** 10-15%
- **Denied:** 65-70%
- **Total favorable:** 25-35%

**Why lower success rate:** HLR only works if there's a clear error. Most denials aren't due to clear errors—they're due to lack of evidence.

---

### **SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM**
- **Fully granted:** 25-35%
- **Partially granted:** 15-20%
- **Denied:** 45-60%
- **Total favorable:** 40-55%

**Why higher success rate:** New evidence can fill gaps from original claim. If your new evidence is strong (nexus letter, diagnosis), success rate is much higher (60%+).

---

### **BOARD APPEAL**
- **Allowed (granted):** 15-25%
- **Remanded (sent back to VA):** 40-50%
- **Denied:** 30-40%

**Why so many remands:** Judges find VA didn't properly develop the claim and send it back for more evidence/exams.

**Effective success rate:** If you count remands as a second chance, eventual success rate is higher (~40-50% after remand).

---

### **FACTORS THAT INCREASE SUCCESS**

✅ **Strong medical evidence** (diagnoses, nexus letters, IMOs)
✅ **Buddy statements** from fellow service members or family
✅ **Clear service connection** (in-service event documented)
✅ **Representation** (VSO or attorney)
✅ **Persistence** (don't give up after first denial)

---

## 8. TIMELINE COMPARISON

**How long each appeal path takes:**

| Appeal Type | Average Timeline | Range |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Higher-Level Review** | 4-5 months | 3-8 months |
| **Supplemental Claim** | 4-6 months | 3-12 months |
| **Board Appeal - Direct Review** | 1 year | 8-18 months |
| **Board Appeal - Evidence** | 1.5-2 years | 1-3 years |
| **Board Appeal - Hearing** | 2-3 years | 1.5-4 years |
| **Court Appeal (CAVC)** | 1-2 years | 6 months-3 years |

**Total time if you exhaust all options:**

Original Claim → Denied (6 months)
→ HLR → Denied (+ 5 months)
→ Supplemental Claim → Denied (+ 6 months)
→ Board Appeal → Remanded (+ 2 years)
→ VA Redecides → Denied (+ 6 months)
→ Board Appeal Again → Denied (+ 2 years)
→ Court Appeal → Decision (+ 2 years)

**Total: 7-8 years** (This is extreme, but it happens)

---

## 9. WHEN TO HIRE A VSO VS. ATTORNEY

**You have 3 options for representation:**

1. **Do it yourself** (free)
2. **Hire a Veterans Service Officer (VSO)** (free)
3. **Hire an attorney** ($$$)

---

### **VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS (VSOs) - FREE**

**Who they are:**
- DAV (Disabled American Veterans)
- VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars)
- American Legion
- AMVETS
- Paralyzed Veterans of America

**What they do:**
- Help you file claims and appeals
- Represent you at Board hearings
- **100% FREE** (no fees ever)

**Pros:**
✓ Free
✓ Experienced with VA system
✓ Can represent you at Board hearings
✓ Help with paperwork

**Cons:**
⚠ Overworked (handle hundreds of cases)
⚠ May not be as aggressive as attorney
⚠ Can't take your case to federal court (CAVC)

**When to use VSO:**
- Initial claims
- HLR or Supplemental Claims
- Board Appeals (Direct or Evidence lanes)
- You can't afford an attorney

---

### **ACCREDITED ATTORNEYS - $$$$**

**Who they are:**
- Lawyers who specialize in VA disability law
- Must be accredited by VA

**What they do:**
- Handle complex appeals
- Represent you at Board hearings
- Can take case to federal court (CAVC)

**Cost:**
- Contingency fee: 20-33% of past-due benefits (back pay)
- Example: You win $50,000 back pay, attorney takes $10,000-$16,500
- **NO upfront cost** (you only pay if you win)
- **Cannot charge for initial claims or HLR/Supplemental Claims** (VA regulation)
- Can only charge for Board Appeals and court appeals

**Pros:**
✓ More aggressive advocacy
✓ Specializes in VA law
✓ Can appeal to federal court
✓ Only pay if you win

**Cons:**
⚠ Takes 20-33% of your back pay
⚠ May not take your case if it's weak or low-value

**When to hire attorney:**
- Complex case (multiple denied appeals)
- High value (substantial back pay at stake)
- Board Appeal (especially Hearing lane)
- Court appeal (CAVC)
- VSO has failed to win your case

---

### **WHICH TO CHOOSE?**

**Use VSO if:**
- First appeal (HLR or Supplemental Claim)
- Your case is straightforward
- You can't afford to lose 20-33% of back pay

**Hire attorney if:**
- Your case is going to Board
- VSO efforts have failed
- You have a complex legal issue
- High back pay is at stake ($30K+)

**Many veterans start with VSO, then hire attorney if it goes to Board.**

---

## 10. FILING YOUR APPEAL: STEP-BY-STEP

### **STEP 1: RECEIVE DECISION LETTER**

□ Read entire letter carefully
□ Note the decision date (you have 1 year from this date to appeal)
□ Identify which claims were denied or rated too low
□ Understand the reason for denial

---

### **STEP 2: GATHER EVIDENCE (if filing Supplemental Claim)**

□ Request all VA medical records
□ Get private medical records
□ Obtain nexus letter or IMO if needed
□ Collect buddy statements
□ Get service treatment records (if you don't have them)

**Allow 2-3 months for this step.**

---

### **STEP 3: DECIDE WHICH APPEAL PATH**

Use decision tree (Section 6):
□ HLR (if clear error, no new evidence needed)
□ Supplemental Claim (if you have new evidence)
□ Board Appeal (if both above failed or back pay critical)

---

### **STEP 4: COMPLETE THE FORM**

**HLR:** VA Form 20-0996
**Supplemental Claim:** VA Form 20-0995
**Board Appeal:** VA Form 10182

**Fill out:**
□ Your personal info
□ Decision date you're appealing
□ Issues you're appealing (can select some, not all)
□ (For Board) Which docket: Direct, Evidence, or Hearing

---

### **STEP 5: SUBMIT**

**Online (fastest):**
- VA.gov → File a claim → Decision Review
- Upload form and evidence

**Mail:**
- Mail to address listed on form (varies by appeal type and region)

**In person:**
- Bring to VA regional office

**Confirmation:**
□ Save confirmation number (online)
□ Get receipt (in person)
□ Send certified mail (if mailing)

---

### **STEP 6: WAIT**

**HLR:** 4-5 months
**Supplemental Claim:** 4-6 months
**Board Appeal:** 1-3 years

**You can check status:**
- VA.gov → Track your claim
- Call 1-800-827-1000
- eBenefits (older system)

---

### **STEP 7: RECEIVE DECISION**

**If favorable:**
✓ Rating increased or claim granted
✓ Receive back pay (deposited within 15 days usually)
✓ Monthly compensation starts immediately

**If denied:**
□ Review decision letter
□ Decide next step: File another appeal or accept decision

---

## 11. COMMON APPEAL MISTAKES

### **MISTAKE #1: Missing the 1-Year Deadline**

**The rule:** You have 1 year from your decision letter date to file an appeal.

**What happens if you miss it:**
- Your appeal will be denied as untimely
- You can file a new claim, but effective date = new filing date (you lose years of back pay)

**Solution:** Mark your calendar. Set reminders. Don't wait.

---

### **MISTAKE #2: Filing the Wrong Appeal Type**

**Example:** Filing HLR when you have new evidence
- If you submit new evidence with HLR, VA will convert it to Supplemental Claim
- This delays your appeal and resets effective date

**Solution:** Use decision tree (Section 6) to choose correct path.

---

### **MISTAKE #3: Not Submitting New Evidence with Supplemental Claim**

**The rule:** Supplemental Claims REQUIRE new and relevant evidence.

**What happens:**
- VA will deny your claim immediately if you don't include new evidence
- You waste 4-6 months

**Solution:** Always include new evidence AND explain what it is in a cover letter.

---

### **MISTAKE #4: Appealing Everything**

**Problem:** You appeal every single issue even if some were rated fairly.

**Why it's bad:**
- VA can reduce ratings on appeal (rare but possible)
- Wastes time and effort on issues you can't win

**Solution:** Only appeal the issues where you have a good argument or new evidence.

---

### **MISTAKE #5: Not Getting Help**

**Problem:** Trying to navigate complex appeals alone.

**Why it's bad:**
- Appeals are more complex than initial claims
- Representation increases success rate
- VSOs are free!

**Solution:** Get a VSO or attorney to represent you.

Dear VA Claims Processor,

I am filing a Supplemental Claim to appeal the decision dated [date] in which my claim for service connection for [condition] was denied.

I am submitting the following NEW AND RELEVANT EVIDENCE:

1. Nexus Letter from Dr. [Name], dated [date], establishing a medical link between my [condition] and my military service. Dr. [Name] states that my condition is "at least as likely as not" related to my service.

2. Medical records from [Clinic Name] dated [date range], showing ongoing treatment for [condition] and diagnosis by Dr. [Name].

3. Buddy statement from [Name], dated [date], who served with me and witnessed the in-service event that caused my condition.

This new evidence was not available at the time of my original claim and directly addresses the VA's reason for denial: "lack of medical nexus."

I respectfully request that the VA review my claim with this new evidence and grant service connection for [condition].

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
[Your Name]

## LANDING PAGE COPY

**Headline:** VA Appeal Strategy Workbook: HLR vs. Supplemental vs. Board Appeal - Which Path Gets You the Rating You Deserve?

**Subheadline:** Your VA claim was denied or rated too low. You have 1 year to appeal and 3 paths to choose from: Higher-Level Review (4 months), Supplemental Claim (6 months + new evidence), or Board Appeal (1-3 years but preserves back pay). Choosing the WRONG path could cost you tens of thousands in back pay. This guide shows you exactly which appeal to file based on your situation.

**3 Bullets:**
✓ Use the appeal decision tree: Get step-by-step guidance on whether to file HLR (VA made an error), Supplemental Claim (you have new evidence), or Board Appeal (everything else failed)
✓ Understand the timelines and success rates: HLR = 25-35% success in 4 months, Supplemental = 40-55% in 6 months, Board = 30-40% in 1-3 years (but full back pay if you win)
✓ Know when to hire a VSO vs. attorney: VSOs are free and handle 90% of cases, but attorneys (20-33% fee) are worth it for complex Board Appeals with $30K+ back pay

**Social Proof:**
"My PTSD claim was denied. I used this guide's decision tree—I had a new nexus letter so I filed a Supplemental Claim. Six months later, approved at 70%. That's $1,800/month for life."
