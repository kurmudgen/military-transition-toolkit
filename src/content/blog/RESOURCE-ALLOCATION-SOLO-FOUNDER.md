## Outsourcing Strategy

### What to Outsource (Priority Order)

**Month 1: Do Everything Yourself**

- Build foundation
- Don't outsource yet (too early, too expensive)

**Month 2: Outsource Low-Value, Time-Consuming Tasks**

**Priority 1: Video Editing** ($25-$50/video)
- **Why**: Takes 1-2 hours/video, low skill ceiling for you
- **ROI**: Reclaim 4-8 hours/week, use for higher-value work
- **How**: Hire on Fiverr/Upwork, send raw footage + instructions

**Priority 2: Graphic Design** ($50-$100/batch)
- **Why**: Social media graphics, thumbnails, lead magnet covers take 1-2 hours
- **ROI**: Reclaim 2-3 hours/week
- **How**: Hire designer on 99designs, Fiverr, or Upwork

**Month 3: Outsource More to Scale**

**Priority 3: Virtual Assistant** ($25/hr, 10-20 hours/month)

  - Transcribe podcast episodes
  - Research partnership prospects
- **How**: Hire on Belay, Fancy Hands, or Upwork

  - Give detailed brief
  - Provide outline + resources
  - Edit for voice and accuracy

---

### What NOT to Outsource (Keep In-House)

❌ **Strategy & Planning**
- You must own the vision
- No one knows your users better than you
- Outsourcing this = losing control

❌ **Customer Conversations** (at least early on)
- Talk to users (trials, paid, churned)
- Learn their pain points
- Inform product roadmap
- Month 6+: Delegate some support, but stay close to users

❌ **Partnership Sales** (Month 1-3)
- You are the best salesperson for your product
- Partners want to talk to the founder
- Build relationships personally
- Month 6+: Consider hiring sales rep

❌ **Core Product Development** (early on)
- You need to understand the product deeply
- Outsourcing too early = technical debt
- Month 6+: Consider hiring developer, but you stay technical

## Energy Management

### The Solo Founder's Dilemma

**Problem**: Limited time + limited energy = burnout risk

**Solution**: Manage energy, not just time

---

### Energy Allocation Framework

**High-Energy Tasks** (Do when fresh - mornings, weekends):
- Strategic planning
- Content creation (writing, recording)
- Partnership calls/demos
- Product development
- Complex problem-solving

**Medium-Energy Tasks** (Do midday):
- Publishing content
- Email campaigns
- Analytics review
- Social media engagement

**Low-Energy Tasks** (Do when tired - evenings, after long work day):
- Administrative work
- Scheduling
- Responding to emails
- Data entry
- Reviewing metrics (not analyzing, just checking)

---

### Preventing Burnout

**Weekly Non-Negotiables**:
- [ ] 1 full day off (no work, no business thinking)
- [ ] 7-8 hours sleep (non-negotiable)
- [ ] Exercise 3-4x/week (even if 20 minutes)
- [ ] Social time (don't isolate)

**Monthly Reset**:
- [ ] Review what's working / what's not
- [ ] Cut tasks that don't move the needle
- [ ] Celebrate wins (even small ones)
- [ ] Reassess: Are you enjoying this? If not, what needs to change?

**Quarterly Break**:
- [ ] Take 3-4 days completely off every quarter
- [ ] Disconnect from business
- [ ] Recharge

**The Goal**: Sustainable pace for 12-24 months, not sprint for 90 days then burnout

## Conclusion: Work Smarter, Not Harder

**The Reality**: You can't outwork your competition as a solo founder with a full-time job.

**The Solution**: Out-execute through:
1. **Ruthless prioritization** (focus on 20% of tasks that drive 80% of results)
2. **Systematic automation** (reclaim 10-15 hours/week)
3. **Strategic outsourcing** (buy back your time for $25-$50/hour)
4. **Energy management** (sustainable pace beats burnout)

**The Goal**: Build a $5K-$10K MRR business in 90 days while maintaining your sanity, relationships, and health.

**It's possible. Thousands of solo founders have done it. You can too.**
