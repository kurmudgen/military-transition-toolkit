# VA Fully Developed Claims: Get Faster Decisions (Complete Guide)

## Bottom Line Up Front

A **Fully Developed Claim (FDC)** is a VA disability claim submitted with all required evidence upfront. Instead of the VA gathering evidence for you (which takes months), you provide everything. Result: **Faster decisions**—often 30-60 days faster than standard claims. FDC is the preferred method for veterans who have their evidence ready. If you can gather your records, an FDC gets you paid sooner.

## What Is a Fully Developed Claim?

A Fully Developed Claim is exactly what it sounds like: a claim that's complete when submitted.

**Standard Claim:**
- You submit basic information
- VA requests your medical records
- VA schedules C&P exam
- VA gathers any other evidence
- VA makes decision
- Timeline: 4-12+ months

**Fully Developed Claim:**
- You submit all evidence (service records, medical records, statements)
- VA schedules C&P exam (only step they handle)
- VA makes decision
- Timeline: 2-4 months (typically)

The FDC program rewards veterans who do the legwork by processing their claims faster.

## FDC Requirements

To file a Fully Developed Claim, you must submit:

### 1. All Relevant Medical Evidence

**VA treatment records:**
- Request from the VA (they'll pull these automatically if you've received VA care)
- Or submit copies yourself

**Private medical records:**
- Any civilian doctors, specialists, hospitals
- Diagnosis documentation
- Treatment records
- Test results (X-rays, MRIs, lab work)

**Service treatment records:**
- If not already in your VA file
- Personnel records if relevant

### 2. Supporting Statements

**Personal statement:**
- Your description of the condition
- How it's connected to service
- How it affects your life

**Buddy statements:**
- Statements from fellow service members
- Statements from family who observe your condition

### 3. Any Nexus Evidence

**For claims requiring medical nexus:**
- Private medical opinions
- Nexus letters
- Medical literature supporting connection

### 4. Certification

You must certify that:
- You have no more evidence to submit
- You've identified all sources of evidence
- You understand the VA will schedule a C&P exam

## Benefits of Filing FDC

### 1. Faster Processing

FDC claims average **30-60 days faster** than standard claims. Some are decided in weeks.

**Why:** The VA doesn't spend months requesting records that never arrive or chasing down evidence.

### 2. Earlier Effective Date

Faster decision = earlier benefits start date (assuming you filed an Intent to File).

### 3. Priority Processing

FDC claims are routed to dedicated teams focused on complete claims.

### 4. Fewer Delays

Standard claims often stall waiting for:
- Medical facilities to respond to records requests
- Evidence that the veteran forgot to mention
- Clarification on missing information

FDC claims have everything upfront.

## Who Should File an FDC

**FDC is ideal if you:**
- Have all your medical records
- Have a clear diagnosis
- Have evidence of service connection
- Want faster processing
- Are organized and prepared

**Standard claim may be better if you:**
- Don't have access to your records
- Need help gathering evidence
- Have complex claims requiring extensive development
- Are unsure what evidence exists

## How to File a Fully Developed Claim

### Step 1: Gather All Evidence

Before filing, collect:

**Medical evidence:**
- [ ] VA medical records (or authorize VA to retrieve)
- [ ] Private medical records
- [ ] Specialist records
- [ ] Hospital records
- [ ] Diagnostic test results
- [ ] Prescription history

**Service records:**
- [ ] Service treatment records
- [ ] Personnel records
- [ ] DD-214

**Supporting documents:**
- [ ] Personal statement
- [ ] Buddy statements
- [ ] Nexus letters (if applicable)
- [ ] Photos (for visible conditions)
- [ ] Medical literature (for secondary claims)

### Step 2: Organize Your Evidence

Create a clear, organized package:

1. Cover page listing all conditions claimed
2. Evidence organized by condition
3. Index or table of contents for complex claims
4. Clear labels on each document

### Step 3: File on VA.gov

1. Go to [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)
2. Sign in
3. Navigate to "File a disability claim"
4. Select "Fully Developed Claim" option
5. Upload all evidence
6. Certify that you've submitted everything
7. Submit

### Step 4: Attend C&P Exam

Even with FDC, the VA typically schedules a C&P exam to verify your condition. Prepare for it like any other C&P exam.

### Step 5: Wait for Decision

FDC decisions typically arrive within 2-4 months, though times vary.

## Evidence Checklist by Claim Type

### Initial Disability Claim

- [ ] Service treatment records showing in-service event
- [ ] Current medical records showing diagnosis
- [ ] Personal statement explaining connection
- [ ] Buddy statements supporting in-service event
- [ ] Nexus letter (recommended)

### Increase Claim

- [ ] Recent medical records showing worsened condition
- [ ] Previous rating decision
- [ ] Personal statement describing worsening
- [ ] Documentation of increased treatment

### Secondary Claim

- [ ] Documentation of primary service-connected condition
- [ ] Medical records showing secondary condition
- [ ] Nexus letter linking conditions
- [ ] Medical literature supporting connection

## Common FDC Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Missing Evidence

If you claim FDC but are missing key evidence, the VA may:
- Convert your claim to standard (slower processing)
- Deny the claim for insufficient evidence

**Fix:** Don't file FDC until you truly have everything.

### Mistake 2: Claiming FDC Without Checking Records

Some veterans file FDC without reviewing their records first. If records don't support your claim, you find out at denial.

**Fix:** Review all records before filing. Ensure they document what you're claiming.

### Mistake 3: Not Including Private Records

VA can only automatically retrieve VA records. Private records must be submitted by you.

**Fix:** Request records from all private providers and include them.

### Mistake 4: Poor Organization

Dumping 500 pages of unsorted documents makes the rater's job harder and may result in overlooked evidence.

**Fix:** Organize, label, and index your evidence.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Personal Statement

Medical records show what; personal statements explain how and why. Both matter.

**Fix:** Always include a detailed personal statement.

## FDC vs. Standard Claim Comparison

| Factor | FDC | Standard Claim |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| Who gathers evidence | You | VA |
| Processing time | 2-4 months | 4-12+ months |
| Control over evidence | High | Lower |
| Best for | Prepared veterans | Those needing help |
| C&P exam | Still required | Required |
| Can convert to standard | Yes, if needed | N/A |

## What If I Can't Get All Evidence?

If you can't obtain certain records:

**Option 1:** File standard claim and let VA request records

**Option 2:** File FDC with available evidence plus:
- Written explanation of what's missing and why
- Documentation of your attempts to obtain records
- Request for VA to retrieve specific records

The VA may still process as FDC or convert to standard.

## FDC Timeline Example

**Day 1:** File Intent to File (protects effective date)

**Days 1-60:** Gather evidence
- Request VA records
- Request private records
- Write personal statement
- Collect buddy statements
- Obtain nexus letter if needed

**Day 61:** Submit Fully Developed Claim

**Days 62-75:** VA reviews for completeness

**Days 76-90:** C&P exam scheduled and completed

**Days 91-120:** VA rater reviews evidence and exam

**Day 121:** Decision issued

**Total:** ~4 months from claim to decision

Compare to standard claim: 6-12+ months

## Tips for FDC Success

### Be Thorough
Include everything. It's better to over-document than under-document.

### Be Organized
Clear organization helps raters find relevant evidence quickly.

### Be Complete
Don't file FDC hoping to add evidence later. That defeats the purpose.

### Be Honest
FDC certification means you have no more evidence. Don't certify if you're still gathering.

### Follow Up
Track your claim on VA.gov. Respond promptly to any VA requests.

## When FDC Converts to Standard

Your FDC may be converted to a standard claim if:
- VA determines additional evidence is needed
- Records requests are required
- Your evidence is incomplete

This isn't a failure—it just means slower processing. The claim continues; it just takes longer.

## The Bottom Line

If you have your evidence ready, file a Fully Developed Claim. It's the fastest path to a decision.

**FDC is simple:**
1. Gather all evidence
2. Organize it clearly
3. Submit with certification
4. Attend C&P exam
5. Get faster decision

Don't leave money waiting. If you're prepared, file FDC and get your benefits sooner.
