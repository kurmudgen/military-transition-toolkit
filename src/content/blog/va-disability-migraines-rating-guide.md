# VA Disability Rating for Migraines: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Migraines and chronic headaches are rated under **Diagnostic Code 8100** with ratings from **0% to 50%**. The key to getting the maximum 50% rating is documenting **prostrating attacks** (migraines severe enough to force you to stop activities) occurring **more than once per month** that are **prolonged and cause severe economic inadaptability** (significant work impairment). Most veterans with frequent, severe migraines should pursue **30% or 50%** ratings. Keep a headache diary—frequency and severity documentation wins these claims. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Are Migraines and How Does Military Service Cause Them?

Migraines are a neurological condition causing moderate to severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. They differ from tension headaches in their intensity and associated symptoms.

**Common military causes:**

- **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**: Blast exposure, concussions, head impacts
- **Neck injuries**: Cervical strain from accidents, carrying heavy loads
- **Stress**: Combat stress, operational tempo, high-pressure environments
- **Environmental exposure**: Burn pits, chemicals, fumes, solvents
- **Sleep deprivation**: Shift work, deployments, operational demands
- **Dehydration**: Field operations, hot climates, inadequate water access
- **Noise exposure**: Loud weapons fire, explosions, machinery
- **Eye strain**: Night vision devices, prolonged screen use
- **Altitude changes**: Airborne operations, high-altitude environments
- **Medication side effects**: Malaria prophylaxis, other military medications

**Why the VA recognizes migraines:**
Military service creates numerous conditions that trigger or cause chronic migraines. TBI alone significantly increases migraine risk, and many veterans have documented head trauma from their service.

## VA Rating Criteria for Migraines

Migraines are rated under **38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100**.

### Rating Table

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Less frequent attacks than for the 10% rating |
| **10%** | Characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months |
| **30%** | Characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months |
| **50%** | Very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability |

### Understanding Key Terms

**Prostrating attack:**
A headache severe enough that you must stop what you're doing and lie down or otherwise cease activity. You cannot function normally during a prostrating attack. This is not just a bad headache—it's one that incapacitates you.

**Characteristic prostrating attacks:**
Migraines with typical features such as:
- Severe pain (often one-sided)
- Nausea and/or vomiting
- Photophobia (light sensitivity)
- Phonophobia (sound sensitivity)
- Visual disturbances (aura)
- Duration of hours to days

**Severe economic inadaptability:**
Your migraines significantly impair your ability to work. This doesn't mean you must be unemployable—it means your migraines cause meaningful work impairment such as:
- Missed workdays
- Reduced productivity
- Inability to perform job functions during attacks
- Need for accommodations
- Lost job opportunities

### What the Ratings Really Mean

**10%**: You have a prostrating migraine roughly every other month (about 6 per year)

**30%**: You have prostrating migraines roughly weekly to monthly (about 12+ per year)

**50%**: You have very frequent prostrating migraines that last a long time and significantly affect your work capability

**Most veterans with chronic migraines qualify for 30% or 50%.** If you have migraines multiple times per month that force you to lie down in a dark room, you likely qualify for 50%.

## Evidence You Need to Win Your Claim

### Service Connection Evidence

**Direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing headache/migraine complaints
- Diagnosis of migraines during service
- TBI documentation (even "mild" TBI)
- Head injury or concussion records
- Sick call visits for headaches
- Profiles or duty limitations due to headaches

**Secondary service connection:**
- If claiming secondary to TBI: documented TBI during service
- If claiming secondary to cervical strain: documented neck injury
- If claiming secondary to PTSD: documented PTSD diagnosis
- If claiming secondary to tinnitus: documented service-connected tinnitus

### Current Diagnosis Evidence

1. **VA C&P exam diagnosis**
2. **Private neurologist diagnosis** with nexus statement
3. **Documented migraine characteristics:**
   - Frequency of attacks
   - Duration of attacks
   - Associated symptoms (nausea, light/sound sensitivity)
   - Prostrating nature (forced to stop activities)

### Severity Evidence

**This is critical for migraines—document severity thoroughly:**

1. **Headache diary/log:**
   - Date and time of each migraine
   - Duration (hours/days)
   - Severity (scale 1-10)
   - Symptoms (nausea, vomiting, aura, etc.)
   - What you had to do (lie down, miss work, take medication)
   - Trigger if known

2. **Medical records showing:**
   - Treatment frequency
   - Medications tried (triptans, preventives, etc.)
   - Emergency room visits for migraines
   - Specialist referrals

3. **Employment records:**
   - Missed workdays due to migraines
   - Performance issues related to migraines
   - Accommodations requested or provided

4. **Personal statement describing:**
   - Typical migraine experience
   - Impact on work and daily life
   - What happens during an attack
   - Frequency and duration patterns

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

The migraine C&P exam determines your rating. Here's what happens:

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your claims file and medical records
2. Ask about headache history and characteristics
3. Assess frequency, duration, and severity
4. Evaluate impact on work and daily activities
5. Determine if attacks are prostrating
6. Complete the Headache (including Migraine) DBQ

**Questions you'll be asked:**

**About history:**
- "When did your headaches start?"
- "What caused them or triggered them initially?"
- "Were you ever diagnosed with TBI or concussion?"

**About characteristics:**
- "Where is the pain located?"
- "What does it feel like (throbbing, pressure, stabbing)?"
- "How long do your headaches last?"
- "Do you have nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light/sound?"
- "Do you experience aura or visual changes?"

**About severity:**
- "How often do you have headaches?"
- "How many are prostrating (force you to stop activities)?"
- "What do you have to do during an attack?"
- "How long are you incapacitated?"

**About economic impact:**
- "How do your migraines affect your work?"
- "How many workdays have you missed due to migraines?"
- "Can you perform your job during a migraine?"
- "Have you lost jobs or opportunities due to migraines?"

**What to tell them (be specific):**

1. **Quantify frequency**: "I have prostrating migraines 3-4 times per month"
2. **Describe prostration**: "I have to lie in a dark room, can't function, sometimes vomit"
3. **State duration**: "Each attack lasts 6-12 hours, sometimes into the next day"
4. **Explain work impact**: "I miss 2-3 workdays per month and struggle to focus even with mild headaches"
5. **Mention all symptoms**: Don't forget nausea, light sensitivity, aura

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Not tracking migraines**: Start a diary now and bring it to the exam
- **Underreporting frequency**: Count all significant headaches, not just the worst
- **Not explaining prostration**: Clearly state you cannot function during attacks
- **Forgetting work impact**: This is essential for 50% rating
- **Minimizing symptoms**: Describe the full experience, including vomiting, inability to drive, etc.

## Secondary Conditions to Claim With Migraines

Migraines often occur with or cause other conditions:

1. **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)** - Diagnostic Code 8045
   - If you have TBI, migraines may be rated as residual
   - Claim both if not already
   - TBI rated separately: 0-100%

2. **PTSD/Depression/Anxiety** - DC 9411, 9434, 9400
   - Chronic pain causes mental health issues
   - Migraines associated with PTSD
   - Rated 0-100%

3. **Neck Strain (Cervical)** - DC 5237
   - Neck problems and migraines often connected
   - Tension headaches from cervical strain
   - Rated 0-100%

4. **Tinnitus** - DC 6260
   - Same TBI/noise exposure that causes migraines
   - Rated 10%

5. **Light Sensitivity (Photophobia)**
   - May support higher migraine rating
   - Consider vision examination

6. **Sleep Disorders** - DC 6847, 8108
   - Migraines disrupt sleep; poor sleep triggers migraines
   - Sleep apnea, insomnia

7. **Nausea/GERD** - DC 7346
   - Frequent vomiting from migraines
   - Can be secondary

8. **Vertigo** - DC 6204
   - Vestibular migraines cause vertigo
   - Rated 10-100%

## Common Reasons Claims Get Denied (And How to Avoid Them)

### 1. "Headaches not prostrating"
**Why it happens:** Examiner doesn't find attacks severe enough
**How to avoid:**
- Clearly describe being forced to stop activities
- Use the term "prostrating" in your statements
- Explain you cannot function during attacks

### 2. "Insufficient frequency for higher rating"
**Why it happens:** Not enough documented attacks
**How to avoid:**
- Keep detailed headache diary for months before exam
- Track every significant headache, not just the worst
- Bring documentation to C&P exam

### 3. "No nexus to service"
**Why it happens:** No in-service documentation or connection
**How to avoid:**
- Document any head injury, even minor
- Establish TBI connection if applicable
- Get buddy statements about in-service headaches

### 4. "No economic inadaptability" (for 50%)
**Why it happens:** Work impact not documented
**How to avoid:**
- Track missed workdays
- Document productivity issues
- Get statement from employer if possible
- Explain job limitations clearly

### 5. "Just tension headaches, not migraines"
**Why it happens:** Symptoms don't meet migraine criteria
**How to avoid:**
- Document migraine-specific symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia)
- Get neurologist diagnosis
- Describe typical migraine features

## Buddy Statement Tips for Migraines

**For family members/spouse:**
- Describe migraine episodes you've witnessed
- How the veteran behaves during attacks (lying in dark room, vomiting)
- How often migraines occur
- Impact on family life and activities

**For coworkers/supervisors:**
- Missed workdays due to headaches
- Observable behavior during headache episodes
- Impact on work performance

**Example:**
"I am the spouse of [Veteran's Name]. I witness their migraine attacks approximately [frequency]. During these attacks, they must lie in a dark, quiet room for hours, often vomiting and unable to care for themselves. They cannot tolerate light or sound. These attacks last [duration] and completely prevent them from working, driving, or participating in family activities. I have seen this pattern since [timeframe]. Their migraines have caused them to miss [events, work, activities] and significantly impact our family life."

## Appeal Strategies If Denied

### Higher-Level Review (HLR)
**Best for:** If examiner didn't properly consider prostrating nature or frequency
**When to use:** Evidence was present but misinterpreted

### Supplemental Claim
**Best for:** Adding new evidence
**What to submit:**
- Detailed headache diary (months of data)
- Private neurologist evaluation
- Independent Medical Opinion
- Employment records showing missed days
- ER visit records for severe migraines

### Board of Veterans Appeals
**Best for:** Complex cases, especially for 50% rating appeals
**When to use:** If HLR unsuccessful and you have strong evidence of economic inadaptability

**Migraine-specific appeal tips:**
- A detailed headache diary is powerful evidence
- Private neurology opinion can address prostrating nature
- Document work impact meticulously for 50% rating
- Challenge if examiner didn't ask about work impact
- Consider TDIU if migraines prevent employment

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between 30% and 50%?
Both require prostrating attacks. The 50% rating requires "very frequent" attacks that are "prolonged" and cause "severe economic inadaptability." If your migraines significantly impair your work capability (not just cause inconvenience), you should pursue 50%.

### Can I claim migraines secondary to TBI?
Yes. TBI is strongly associated with chronic migraines. If you have service-connected TBI, migraines can be claimed as secondary. Even if your TBI was rated 0%, migraines can be claimed separately.

### What if I didn't complain about headaches during service?
You can still win your claim by establishing that your current migraines began during service or are secondary to a service-connected condition. Buddy statements about in-service headaches help.

### How do I prove my attacks are "prostrating"?
Describe in detail that you must stop activities, lie down, cannot function normally, and are essentially incapacitated during attacks. Use the word "prostrating" in your statements. Track attacks in a diary with notes about what you couldn't do.

### Should I keep taking medication before the C&P exam?
Yes, continue your normal medication routine. Tell the examiner what medications you take and that your current frequency is WITH medication. Your migraine frequency while medicated is what counts.

### Can I get both a TBI rating and a separate migraine rating?
Yes, but it's complex. If your migraines are considered a residual of TBI, they may be rated as part of TBI or separately. Consult with a claims agent to maximize your ratings.

### What if my migraines have gotten worse?
File a claim for increased rating. Bring an updated headache diary showing increased frequency and severity.
