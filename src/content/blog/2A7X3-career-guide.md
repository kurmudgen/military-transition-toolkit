## Salary

| Experience | Aviation | Industrial | With Certs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entry | $40K-$55K | $35K-$50K | $45K-$60K |
| Mid | $55K-$75K | $50K-$70K | $65K-$85K |
| Senior | $70K-$95K | $60K-$80K | $80K-$105K |
| Management | $85K-$125K | $75K-$110K | $95K-$140K |

**Certification Premium:** AWS welding +$10K-$20K, A&P +$15K-$25K, NDT +$8K-$15K

## Action Plan

**Month 1:** Decide aviation vs industrial path. Get welding certs or A&P.
**Month 2:** Apply to fabrication shops, welding companies, or aviation structural roles.
**Month 3:** Start position or certification program.

## Common Mistakes

Not getting welding certifications (AWS certs essential for good welding jobs), undervaluing composite skills (growing field), not considering industrial welding (often pays equal or better), ignoring entrepreneurial opportunities (experienced fabricators can start own shops).
