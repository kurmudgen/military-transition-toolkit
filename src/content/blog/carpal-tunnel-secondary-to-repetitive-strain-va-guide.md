# Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Secondary to Repetitive Strain: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - Strong secondary claim with proper documentation
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 10-30% per wrist (higher for dominant hand)
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected condition requiring compensatory hand use, CTS diagnosis, EMG, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** High (65-80%) with documented CTS and clear connection

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can develop secondary to conditions that cause increased hand/wrist use or altered mechanics. If you have a service-connected condition that has led to CTS, this guide explains how to claim it.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability.

For CTS secondary to other conditions:
- Your primary condition must be service-connected
- CTS must be diagnosed
- The service-connected condition must have caused or worsened CTS

## How Other Conditions Cause Carpal Tunnel

### Compensatory Use

**Common Pathways:**

**Lower Extremity Conditions → CTS:**
- Wheelchair use from leg/back injuries
- Crutch/cane use from knee/ankle problems
- Walker use for mobility
- Increased hand strain for transfers

**Upper Extremity Conditions → CTS:**
- Shoulder injury → Compensatory wrist use
- Elbow condition → Altered mechanics
- One-arm overuse due to contralateral injury

### Metabolic/Systemic Conditions

**Diabetes → CTS:**
- Diabetic neuropathy affects median nerve
- Increased soft tissue swelling
- Metabolic changes in nerve tissue

**Obesity → CTS:**
- Weight gain from service-connected conditions
- Increased tissue pressure in carpal tunnel

**Thyroid Disorders → CTS:**
- Hypothyroidism causes CTS
- If thyroid condition is service-connected

### Direct Mechanisms

**Wrist/Hand Injuries:**
- Prior fractures narrowing carpal tunnel
- Arthritis in wrist affecting tunnel space
- Scarring from injuries

## What Is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?

### Anatomy

The carpal tunnel is a narrow passage in the wrist:
- Bounded by carpal bones and transverse carpal ligament
- Contains median nerve and flexor tendons
- Compression of median nerve causes CTS

### Symptoms

**Classic Presentation:**
- Numbness/tingling in thumb, index, middle fingers
- Pain in wrist radiating to hand
- Weakness in grip
- Worse at night
- Dropping objects
- Difficulty with fine motor tasks

### Diagnosis

**Clinical Tests:**
- Tinel's sign (tapping wrist)
- Phalen's test (wrist flexion)
- Durkan's test (compression)
- Thenar atrophy (advanced cases)

**Electrodiagnostic Testing:**
- Nerve conduction studies (NCS)
- EMG
- Confirms median nerve compression
- Indicates severity

## VA Rating Criteria for CTS

CTS is rated under median nerve paralysis, DC 8515:

### Major (Dominant) Hand

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 30% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 50% | Severe incomplete paralysis |
| 70% | Complete paralysis |

### Minor (Non-Dominant) Hand

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 10% | Mild incomplete paralysis |
| 20% | Moderate incomplete paralysis |
| 40% | Severe incomplete paralysis |
| 60% | Complete paralysis |

### What Constitutes Each Level?

**Mild:**
- Subjective symptoms (numbness, tingling)
- Minimal objective findings
- No significant weakness
- Normal EMG or minor slowing

**Moderate:**
- Clear sensory changes
- Mild weakness
- Abnormal EMG
- Some thenar weakness

**Severe:**
- Significant sensory loss
- Marked weakness
- Thenar atrophy
- Significantly abnormal EMG
- Functional limitations

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Primary Condition:**
- Service connection documentation
- Treatment records showing hand/wrist use
- Documentation of mobility device use
- Metabolic condition records (if applicable)

**For CTS:**
- Formal CTS diagnosis
- EMG/nerve conduction study
- Treatment records
- Surgical records (if applicable)

### The EMG/Nerve Conduction Study

**Critical Evidence:**
- Confirms median nerve compression
- Shows severity
- Distinguishes from other conditions
- Provides objective data

**Results Indicate:**
- Conduction velocity slowing
- Latency prolongation
- Severity grading

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Neurologist, orthopedist, or hand specialist
2. **Record review statement**
3. **CTS diagnosis with objective findings**
4. **Connection to service-connected condition**
5. **Medical rationale**

**Example Nexus Language (Wheelchair Use):**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records. [Veteran] is service-connected for paraplegia due to spinal cord injury at 100%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome*

*Supporting Evidence:*
*- EMG: Moderate bilateral median neuropathy at wrist*
*- Clinical: Positive Tinel's and Phalen's bilaterally*
*- Symptoms: Bilateral hand numbness, weakness, night symptoms*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected spinal cord injury.*

*Medical Rationale: [Veteran's] paraplegia requires full-time manual wheelchair use for mobility. The repetitive propulsion movements, transfers, and pressure relief maneuvers required for wheelchair use are well-documented causes of carpal tunnel syndrome in manual wheelchair users. Studies show CTS prevalence of 49-73% in wheelchair users versus 3-5% in the general population (Gellman et al., 1988)."*

**Example Nexus Language (Diabetes):**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for diabetes mellitus type 2 at [X]%.*

*Current Diagnosis: Right carpal tunnel syndrome*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] carpal tunnel syndrome is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected diabetes mellitus.*

*Medical Rationale: Diabetes is a well-recognized risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome. Diabetic patients have 2-3 times higher CTS prevalence than non-diabetics. The mechanisms include: (1) diabetic polyneuropathy making the median nerve more susceptible to compression, (2) glycosylation of collagen in the transverse carpal ligament, and (3) diabetic cheiroarthropathy affecting wrist structures."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Connection

Determine how your service-connected condition caused CTS:
- Wheelchair/mobility device use?
- Compensatory hand use?
- Metabolic condition?
- Direct wrist injury?

### Step 2: Get CTS Diagnosed

See appropriate specialist:
- Hand surgeon
- Neurologist
- Orthopedist

### Step 3: Get EMG/Nerve Conduction Study

Request this test:
- Confirms diagnosis
- Shows severity
- Strongest objective evidence

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get specialist opinion:
- Must explain mechanism
- Must cite specific connection
- Cost: $500-$1,000

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Specify which wrist(s)
- Link to service-connected condition
- Upload evidence

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Hand/wrist examination expected
- Neurological testing
- Be honest about symptoms
- Describe functional limitations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not getting EMG** - Objective confirmation essential

2. **Forgetting both wrists** - If bilateral, claim both

3. **Weak connection explanation** - Must explain HOW primary caused CTS

4. **Missing diabetes connection** - Common but overlooked pathway

5. **Not documenting wheelchair use** - Keep mobility device records

6. **Waiting until severe** - Claim when diagnosed, not just when severe

7. **Not specifying dominant hand** - Higher rating for major hand

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Wheelchair User

**Background:** 45-year-old veteran, 100% SCI paraplegia
- Manual wheelchair since 2010
- Bilateral hand numbness developing
- EMG confirms bilateral CTS

**Evidence:**
- Wheelchair use documentation
- EMG showing moderate bilateral CTS
- Hand surgeon nexus citing wheelchair mechanism

**Outcome:**
- Right (dominant): 30% moderate
- Left: 20% moderate
**Added Rating:** 44% from CTS alone

### Case Study 2: Crutch User

**Background:** 52-year-old veteran, 30% left leg amputation
- Uses forearm crutches
- Right wrist CTS developed
- EMG confirms right CTS

**Evidence:**
- Crutch use documentation
- EMG showing right median neuropathy
- Nexus explaining repetitive strain from crutch use

**Outcome:** 30% for right (dominant) hand CTS
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 51% (rounds to 50%)

### Case Study 3: Diabetes Secondary

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, diabetes service-connected
- Bilateral hand numbness
- EMG confirms CTS
- No obvious trauma history

**Evidence:**
- Diabetes at 20%
- Bilateral CTS on EMG
- Endocrinologist nexus

**Outcome:**
- Right: 20%
- Left: 10%
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 44% (rounds to 40%)

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Single Hand 20%:**
- Before: 40% = $524.31
- Add 20% CTS = 52% → rounds to 50%
- After: $1,041.82
- Increase: $517.51/month

**Bilateral (30% dominant + 20% other):**
- Before: 50%
- Add 30% + 20% = 44% combined for CTS
- Plus bilateral factor
- Significant increase

## Bilateral Considerations

### Can You Claim Both Wrists?

**Yes.** Each wrist is rated separately.

### Major vs. Minor

Specify which is your dominant hand:
- Major (dominant) gets higher rating
- Minor (non-dominant) gets lower rating
- Same symptoms, different percentages

### Bilateral Factor

If both hands affected:
- Combine ratings first
- Add 10% of combined value
- Then add to other ratings

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No confirmed CTS"** - Need EMG
2. **"Not related to service-connected condition"** - Need clearer nexus
3. **"Idiopathic CTS"** - Must overcome general population argument

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add EMG if not done
- Stronger nexus explaining mechanism
- Medical literature supporting connection
- Detailed documentation of causative activities

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need an EMG to claim CTS?**
A: Not absolutely required, but it's the strongest evidence and makes approval much more likely.

**Q: Can wheelchair use really cause CTS?**
A: Absolutely. Studies show 49-73% of manual wheelchair users develop CTS.

**Q: What if my CTS existed before my primary condition?**
A: If your primary condition worsened existing CTS, claim aggravation.

**Q: Does surgery affect my rating?**
A: Post-surgical residuals are rated based on remaining symptoms.

**Q: Can both hands get the same rating?**
A: No. The dominant hand gets a higher rating percentage.

**Q: What if I use a power wheelchair now?**
A: CTS from prior manual use can still be claimed.

**Q: Is CTS from typing in service the same claim?**
A: That would be direct service connection, not secondary.
