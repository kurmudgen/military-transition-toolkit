# VA Rating for Plantar Fasciitis and Foot Pain: Complete Disability Guide

Plantar fasciitis and other foot conditions are among the most common service-connected disabilities, affecting thousands of veterans. Military service creates significant foot stress through extended marching with heavy equipment, parachute operations, running on hard surfaces, and desert or mountain terrain traversal. Many veterans don't realize chronic foot pain qualifies for VA disability compensation. Understanding rating criteria and evidence requirements is crucial for claiming these benefits.

## Understanding Plantar Fasciitis and Military Causation

Plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the plantar fascia—a thick band of tissue running across the bottom of the foot connecting the heel to the toes. It causes sharp heel pain, especially upon waking or after extended standing.

Military service creates foot injuries through:

**Extended Marching**: Heavy load carrying during ruck marches, combat patrols, and field operations

**Parachute Operations**: High-impact landing in airborne operations straining foot tissues

**Running**: Physical training on hard surfaces creating repetitive stress

**Terrain**: Desert, rocky, or uneven terrain during deployments straining foot structures

**Equipment Weight**: Combat equipment and protective gear adding 75+ pounds during operations

**Hard Surfaces**: Concrete barracks floors and military bases creating chronic stress

**Training Accidents**: Ankle twists, falls, or direct trauma during operations

Other foot conditions service-connected include:
- Foot arthritis from repetitive stress
- Heel spurs
- Morton's neuromas
- Flat feet (fallen arches)
- Metatarsalgia (ball of foot pain)
- Stress fractures

## VA Rating System for Foot Conditions

The VA rates foot conditions using multiple diagnostic codes:
- **DC 5020**: Foot, limitation of motion of
- **DC 5023**: Foot, major abnormality of
- **DC 5024**: Foot, minor abnormality of
- **DC 5046**: Flatfoot (pes planus)
- **DC 5099**: Foot, other conditions

Rating is based on functional limitation and structural findings rather than pain complaints alone.

### Rating Percentages and Criteria

**0% (Not Rated)** - No functional limitation despite possible foot condition

**10% Rating** - Minimal functional limitation:
- Occasional pain with extended activity
- Full or near-full foot function
- Can walk unlimited distances
- Minimal work restrictions
- Normal shoe wear tolerated

**20% Rating** - Mild functional limitation:
- Pain with prolonged standing/walking
- Slight functional limitation with activities
- Some shoe modification helpful
- Minimal occupational impact
- Extended activity somewhat limited

**30% Rating** - Moderate functional limitation:
- Pain with standing and walking (limited to 2-3 hours)
- Notable functional limitation
- Shoe modification necessary
- Some occupational restrictions
- Extended activity significantly limited

**40% Rating** - Moderately severe functional limitation:
- Pain with limited standing/walking (under 2 hours)
- Significant functional limitation
- Special shoes or orthotics required
- Substantial occupational impact
- Work restrictions on standing/walking jobs

**50%-100% Rating** - Severe to total disability:
- Severe functional impairment
- Inability to walk or stand without significant pain
- May require assistive devices
- Often combined with other conditions
- 100% typically TDIU

## Monthly Compensation for Foot Conditions

Monthly compensation varies by rating percentage. As of 2025:

**10% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $175-$185/month

**20% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $253-$270/month

**30% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $330-$350/month

**40% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $470-$490/month

**50% Rating:**
- Veteran alone: $605-$625/month

These amounts increase annually with COLA. Combined ratings with other disabilities increase total compensation.

## Evidence Requirements for Foot Claims

## Nexus Letter for Foot Claims

A nexus letter from a podiatrist, orthopedist, or primary care physician establishes service connection for foot conditions.

### Essential Components

**Medical Opinion**
Statement that foot condition is "at least as likely as not" caused by military service.

**Service-Related Cause**
Specific explanation of how service caused condition:
- Repetitive marching with heavy equipment
- Impact from parachute landing
- Running on hard surfaces during training
- Terrain demands during deployments
- Specific injury incident

**Medical Evidence Review**
Reference diagnostic findings, imaging results, and treatment history.

**Functional Impact Assessment**
Description of resulting standing/walking limitations.

### Quality Nexus Providers

- **VA Podiatrists**: Free through VA podiatry services
- **Private Podiatrists**: Board-certified specialists ($300-$600)
- **Orthopedic Surgeons**: For complex foot injuries
- **Sports Medicine Physicians**: Familiar with overuse injuries
- **VSO-Affiliated Providers**: Approved providers for veteran claims

## C&P Exam Preparation

The VA frequently schedules C&P exams for foot disability claims. These are typically conducted by podiatrists or general practitioners.

### Exam Components

**Medical History**:
- Foot injury onset and circumstances
- Pain character and severity
- Standing and walking tolerance
- Treatment history
- Current symptoms
- Occupational impact

**Physical Examination**:
- Visual inspection for swelling, deformity
- Palpation for tenderness and pain triggers
- Range of motion testing (ankle, foot, toes)
- Strength testing
- Gait assessment
- Orthotic or special shoe evaluation

**Functional Assessment**:
- Standing tolerance (how long before pain?)
- Walking tolerance (how far before pain?)
- Occupational demands
- Daily activity impact

### Preparation Tips

- **Specific Pain Description**: "Sharp pain in heel first thing in morning," "Pain in ball of foot after walking more than 15 minutes"
- **Document Standing/Walking Tolerance**: "I can stand 30 minutes before severe pain," "I can't walk more than a quarter mile"
- **Bring Footwear**: Show orthotics, special shoes, or supportive footwear used
- **Describe Occupational Impact**: "I can't perform foot patrol duties," "I had to change jobs due to standing requirements"
- **Medication List**: Include all pain medications and treatments tried
- **Imaging Records**: Provide all X-ray, ultrasound, or MRI reports
- **Be Honest About Function**: Don't minimize or exaggerate pain; accurate description leads to appropriate rating
- **Daily Impact**: Describe impact on household chores, recreation, relationship with family

The examiner assesses both objective findings (imaging, exam results) and your functional limitation description.

## Real Claim Examples

- Multiple treatment attempts documented

**Outcome**: 40% foot rating. Combined with other conditions: 60% overall. Monthly compensation: $490.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Pain-Only Complaints Without Functional Documentation
Simply saying "my feet hurt" doesn't justify higher ratings.

**Solution**: Specify functional limitations: "I can't walk more than one mile," "I can't stand more than two hours."

### Mistake 2: No Imaging Evidence
Filing without X-rays or other imaging weakens claims.

**Solution**: Obtain foot imaging from VA or civilian provider before filing.

### Mistake 3: Missing Specialist Evaluation
Filing without podiatrist or orthopedic assessment for higher-percentage claims.

**Solution**: See VA or civilian foot specialist before filing for 30%+ ratings.

### Mistake 4: Weak Nexus Letter
Lack of professional medical nexus reduces approval likelihood.

**Solution**: Obtain nexus letter from podiatrist or physician familiar with military occupational demands.

### Mistake 5: No Treatment Documentation
Lack of treatment suggests minor condition.

**Solution**: Seek physical therapy, obtain orthotics, or pursue other treatments documenting condition severity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get disability for plantar fasciitis if I'm using orthotics successfully?**
A: Yes. Rating is based on the condition itself and functional limitation, not orthotics effectiveness.

**Q: What standing tolerance limits justify 40% rating?**
A: Generally inability to stand more than 2 hours continuously with significant pain.

**Q: Should I file if I'm waiting for foot surgery?**
A: Yes. File with current status; supplement after surgery if condition worsens.

**Q: Can I file for both feet with different conditions?**
A: Yes, if both service-connected. Rating is bilateral consideration.

**Q: Is flat feet alone enough for service connection?**
A: Flat feet requiring treatment or causing significant functional limitation qualify. Simple flat feet without symptoms may not.

## Conclusion

Foot disability claims are highly approvable with proper imaging, specialist evaluation, and documentation of standing and walking limitations. Functional impairment is the key—the VA focuses on how the condition limits your ability to stand, walk, and perform occupational duties.

Start your claim through VA.gov, your VA Regional Office, or with VSO assistance. Proper documentation combining imaging evidence, specialist evaluation, and clear functional limitation description, supported by a strong nexus letter, leads to successful approvals.

With persistence and comprehensive evidence, most veterans successfully secure meaningful foot disability ratings and monthly compensation for service-connected plantar fasciitis and other foot conditions.
