## PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS (Q101-Q120)

### Q101: How much can I save on property taxes in Florida as a 100% disabled veteran? {#q101}

**A:** Florida offers a complete property tax exemption for 100% permanently and totally (P&T) disabled veterans, typically saving $2,000-$8,000 per year depending on your home's value and county.

Florida provides one of the most generous property tax benefits in the country for disabled veterans. If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, you pay zero property taxes on your primary residence.

**Savings breakdown by home value:**

*Based on typical Florida millage rates (varies by county):*
- $200,000 home: ~$2,400/year savings
- $300,000 home: ~$3,600/year savings
- $400,000 home: ~$4,800/year savings
- $500,000 home: ~$6,000/year savings
- $750,000 home: ~$9,000/year savings

Exact savings depend on your county's millage rate (property tax rate), which varies. Some counties have higher rates (Duval, Orange) while others are lower (Collier, Lee).

**Eligibility requirements:**

1. **100% Permanent and Total (P&T) VA disability rating**
   - Must be permanent (not temporary TDIU)
   - Rating letter must show "permanent and total"
   - Service-connected disabilities total 100%

2. **Florida must be your permanent residence**
   - You must be a Florida resident
   - Home must be your primary residence (not vacation/investment property)
   - Can only claim on one property

3. **You must apply through your county**
   - Contact county property appraiser's office
   - Provide VA rating letter showing 100% P&T
   - Usually requires annual application initially, then automatic renewal

**Application process:**

1. **Obtain your 100% P&T rating letter from VA**
   - Download from VA.gov or eBenefits
   - Must clearly state "permanent and total"
   - Some counties accept VA summary letter

2. **Contact your county property appraiser**
   - Find office: [County name] property appraiser
   - Call or visit in person
   - Ask for "disabled veteran property tax exemption application"

3. **Submit required documents:**
   - VA rating letter (100% P&T)
   - Florida driver's license or ID (proves residency)
   - DD-214 (proof of military service)
   - Property deed (proves ownership)
   - Sometimes requires completed application form

4. **Processing:**
   - Most counties process within 30-60 days
   - Exemption typically takes effect the following tax year
   - Some counties can apply exemption retroactively if you were eligible in prior years

**Additional exemptions you may qualify for:**

Florida allows stacking of multiple exemptions:

**Homestead exemption:** First $50,000 of assessed value exempt (available to all Florida homeowners)
**Disabled veteran exemption:** 100% property tax exemption if 100% P&T
**Combined benefit:** Both can apply, though 100% exemption covers everything

Some counties also offer:
- Additional exemptions for wheelchair-bound veterans
- Vehicle property tax exemptions
- License plate fee waivers

**Important notes:**

**Must be "permanent and total":**
- TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) at 100% may NOT qualify unless state law specifically includes it
- Florida requires **schedulerific 100% P&T rating**
- If your rating is temporary or under review, you may not qualify until permanent

**Exceptions by county:**
Some counties have slightly different requirements or processes. Always check with your specific county property appraiser.

**Property value cap:**
Unlike some states, Florida has NO property value cap for this exemption. Even if your home is worth $2 million, you pay $0 in property taxes if 100% P&T.

**Other family members:**

- **Surviving spouse:** If the veteran dies, surviving spouse may continue to receive the exemption if they don't remarry and continue to occupy the property
- **Children:** Does not transfer to children

**What if I'm below 100%?**

Florida also offers partial exemptions for veterans rated below 100%:

- **10-29% rating:** $5,000 assessed value exemption
- **30-49% rating:** $7,500 assessed value exemption
- **50-69% rating:** $10,000 assessed value exemption
- **70-99% rating:** $12,000 assessed value exemption

These are smaller exemptions but still provide savings.

**How much is $12,000 exemption worth?**
- Reduces assessed value by $12,000
- Saves approximately $240-$360/year depending on millage rate
- Less impactful than the full 100% exemption, but still valuable

**Comparing Florida to other states:**

Florida is one of **20 states offering full property tax exemptions** for 100% disabled veterans:
- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia

This makes Florida highly attractive for disabled veterans considering relocation.

**Tax impact calculator:**

**Example scenario:**
- Home value: $400,000
- County: Hillsborough
- Millage rate: ~12 mills (varies annually)
- **Without exemption:** $4,800/year property tax
- **With 100% exemption:** $0/year property tax
- **Annual savings:** $4,800
- **10-year savings:** $48,000
- **20-year savings:** $96,000

For a veteran living in Florida for 20 years, this exemption can save nearly $100,000.

**Common questions:**

**Q: Do I need to reapply every year?**
A: Initially you may need to reapply, but most counties grant automatic renewal once approved.

**Q: What if I move to a different Florida county?**
A: You must reapply with the new county property appraiser.

**Q: Can I claim this on a second home or rental property?**
A: No, only your primary residence qualifies.

**Q: What if my rating drops below 100%?**
A: You'll lose the full exemption but may qualify for a partial exemption based on your new rating.

**Trend:** States are moving TOWARD exempting military retirement to attract veterans.

**What counts as "military retirement pay":**

**Typically exempt:**
- Regular military retirement (20+ years)
- Medical retirement
- Disability retirement
- Reserve retirement
- Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments

**May be treated differently:**
- VA disability compensation (federally tax-free in all states)
- Military pension while working civilian job (still exempt in most states)

**VA disability vs. military retirement:**

Important distinction:
- **VA disability compensation:** Tax-free everywhere (federal law)
- **Military retirement pay:** Subject to state tax unless state provides exemption

Even in states that tax military retirement, VA disability remains untaxed.

**Examples of tax savings:**

**Scenario 1: Retired E-8 with $3,000/month pension**
- Annual retirement: $36,000
- **California** (fully taxed at ~6-8%): Pay ~$2,160-$2,880/year state tax
- **Florida** (no tax): Pay $0/year
- **Annual savings by moving to Florida:** $2,160-$2,880
- **30-year savings:** $64,800-$86,400

**Scenario 2: Retired O-5 with $5,500/month pension**
- Annual retirement: $66,000
- **California** (fully taxed at ~8-9%): Pay ~$5,280-$5,940/year state tax
- **Texas** (no tax): Pay $0/year
- **Annual savings:** $5,280-$5,940
- **30-year savings:** $158,400-$178,200

**Strategic considerations when choosing where to retire:**

**Tax-friendly states for veterans (best overall):**
1. **Florida:** No income tax + full property tax exemption for 100% disabled
2. **Texas:** No income tax + full property tax exemption for 100% disabled
3. **South Carolina:** No income tax on military retirement + generous property tax exemptions
4. **Tennessee:** No income tax + low cost of living
5. **Virginia:** Increasing exemptions + strong veteran services

**States to avoid for taxability:**
1. **California:** Full taxation, high rates, expensive
2. **D.C.:** Full taxation, high cost of living
3. **Oregon:** Taxes retirement, high rates

**However, consider total picture:**
- State income tax is just one factor
- Property taxes matter too (Texas has high property taxes despite no income tax)
- Cost of living varies dramatically
- Quality of life, healthcare access, veteran services also important

**How to verify your state's treatment:**

1. **Check state department of revenue website**
   - Search "[state name] military retirement tax"
   - Official guidance from state tax authority

2. **Contact state veterans affairs office**
   - Can clarify exemptions and how to claim

3. **Consult a tax professional**
   - Especially if moving between states mid-year

**How to claim exemption (for states with partial exemptions):**

**On your state tax return:**
- Complete the state-specific form for military retirement exemption
- Report total military retirement income
- Subtract the exempt amount
- Pay tax only on remaining (if any)

**Example: Virginia 2024**
- Military retirement: $50,000
- Exemption: $20,000
- Taxable: $30,000
- Tax on $30,000 at Virginia rates (~5.75%): ~$1,725

**What if you move mid-year?**

**You may owe tax to both states:**
- State 1 (where you lived Jan-June): Tax on half your annual retirement
- State 2 (where you lived July-Dec): Tax on half your annual retirement

**Pro tip:** Move early in the year to minimize taxes in the high-tax state.

**Dual residency issues:**

Some states are aggressive about claiming you're still a resident:
- **California:** Especially aggressive, may claim you're still resident even after moving
- **New York:** Also pursues former residents

**Establish clear residency in your new state:**
- Get new driver's license immediately
- Register to vote
- Register vehicles
- Change mailing address with DFAS
- File Declaration of Domicile if state requires
- Cut ties with old state (close bank accounts, sell property, etc.)

**Bottom line:**

37 states don't tax military retirement at all, making them attractive for retired service members. When planning retirement, factor in state income tax treatment of military retirement alongside property taxes, cost of living, and quality of life. Moving from a high-tax state like California to a no-tax state like Florida can save tens of thousands of dollars over retirement.
