## Bottom Line Up Front

**Burn pit exposure during military service creates VA presumptive conditions requiring no nexus letter.** The PACT Act (Preventing All Cigarette Trafficking Act, extended to burn pits) established presumptive conditions for veterans exposed to burn pits in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations. Qualifying conditions include respiratory disease, asthma, COPD, and lung cancer. Veterans need only prove military service in a burn pit location and presence of presumptive condition; VA assumes causation. Processing time 90-120 days; approval rates 85%+ for properly documented claims. Simple filing process: much easier than proving nexus for other conditions.

## What Are Burn Pits and Burn Pit Exposure?

### Background
- **Military waste disposal**: Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) used large open pits to burn garbage, munitions, hazardous waste
- **Chronic exposure**: Veterans stationed at bases with burn pits exposed continuously
- **Smoke inhalation**: Daily smoke inhalation containing unknown chemical compounds
- **Respiratory effects**: Chronic exposure causes respiratory disease years after service
- **Major burn pit locations**: Camp Lejeune, Kandahar, Balad Air Base, Al Asad Air Base, and numerous other locations

### Health Effects
- Respiratory disease onset typically 5-15 years post-exposure
- Conditions include: asthma, COPD, bronchitis, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis
- Cumulative exposure causes progressive lung disease
- Many veterans unaware burn pit exposure caused symptoms

### Presumptive Condition Requirement

**Medical Diagnosis of Presumptive Condition:**
- Diagnosed by medical provider (VA or private)
- Documented in medical records
- Meets diagnostic criteria for condition (e.g., asthma diagnosis requires specific testing/criteria)
- Diagnosis can be at any time post-exposure (even decades later)

---

## Evidence Requirements and Eligibility Documentation

### Proof of Service at Burn Pit Location

**Military Service Records:**
- Discharge papers (DD 214)
- Military service record showing deployment dates and locations
- Official military records confirming service at exposed base
- **Most Important:** Service record listing base location during burn pit operational period

**If Records Missing:**
- Buddy statements (written by fellow service members confirming service location)
- Military unit history documentation
- Photographic evidence (if available)
- VA accepts multiple forms of evidence if official records unavailable

### Medical Evidence

**VA Medical Records:**
- Diagnosis of presumptive condition documented
- Medical provider explicitly diagnoses condition (not just "possible asthma," but "asthma diagnosis")
- Medical documentation supporting diagnosis

**Private Medical Records:**
- Pulmonologist or relevant specialist diagnosis
- Pulmonary function tests (for respiratory conditions)
- Chest X-rays or CT scans
- Medical documentation of condition

**Diagnostic Testing:**
- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): measure lung capacity, airflow
- Chest imaging: X-ray or CT showing changes consistent with diagnosis
- Lab work: as relevant to specific condition

### Supporting Documentation

**Personal Statement:**
- Timeline: when deployed to burn pit location
- Description of burn pit exposure: "Daily exposure to burn pit smoke at [base name]"
- Symptom onset: when respiratory symptoms began
- Progression: how condition has worsened over time

**Family Corroboration:**
- Family member statement describing symptom progression
- Examples of condition impact on daily life
- Timeline of symptom development

## Step-by-Step Filing Process (Simplified)

### Step 1: Confirm Service at Burn Pit Location (Week 1)

**Gather Service Records:**
- DD 214 (discharge papers)
- Military service documentation showing deployment
- Confirm service dates and base location

**Verify Exposure:**
- Check VA burn pit location list
- Confirm base where you served had burn pit
- If unsure, file anyway; VA will investigate

### Step 2: Obtain Medical Diagnosis (Weeks 1-4)

**If Already Diagnosed:**
- Gather medical records documenting presumptive condition diagnosis
- Ensure diagnosis is explicit (not just "possible" or "suspected")

**If Not Yet Diagnosed:**
- Schedule appointment with VA primary care or relevant specialist
- Request evaluation for respiratory condition
- Request diagnosis of presumptive condition (asthma, COPD, etc.)
- Pulmonologist referral may help strengthen diagnosis
- Timeline: 2-8 weeks

### Step 3: Prepare Simplified Claim (Week 5)

**Use Form 21-0960 (Standard Disability Claim):**
- Mark this as presumptive condition claim
- List presumptive condition (e.g., "Asthma presumptive to burn pit exposure")
- Service location: name base where exposed to burn pit
- Service dates at that location

**Simplified Narrative:**
"I am claiming [presumptive condition] presumptive to burn pit exposure. I served at [base name] from [dates]. This base had active burn pits during my service. I have been diagnosed with [condition], a presumptive condition for burn pit exposure. I am attaching documentation of my service and medical diagnosis of the presumptive condition."

### Step 4: Compile Documentation Package (Week 6)

**Presumptive Burn Pit Claim Package (Simplified):**
1. Form 21-0960
2. DD 214 (proof of military service)
3. Service records showing deployment to burn pit location
4. Medical diagnosis of presumptive condition
5. Diagnostic testing (if available: PFTs, chest imaging)
6. Personal statement describing exposure and symptom timeline
7. Family statement (optional but helpful)

**NO NEXUS LETTER REQUIRED** (This is key advantage of presumptive conditions)

### Step 5: File Claim (Week 7)

**Filing Options:**
- Online at VA.gov (fastest, recommended)
- Mail to VA Regional Office
- In-person at local VA Medical Center

**Key Advantage:**
- No need to prove nexus (VA assumes causation)
- Much simpler than proving causation for non-presumptive conditions
- Higher approval rates due to presumptive nature

## Timeline and Examples

### Processing Timeline: 90-120 Days

**Typical Timeline:**
- Days 1-14: Initial processing
- Days 14-45: VA verifies service location and burn pit presence
- Days 45-90: VA reviews medical evidence
- Days 90-120: Decision issued

**Advantages Over Non-Presumptive Claims:**
- No C&P exam likely (medical diagnosis sufficient)
- Faster processing (no nexus letter needed)
- Higher approval rates

### Success Example: CPL Martinez (Asthma Presumptive to Burn Pit)

**Background:** Infantry soldier, deployed to Balad Air Base 2008-2009. Developed asthma symptoms 2015.

**Claim Details:**
- Service documentation: DD 214 showing deployment to Balad Air Base 2008-2009
- Medical evidence: VA pulmonologist diagnosed asthma 2020; PFTs consistent with asthma; no prior asthma history
- VA records: Service at Balad Air Base confirmed (base had burn pits during service dates)
- Personal statement: "Deployed to Balad 2008-2009 where burn pits burned constantly. Started having breathing problems 2015, asthma diagnosis 2020"

**Outcome:**
- Asthma presumptive to burn pit exposure approved
- Rating: 20% (based on asthma severity and functional impairment)
- Processing time: 105 days
- Approval reason: "Presumptive condition. Service confirmed at burn pit exposure location. Asthma diagnosis documented."

**Success Factors:** Service confirmation at burn pit location; clear asthma diagnosis; no nexus letter needed

### Learning Example: MSgt Thompson (COPD, Initially Delayed)

**Initial Issue:**
- Filed for COPD presumptive to burn pit exposure
- Service records showed Kandahar deployment 2009-2010
- Medical records documented COPD diagnosis

**Delay:**
- VA requested clarification of burn pit exposure at Kandahar
- Initial records didn't specify burn pit documentation
- Processing delayed while VA verified burn pit presence at Kandahar

**Resolution:**
- Provided additional military records confirming Kandahar had burn pits during service
- Unit history showing burn pit operations
- Additional PFT testing strengthening COPD diagnosis

**Outcome:** COPD presumptive approved, 8-week delay

**Key Lesson:** Clearly establish burn pit presence at your service location. If records don't explicitly mention burn pit, provide additional documentation or unit history showing burn pit operations.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Unclear Service Documentation
**Mistake:** Filing without clear proof of service at burn pit location.

**Fix:** Gather DD 214 explicitly showing base location. Include additional documentation if records don't clearly show burn pit location.

### 2. Vague Medical Diagnosis
**Mistake:** Filing with "possible asthma" or "suspected COPD" instead of formal diagnosis.

**Fix:** Request formal diagnosis from VA or private provider. Diagnosis must be explicit in medical records.

### 3. Non-Presumptive Condition Confusion
**Mistake:** Filing for non-presumptive condition (not on VA list) and expecting presumptive approval.

**Fix:** Check current presumptive list on VA.gov. File for presumptive conditions only for presumptive claims. File for non-presumptive with nexus letter.

### 4. Missing Diagnostic Testing
**Mistake:** Filing without objective testing supporting diagnosis.

**Fix:** Request PFTs (pulmonary function tests) for respiratory conditions. Objective testing strengthens even presumptive claims.

### 5. No Service Documentation
**Mistake:** Assuming VA knows you served at burn pit location without providing proof.

**Fix:** Explicitly provide discharge papers and service records showing deployment. Don't assume.

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to prove burn pit caused my condition?
**A:** No. Presumptive conditions are VA's way of assuming causation. You only need to prove: (1) service at burn pit location, (2) diagnosis of presumptive condition.

### Q: What if my service records don't mention burn pit?
**A:** File anyway. If you served at base on VA's burn pit location list during burn pit operational period, you likely qualify. Provide base name and dates; VA will verify burn pit presence.

### Q: Can I file for non-presumptive condition from burn pit?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need nexus letter proving burn pit caused condition (harder to win). Focus on presumptive conditions for easier approval.

### Q: How long will approval take?
**A:** Typically 90-120 days. Much faster than non-presumptive claims (which take 120-150+ days).

### Q: What rating will I receive?
**A:** Rating depends on condition severity. Asthma might be 10-20%; COPD might be 20-40%; lung cancer might be higher. Rating determined by functional impairment.

### Q: Can I claim multiple presumptive conditions?
**A:** Yes. If exposed and diagnosed with multiple presumptive conditions, file for all. Separate ratings apply to each; combined rating calculated.
