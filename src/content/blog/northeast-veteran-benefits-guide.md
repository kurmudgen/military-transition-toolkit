# Northeast Veteran Benefits Guide: 11 States Compared

Let's address the elephant in the room: the Northeast has a reputation for being expensive, heavily taxed, and generally unfriendly to retirees. And for the most part... yeah, that's accurate.

But here's the thing—some states in this region actually try to take care of veterans. Pennsylvania stands out as a legitimate surprise. New Hampshire lives up to its "Live Free or Die" motto. And even high-tax states like Massachusetts offer world-class VA healthcare that might justify the financial pain.

We're covering 11 states here: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Some will pleasantly surprise you. Others will make you wonder why anyone retires there at all.

## #1: Pennsylvania - The Northeast's Hidden Gem

**Winner:** Military retirement fully tax-exempt, strong property tax exemptions for disabled vets, reasonable cost of living.

**Loser:** Some rural areas lack good VA access, winters are cold, infrastructure is aging.

Pennsylvania doesn't screw around when it comes to veteran benefits. It's genuinely one of the best states in the entire country for veterans—not just in the Northeast, but period.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement income:** 100% exempt from state income tax. All of it. No caps, no age restrictions.
- **Disability pay:** Also fully exempt.
- **Property taxes:** 100% disabled veterans can get significant exemptions (varies by county, but often 50-100% reduction).

### VA Healthcare

Pennsylvania has **six VA Medical Centers**:
- Philadelphia (two locations)
- Pittsburgh
- Wilkes-Barre
- Lebanon
- Erie
- Butler

Plus dozens of community-based outpatient clinics. Coverage is strong across most of the state, though rural northern PA can require longer drives.

Philadelphia and Pittsburgh VA facilities are well-regarded and have been upgraded significantly in recent years.

### Cost of Living Reality Check

Pennsylvania is **way cheaper** than most of the Northeast. You can buy a solid house in central PA, Pittsburgh suburbs, or even Philly suburbs for under $300K. Property taxes are moderate (for the Northeast), especially with veteran exemptions.

Philadelphia and Pittsburgh offer urban amenities without the insane costs of NYC or Boston. The suburbs and rural areas are affordable—sometimes surprisingly so.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want full military retirement tax exemption without leaving the Northeast
- Anyone seeking reasonable cost of living with four seasons
- Disabled veterans who want strong property tax relief
- Folks who want urban options (Philly, Pittsburgh) or rural living
- Anyone who grew up in the region and wants to stay close to family

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans who hate cold winters and snow
- Anyone seeking cutting-edge job markets (it's manufacturing-heavy, less tech)
- People who want sunshine (it's gray much of the year)

**Bottom Line:** Pennsylvania is shockingly good for veterans. It punches way above its weight in the Northeast and belongs in the national conversation.

## #2: New Hampshire - Live Free or Die (Without Income Tax)

**Winner:** No state income tax, strong property tax exemptions for disabled vets, safe communities.

**Loser:** High property tax rates (offset by exemptions), expensive housing, limited VA care.

New Hampshire lives its libertarian motto—it doesn't tax your income and generally stays out of your business.

### Tax Situation

- **No state income tax** (they tax dividends and interest, but that's being phased out).
- **No sales tax.**
- **Property taxes:** High rates (one of the highest in the nation), BUT...
- **Disabled veteran exemption:** $50,000 to $400,000 off assessed value depending on disability rating and circumstances.

### The Property Tax Math

Here's the deal: New Hampshire's property tax rates are around 2% of assessed value. That hurts. But if you're 100% disabled, you can exempt up to $400,000 of your home's value. On a $400K house, that's potentially $8,000 in annual savings.

If you're not disabled? You'll feel those property taxes hard.

### VA Healthcare

- **Manchester VA Medical Center** is the main facility.
- **White River Junction VA** (technically in Vermont) serves western NH.
- Several outpatient clinics scattered around the state.

It's adequate, but if you need specialized care, you might be heading to Boston VA (which is excellent, but it's in Massachusetts).

### Cost of Living

New Hampshire is expensive—especially near Massachusetts and coastal areas. Housing costs are high, though you get safe communities, good schools, and quality of life.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want to avoid income tax and value personal freedom
- Disabled veterans who'll benefit from massive property tax exemptions
- Anyone who loves outdoor recreation (mountains, lakes, hiking, skiing)
- Folks who want to be near Boston without living in Massachusetts

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans without disability ratings (property taxes will crush you)
- Anyone who needs frequent VA care beyond primary care
- People on tight budgets (it's expensive)

**Bottom Line:** New Hampshire is ideal if you're disabled and want no income tax, but it's pricey for everyone else.

## #3: Delaware - Small State, Moderate Benefits

**Winner:** No sales tax, partially exempt military retirement, decent cost of living (for the region).

**Loser:** Property tax exemptions are limited, small state with limited variety, VA care is limited.

Delaware flies under the radar—it's tiny, but it offers some advantages for veterans who want to stay on the East Coast without the extremes.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $12,500 annually.
- **No sales tax** (helps with daily purchases).
- **Property taxes:** Lower than many Northeast states, but veteran-specific exemptions are modest.

### VA Healthcare

- **Wilmington VA Medical Center** is the main facility.
- It's a small VA system, but Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore VA facilities are within reasonable driving distance.

### Cost of Living

Delaware is cheaper than New Jersey, Maryland, or Pennsylvania suburbs near Philly—but it's not cheap by national standards. Beach towns (Rehoboth, Bethany) are expensive. Inland areas are more reasonable.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want beach access without Florida prices
- Anyone who wants to avoid sales tax (it adds up)
- Folks who want a small-town feel with access to major cities
- People who work in Philly or Baltimore and want lower costs

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans who need robust VA care
- Anyone seeking major tax exemptions (the $12,500 cap is weak)
- People who want variety and space (it's a tiny state)

**Bottom Line:** Delaware is fine—not great, not terrible. It's a reasonable compromise if you want to stay in the region.

## #4: Maryland - Excellent VA, Lousy Taxes

**Winner:** Outstanding VA healthcare (especially near DC/Baltimore), strong job market (defense contractors).

**Loser:** High taxes, modest exemptions, expensive cost of living.

Maryland has world-class VA facilities and tons of job opportunities—but you'll pay for the privilege.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Only the first $5,000 is exempt (pathetically low).
- **Property taxes:** Vary by county; some offer disabled veteran exemptions, but they're modest.
- **State income tax:** Progressive rates up to 5.75% (plus local taxes).

### VA Healthcare

- **Baltimore VA Medical Center** is excellent.
- **Perry Point VA** (northeast MD) is solid.
- **Fort Belvoir** (just across the line in Virginia) serves many Maryland veterans.
- Access to Walter Reed and other military hospitals if you have TRICARE.

Maryland's VA system is genuinely top-tier. If healthcare is your priority, this matters.

### Job Market

Maryland is thick with defense contractors, federal agencies, and cybersecurity firms. If you're transitioning and have a clearance, you can land a six-figure job relatively easily.

Fort Meade (NSA, U.S. Cyber Command) and Aberdeen Proving Ground drive massive defense industry presence.

### Cost of Living

Montgomery County (DC suburbs) and Anne Arundel County (Annapolis area) are crazy expensive. Baltimore is cheaper but has crime issues in certain areas. Eastern Shore is more affordable.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans transitioning into defense contracting or federal work
- Anyone who prioritizes top-tier VA healthcare
- Folks with security clearances seeking high-paying jobs
- Service members stationed at Meade or Aberdeen who want to stay

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (taxes and costs hurt)
- Anyone seeking significant tax exemptions
- Veterans who want to escape the DC area's traffic and chaos

**Bottom Line:** Maryland is worth it if you're working high-income defense jobs or need excellent VA care. Otherwise, the taxes aren't justified by the benefits.

## #5: Maine - Rugged, Isolated, Mixed Benefits

**Winner:** Beautiful landscapes, low population density, partially exempt military retirement.

**Loser:** Limited VA access, harsh winters, limited job market.

Maine is for people who value solitude, natural beauty, and independence over convenience and robust services.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Partially exempt (up to $10,000 for those 65+).
- **Property taxes:** High rates, limited veteran exemptions.
- **Income tax:** Progressive rates up to 7.15%.

### VA Healthcare

- **Togus VA Medical Center** (Augusta) is the main facility.
- Several community-based clinics.
- Rural areas require long drives.

Togus is a historic facility but doesn't offer the cutting-edge specialty care you'd find in Boston or Philadelphia.

### Cost of Living

Southern Maine (Portland area) is expensive. Coastal properties are pricey. Inland and northern Maine are much cheaper but also more isolated.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who value outdoor lifestyle (fishing, hunting, hiking)
- Anyone seeking peace and quiet away from crowds
- Folks who want four seasons and don't mind cold winters
- Independent-minded people who don't need constant access to services

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans who need frequent VA care
- Anyone who hates long, brutal winters
- Job seekers (opportunities are limited outside Portland/Augusta)

**Bottom Line:** Maine is a lifestyle choice, not a financial optimization. Go for the scenery and solitude, not the benefits.

## #6: Massachusetts - Pay to Play

**Winner:** World-class VA healthcare (Boston VA, Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury), strong education benefits, robust economy.

**Loser:** High taxes, pathetic exemptions, insane cost of living.

Massachusetts offers some of the best healthcare and education in the nation—and charges you accordingly.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Only $1,500 is exempt. Yes, you read that right—fifteen hundred dollars.
- **Property taxes:** High, with minimal veteran exemptions.
- **State income tax:** Flat 5% (recently reduced from 5.25%).

### VA Healthcare

- **VA Boston Healthcare System** (Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury, Brockton) is consistently ranked among the nation's best.
- **Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital** (Bedford) serves northeast MA.
- Excellent access to cutting-edge medical care and research.

If you have complex health issues, Boston VA is one of the best places in the country for care.

### Education Benefits

Massachusetts offers excellent benefits for veterans and dependents attending state universities and colleges. If you or your kids are using GI Bill benefits, the state schools here are top-notch (UMass, state colleges).

### Cost of Living

Boston metro area is brutally expensive—among the highest in the nation. Even "affordable" suburbs are pricey. Western Massachusetts (Springfield, Berkshires) is cheaper but still not cheap.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans with serious health conditions who need the best VA care
- Anyone prioritizing education for themselves or dependents
- Folks transitioning into biotech, healthcare, or higher ed careers
- Service members who grew up here and want to stay

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (taxes and costs will eat you alive)
- Anyone seeking tax breaks (they don't exist here)
- Veterans who want to feel appreciated (the state doesn't offer much financially)

**Bottom Line:** Massachusetts makes sense only if you need its world-class healthcare or educational opportunities—not for financial benefits.

## #7: Vermont - Expensive Independence

**Winner:** Beautiful landscapes, strong sense of community, partial tax exemption.

**Loser:** High taxes, expensive living, very limited VA care, brutal winters.

Vermont is gorgeous and quirky, but it's not particularly veteran-friendly from a benefits standpoint.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $10,000.
- **Property taxes:** High, with modest veteran exemptions.
- **Income tax:** Progressive rates up to 8.75% (among the highest in the nation).

### VA Healthcare

- **White River Junction VA Medical Center** is the only VA hospital in Vermont.
- It's well-regarded but small.
- Rural Vermont requires long drives for care.

### Cost of Living

Vermont is expensive—property costs, heating bills (winters are brutal), and general goods all run high. The trade-off is safety, natural beauty, and a strong sense of community.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who prioritize outdoor lifestyle (skiing, hiking, hunting)
- Anyone who values small-town living and community
- Folks who don't mind isolation and self-reliance
- People who can afford it (retirees with pensions plus other income)

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans on tight budgets
- Anyone who needs frequent VA care
- People who hate cold, snowy winters
- Job seekers (opportunities are very limited)

**Bottom Line:** Vermont is a lifestyle choice for people with money who want natural beauty and independence—not a benefits play.

## #8: Rhode Island - Small State, Limited Benefits

**Winner:** Compact size (everything is close), disabled veteran tax exemption, coastal living.

**Loser:** Expensive, limited VA care, high taxes for most veterans.

Rhode Island is tiny—you can drive across the state in 45 minutes. It offers some benefits, but they're narrow in scope.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Fully exempt for veterans with VA-rated disabilities. Partial exemption for others.
- **Property taxes:** High, with limited veteran exemptions.

### VA Healthcare

- **Providence VA Medical Center** is the main facility.
- It's small but adequate for basic care.
- Boston VA is an hour away for specialty care.

### Cost of Living

Rhode Island is expensive—Newport and coastal areas especially. Providence and suburbs are cheaper but still pricey by national standards.

### Who Should Move Here

- Disabled veterans who'll get the full tax exemption
- Anyone who loves sailing and coastal living
- Folks who want access to Boston without living there
- People who grew up in RI and want to stay

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans without disability ratings (you'll pay full state tax)
- Anyone seeking robust veteran benefits
- Budget-conscious retirees

**Bottom Line:** Rhode Island is fine if you're disabled and love the coast—but there are better options in the region.

## #9: Connecticut - High Costs, Limited Relief

**Winner:** Good VA access, strong economy, safe communities.

**Loser:** Very high taxes, expensive living, modest veteran benefits.

Connecticut is wealthy, safe, and convenient—but it doesn't offer much to veterans beyond basic services.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Partially exempt (50% for those 55+, 100% for those 65+).
- **Property taxes:** Very high, minimal veteran exemptions.
- **Income tax:** Progressive rates up to 6.99%.

### VA Healthcare

- **West Haven VA Medical Center** is well-regarded.
- **Newington VA** offers outpatient services.
- Good access across the state.

### Cost of Living

Connecticut is expensive—Fairfield County (NYC suburbs) especially. Even rural areas aren't cheap. Property taxes are crushing.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans working high-income jobs in NYC/Hartford/Boston areas
- Anyone who grew up here and wants to stay
- Folks who prioritize safety and school quality (if raising kids)

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (taxes hurt)
- Anyone seeking veteran-specific benefits
- People who want affordability

**Bottom Line:** Connecticut offers quality of life but poor financial benefits for veterans. Only move here if you have other strong reasons.

---

## #10: New York - Big State, Big Taxes

**Winner:** Excellent VA facilities (Bronx, Manhattan, Buffalo), massive job market, cultural amenities.

**Loser:** Very high taxes, insane cost of living (NYC area), property taxes are crushing.

New York is huge and diverse—NYC is a world unto itself, while upstate is rural and affordable. But the taxes hit hard almost everywhere.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $40,120 (not terrible, but still capped).
- **Property taxes:** Among the highest in the nation, with limited veteran exemptions.
- **State income tax:** Progressive rates up to 10.9% (one of the highest).

### VA Healthcare

- **Manhattan VA** and **Bronx VA** offer excellent care.
- **Buffalo VA** serves western NY.
- **Albany VA** covers the capital region.
- **Syracuse VA** and others fill in the map.

New York's VA system is strong, especially in urban areas.

### Cost of Living

NYC metro is insanely expensive. Long Island is brutal. Upstate (Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany) is much more affordable but still not cheap by national standards.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans transitioning into finance, tech, healthcare, or media (NYC job market)
- Anyone who needs cutting-edge VA care
- Folks who want cultural amenities (museums, restaurants, arts)
- Service members who grew up here

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (taxes will wreck you)
- Anyone seeking tax-friendly retirement
- Veterans who want space and affordability

**Bottom Line:** New York makes sense if you're working high-income jobs or need top-tier VA care. It's a terrible retirement destination from a tax perspective.

---

## #11: New Jersey - The Tax King

**Winner:** Excellent location (between NYC/Philly), strong VA access, recently improved tax exemption.

**Loser:** Second-highest property taxes in the nation, expensive living, crushing state taxes.

New Jersey is notorious for taxes—and it's earned that reputation. Recent improvements to the military retirement exemption help, but it's still a tough state financially.

### Tax Situation

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $100,000 (this changed recently and is a significant improvement).
- **Property taxes:** Second-highest in the nation (average over $9,000/year). Veterans get a $250 annual property tax deduction. Yes, $250. It's insulting.
- **State income tax:** Progressive rates up to 10.75%.

### VA Healthcare

- **East Orange VA Medical Center** is solid.
- **Lyons VA Medical Center** serves central NJ.
- Several outpatient clinics.
- Easy access to NYC and Philadelphia VA facilities.

### Cost of Living

New Jersey is expensive everywhere—even the "cheap" areas. North Jersey (NYC suburbs) is astronomical. Central and South Jersey are cheaper but still pricey.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans working high-income jobs in NYC or Philly
- Anyone who grew up here and wants to stay near family
- Folks who need access to multiple major VA systems

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (property taxes will destroy you)
- Anyone seeking veteran-friendly tax policies
- Veterans who want affordability

**Bottom Line:** New Jersey's recent improvement to the military retirement exemption helps, but property taxes are still brutal. Only live here if you have compelling personal reasons.

## The Northeast Reality Check

Let's be honest: most of the Northeast isn't winning awards for veteran benefits. High taxes, high costs, and limited exemptions define the region.

**But there are exceptions:**

- **Pennsylvania** is genuinely excellent—full military retirement exemption and strong property tax relief for disabled vets.
- **New Hampshire** works if you're disabled and value freedom (no income tax, massive property exemptions).
- **Delaware** is a reasonable compromise for beach lovers.

**The rest?** You're paying for location, job opportunities, healthcare access, or family proximity—not for generous veteran benefits.

If you're tied to the Northeast for work or family, focus on Pennsylvania or New Hampshire. If you're free to move anywhere, look beyond this region unless you have specific healthcare or career needs that justify the costs.

**The Northeast won't roll out the red carpet for you—but a few states at least acknowledge your service with real financial benefits.**
