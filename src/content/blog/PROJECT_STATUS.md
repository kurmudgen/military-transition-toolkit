## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

**Decision needed:** Which approach do you prefer?

1. **Continue with highest quality** for top MOSs only (75-80 total)
2. **Complete all Army scripts** first (44 more), then move to other branches
3. **Hybrid approach** - detailed for common MOSs, templates for others
4. **Pause and prioritize** - tell me which specific scripts are most valuable

Once you decide, I can continue with that approach immediately.
