## Bottom Line Up Front

**Increasing from 70% to 100% is challenging but achievable.** The gap between 70% and 100% represents severe, disabling conditions. Success requires documenting severe functional impairment across multiple domains or identifying new conditions. Strategic options: (1) Increase existing conditions to higher ratings; (2) Add new service-connected conditions; (3) Claim TDIU (100% compensation without rating increase, faster/easier). Processing time 120-180 days for rating increase; approval rates 20-30% for direct 100% claims. TDIU often more achievable path to 100% compensation (approval rates 50-65% if unemployable).

## Understanding the 70% to 100% Gap

### Rating Philosophy
- **70% rating** = Severe disabilities with significant functional impairment
- **100% rating** = Essentially unable to work or function in most capacities; requires extensive medical care/treatment
- **Gap definition** = Not just "worse," but qualitatively different disability level

### Examples of 100% Conditions
- Severe TBI with major cognitive impairment
- Severe PTSD preventing all employment/functioning
- Severe blindness (both eyes)
- Severe paralysis
- Severe dementia
- Multiple severe conditions combining to 100%
- Terminal conditions

### Why Direct 100% Rating Difficult
- VA rates conservatively; 100% reserved for truly severe cases
- Functional impairment must be extraordinary
- Most 70% veterans fall short of 100% severity threshold
- Alternative (TDIU) available for unemployability-based compensation

---

## Strategy 1: Increase Existing High-Rated Conditions

### Analyzing Current Rating
- Review your 70% rating decision
- Identify conditions making up rating
- Example: PTSD 50% + back pain 20% + sleep disorder 10% = 70% combined
- Focus on highest-rated conditions for increase potential

### Documentation Needed
- Recent medical records showing worsening symptoms
- New functional impairment documentation
- Change in medical treatment (more medications, more frequent medical visits)
- Work-related impacts (inability to maintain employment)
- Increased medical care needs
- New specialist evaluation/recommendations

### Effective Approach
1. **Request specialist evaluation** for highest-rated condition
2. **Document functional worsening** since last rating
3. **Gather objective evidence**: test results, imaging, measurements
4. **Submit supplemental claim** with comprehensive new documentation
5. **Request increased rating** specifically to next level

### Examples of Rating Progression

**PTSD Example:**
- Current 50%; you document severe worsening
- Additional evidence: NEW psychiatric evaluation, detailed symptom documentation, hospitalization records, employment attempts showing failure
- Increase to 70%+
- Multiple conditions combined reach 100%

**Chronic Pain Example:**
- Current 40% back condition; claim 50%+ with documentation of increased pain, failed treatments, increased disability
- Combined with other conditions approach 100%

## Strategy 2: Add New Service-Connected Conditions

### Identifying New Conditions
Review your service and health history:
- Conditions since service connected to military service?
- Secondary conditions to your current rated conditions?
- Presumptive conditions you haven't claimed (Agent Orange, burn pit, etc.)?
- Conditions worsening due to service-connected disability?

### Valuable Secondary Conditions
- **Secondary to PTSD**: insomnia, migraines, hypertension, weight gain, anxiety disorders
- **Secondary to back injury**: sciatica, arthritis, functional limitation conditions
- **Secondary to TBI**: cognitive impairment, pain, sleep disorders
- **Presumptive conditions**: If applicable (burn pit, Agent Orange, radiation)

### Filing Strategy
1. **Identify potential new conditions** to add to current claim
2. **Obtain medical evaluation/diagnosis** for new conditions
3. **Get nexus letters** establishing connection to service or existing service-connected condition
4. **File supplemental claim** for multiple new conditions
5. **Calculate combined rating** showing path to 100%

### Example Combined Rating Path
- Current: PTSD 50% + back pain 20% = 60%
- New: Add PTSD-related insomnia 10% + medication-related weight gain/hypertension 10% + secondary anxiety 10%
- New conditions could increase combined rating to 80-90%
- Additional conditions or rating increases get to 100%

## Strategy 3: TDIU - 100% Compensation Without Rating Increase (Often Easier)

### Key Advantage
- Receive 100% monthly compensation WITHOUT achieving 100% rating
- Required: 70% rating + evidence of unemployability
- Often easier than getting 100% rating increase (50-65% approval vs. 20-30%)
- Faster processing (4-6 months vs. 12+ months for rating increase)

### TDIU Eligibility with 70% Rating
- You automatically meet rating threshold (70% ≥ 60% requirement)
- Only remaining requirement: Prove you cannot work due to service-connected disabilities

### Evidence for TDIU
- Medical provider statement: "Cannot maintain gainful employment due to service-connected conditions"
- Functional limitation documentation showing work impossibility
- Work history showing employment failure since disability onset
- Medical necessity for unable to work
- Family corroboration

### TDIU Advantages vs. Direct 100% Rating
| Factor | Direct 100% | TDIU |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Approval Rate | 20-30% | 50-65% |
| Timeline | 12-24 months | 4-6 months |
| Evidence Standard | Very high | More reasonable |
| Monthly Compensation | 100% rate | 100% rate |
| Conditions Required | Single very severe or multiple conditions | Must show unemployability |

## Evidence Requirements for 70% to 100% Rating Increase

### Medical Documentation
- **Recent** (within 6 months) medical records showing current status
- **Objective evidence**: Test results, imaging, measurements
- **Provider statements** addressing specific functional impairment
- **Specialist evaluations**: New opinions from treating providers
- **Functional assessment**: Occupational therapy, functional capacity evaluation
- **Multiple provider perspectives** if available

### Functional Impairment Documentation
- **Concrete, specific examples**: Not "can't do much," but "can't sit more than 30 minutes," "can't lift more than 5 lbs," "can't leave home due to agoraphobia"
- **Daily activity impact**: Examples of specific ADL impairments
- **Work impact**: Why unable to maintain employment specifically
- **Medical treatment intensity**: Hospitalizations, ER visits, specialist appointments, medication changes
- **Quality of life** impact documentation

### Supporting Documents
- **Employment records**: Job terminations, failed employment attempts related to disability
- **Medical treatment records**: Frequency of medical visits, hospitalizations, ER visits showing increasing need
- **Medication history**: Changes indicating worsening, medication additions
- **Family corroboration**: Statement describing worsening condition, impact on functioning

## Step-by-Step Rating Increase Process

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Situation (Week 1)
- Review rating decision
- Identify highest-rated conditions
- Determine if worsening objectively documented
- Calculate combined rating with potential new conditions
- Decide: Direct 100% increase vs. TDIU claim?

### Step 2: Obtain Medical Evaluation (Weeks 1-6)
- Request VA specialist evaluation for highest-rated conditions
- Request private specialist if desired (stronger impact sometimes)
- Focus on functional impairment
- Ensure new evaluation documents specificity of limitations

### Step 3: Gather Comprehensive Documentation (Weeks 2-8)
- Collect all recent medical records
- Document employment history since last rating
- Gather work-related impact examples
- Request family statement if applicable
- Compile functional impairment examples

### Step 4: File Supplemental Claim (Week 9)
**Use Form 21-0960 (Supplemental Claim):**
- Request rating increase from 70% to 100%
- Explain why conditions now warrant higher rating
- Reference specific VA rating schedules
- Provide narrative explaining functional impairment

**Sample Narrative:**
"I am claiming rating increase from 70% to 100% due to significant worsening of service-connected conditions. My PTSD has become severely disabling, preventing any employment. I am providing new psychiatric evaluation documenting severe symptoms, unable to work due to PTSD severity. My back condition has also worsened significantly, confirmed by recent imaging. Combined, these conditions now warrant 100% rating. Additionally, I am claiming TDIU as alternative basis for 100% compensation based on documented unemployability."

### Step 5: Submit Complete Evidence (Week 10)
- Form 21-0960
- Current VA rating decision
- All new medical evidence
- Specialist evaluations
- Functional impairment documentation
- Employment history documentation
- Family corroboration if applicable
- If filing TDIU alternative: Form 21-8940 as backup

### Step 6: File and Track (Week 11+)
- File at VA.gov (preferred) or mail
- Monitor claim status
- Respond to any VA requests immediately
- Prepare for C&P exam if scheduled

## TDIU as Alternative Path

### When TDIU Makes Sense
- You have 70%+ rating (already meet threshold)
- You cannot work due to service-connected disabilities
- You'd prefer faster 100% compensation route
- Approval likelihood higher than direct 100% increase

### Filing Both Strategies
- File Supplemental Claim requesting 100% rating increase
- Simultaneously file for TDIU (Form 21-8940)
- If rating increase denied, TDIU claim still pending
- Many successful TDIU claims when direct 100% denied

### TDIU Advantages
- Faster processing (4-6 months vs. 12+ months)
- Higher approval rates (50-65% vs. 20-30%)
- Same monthly compensation as 100% rating
- More achievable standard (unemployability vs. extreme severity)

## Real Examples

### Success Example: Increased PTSD 50% to 70% + New Secondary Condition Added

**Original Rating:** 70% combined (PTSD 50% + back pain 20%)

**Strategy:** Supplemental claim requesting PTSD increase to 70% + add insomnia secondary

**Evidence:**
- New VA psychiatry evaluation documenting severe PTSD worsening
- Sleep study showing severe sleep disruption
- Detailed functional impairment documentation
- New employment attempt that failed due to PTSD symptoms
- Family statement describing worsened condition

**Outcome:**
- PTSD increased to 70%
- Insomnia secondary approved at 10%
- New combined rating: 80%
- Partial success; not 100% but significant improvement

**Next Step:** Could file TDIU claim if unable to work, or file another supplemental with additional evidence for remaining distance to 100%.

### TDIU Success vs. Failed 100% Increase

**Veteran:** Rated 70% (PTSD 50% + back pain 20%)

**Strategy A (Failed):** Filed supplemental claim requesting 100% rating increase
- Denied: "While conditions severe, do not meet 100% rating criteria"
- Approval rate for this path: 20-30%

**Strategy B (Succeeded):** Filed TDIU claim
- Evidence: Cannot work due to PTSD + back pain
- Approval: 100% compensation via TDIU
- Approval rate for this path: 50-65%
- Same monthly compensation as 100% rating
- Much faster (6 months vs. 24 months for failed rating increase)

**Key Lesson:** TDIU often more achievable path to 100% compensation when direct rating increase unlikely.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Insufficient New Evidence
**Mistake:** Filing without recent medical documentation showing objective change.

**Fix:** Ensure new evidence shows clear worsening/new conditions since last rating.

### 2. Vague Functional Documentation
**Mistake:** "Conditions worse" without specific examples.

**Fix:** Concrete examples: "Cannot sit 8 hours," "Cannot lift 10 lbs," "Cannot leave home."

### 3. Overlooking TDIU Alternative
**Mistake:** Fighting for 100% rating increase when TDIU available and more achievable.

**Fix:** Evaluate TDIU option; often faster/easier path to 100% compensation.

### 4. Poor Timing
**Mistake:** Filing increase claim immediately after last claim without new evidence.

**Fix:** Wait until clear, objective worsening documented; fresh evidence stronger.

### 5. Weak Secondary Conditions
**Mistake:** Claiming secondary conditions without strong nexus letters.

**Fix:** Strong nexus letters from medical providers critical for secondary condition approval.

## Timeline

### Rating Increase: 120-180 Days Typical
- Supplemental claim: 4-6 months
- C&P exam possible: adds 4-8 weeks
- Complex cases: 6+ months

### TDIU: 60-120 Days Typical
- Filing to decision: 4-6 months
- C&P functional exam likely: 4-8 weeks
- Faster than rating increase appeal

## Final Recommendation

**Achieving 100% is challenging from 70% rating.** Consider two-pronged approach:
1. **Primary:** File Supplemental Claim requesting 100% rating with comprehensive new evidence
2. **Alternative:** File TDIU claim (100% compensation if unable to work; higher approval likelihood)

If rating increase denied, TDIU claim often succeeds. Same monthly compensation either way.

**Next Steps:**
1. Evaluate which strategy fits your situation
2. Gather comprehensive new medical evidence
3. File appropriate claim(s) at VA.gov
4. Work with VSO for representation
5. Be prepared for C&P exam with specific examples

**Strategic Choice:** File both rating increase and TDIU simultaneously. Whichever succeeds achieves 100% compensation goal.
