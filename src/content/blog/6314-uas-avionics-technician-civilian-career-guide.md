## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Your 6314 technical skills are solid. But there are civilian-side gaps you need to address.

**FAA regulations and civilian aviation procedures:** Military aviation operates under different rules than civilian aviation. You'll need to learn FAA Part 43 (maintenance regulations), Part 91 (general operating rules), Part 107 (drone rules), and how civilian maintenance documentation works. The Part 107 study process covers most of this.

**Customer service and client communication:** In the Marines, you reported to your SNCOIC and maintenance officer. In civilian jobs, you'll often interact directly with customers or non-technical managers. They don't want to hear "The AFCS is deadlined until we receive a CASREP from NALCOMIS." Learn to explain technical issues in simple terms: "The navigation system needs a replacement component. It'll be ready in 3 days once the part arrives."

**Civilian workplace culture:** No more "Aye, Sergeant." Civilian workplaces are less formal. You'll call people by first names, including managers. Office politics exist. People take smoke breaks and chat. Adjust your expectations. Show up on time, work hard, and communicate professionally—your military work ethic will stand out in a good way.

**Business operations and profit motives:** Military maintenance focuses on mission readiness. Civilian companies focus on profit. You'll hear about "billable hours," "customer contracts," and "cost efficiency." Understand that every hour you work costs the company money, and every hour you bill to customers makes money. Be efficient and document your time.

**Self-directed learning:** The Marine Corps sent you to formal schools and provided technical manuals. Civilian employers expect you to seek out training, YouTube videos, and Google searches to solve problems. Develop the habit of independent research and troubleshooting beyond what's in the official manual.

## Real 6314 success stories

**Mike, 27, former 6314 UAS Avionics Technician → Defense Contractor with General Atomics**

After 5 years as a 6314 working on RQ-7 Shadow systems, Mike separated as a Sergeant. He applied directly to General Atomics field service technician positions supporting MQ-9 Reaper operations. His Secret clearance and hands-on UAS experience made him a top candidate. Started at $72,000 as a field service tech at Holloman AFB. After 3 years, now makes $95,000 as a senior avionics technician supporting OCONUS operations. Works hard but says the pay and technical work beat anything he could've found without years of additional schooling.
