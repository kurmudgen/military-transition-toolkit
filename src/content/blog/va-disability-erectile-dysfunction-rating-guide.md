# VA Disability Rating for Erectile Dysfunction: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 7522** with a **0% rating** for loss of erectile power. However, ED qualifies for **Special Monthly Compensation (SMC-K)** which provides an **additional monthly payment** (approximately $131/month) on top of your regular compensation. ED is almost always claimed as **secondary** to another service-connected condition (diabetes, hypertension, PTSD, medications, prostate conditions). The key is establishing the nexus between your ED and a service-connected condition. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## Understanding ED Compensation

### The 0% Rating Explained

ED receives a **0% schedular rating**, which means:
- No monthly compensation for the 0% rating itself
- **BUT** you become eligible for SMC-K
- SMC-K pays approximately **$131.44/month** (2024 rate) in addition to regular compensation
- ED also counts as a service-connected condition for other purposes

### Special Monthly Compensation (SMC-K)

SMC-K is paid for:
- Loss of use of a creative organ (reproductive organ)
- This includes erectile dysfunction
- Payment is in addition to your regular compensation percentage
- Can be combined with other SMC levels

**Example:** A veteran with 70% PTSD receives $1,716.28/month. If ED is also service-connected, they receive $1,716.28 + $131.44 = $1,847.72/month.

## VA Rating Criteria

### DC 7522 - Penis, Deformity, with Loss of Erectile Power

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **20%** | Penis deformity with loss of erectile power |
| **0%** | Loss of erectile power alone (without deformity) |

**Note:** Most veterans receive 0% for ED alone. The 20% rating requires both physical deformity AND loss of erectile power.

### Special Monthly Compensation

- **SMC-K**: Loss of use of creative organ - approximately $131/month additional
- Automatically considered when ED is service-connected

## Common Causes of Secondary ED

ED is almost always claimed as **secondary** to another service-connected condition:

### Diabetes (Most Common)
- Diabetes damages blood vessels and nerves needed for erections
- Strong medical literature supports this connection
- If you have service-connected diabetes + ED, the nexus is well-established

### Hypertension
- High blood pressure damages blood vessels
- Many hypertension medications cause ED as a side effect

### PTSD/Mental Health Conditions
- PTSD directly affects sexual function
- Medications (SSRIs, SNRIs) commonly cause ED
- Anxiety and depression impact sexual function

### Prostate Conditions
- Prostate cancer treatment
- Prostatectomy
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
- Prostate radiation

### Spinal/Neurological Conditions
- Lower back conditions affecting nerve function
- Spinal cord injuries
- Radiculopathy

### Heart Disease
- Cardiovascular disease affects blood flow
- Heart medications can cause ED

### Medications
- Blood pressure medications
- Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)
- Pain medications
- Anti-anxiety medications

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence

**For secondary ED:**
- Current service-connected condition that can cause ED
- Nexus opinion linking ED to service-connected condition
- Medical literature supporting the connection
- Timeline showing ED developed after primary condition

**For medication-induced ED:**
- Documentation of service-connected condition requiring medication
- Medication known to cause ED
- Timeline of medication use and ED onset

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Diagnosis from urologist or primary care
- Physical examination
- Documentation of erectile dysfunction

### Nexus Evidence
- Medical opinion linking ED to service-connected condition
- Can be from treating physician, private doctor, or IMO
- Should cite medical literature when appropriate

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Ask about erectile function
3. Review medications
4. Examine for deformity (if claimed)
5. Review service-connected conditions
6. Provide nexus opinion

**What to tell them:**
- When ED started
- What causes you believe contributed
- Impact on relationships
- Any treatment tried (Viagra, Cialis, etc.)
- Service-connected conditions you have

**Be honest but thorough** - this is a medical condition, not something to be embarrassed about discussing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What rating do I get for ED?
ED alone receives a 0% rating, but you qualify for SMC-K (approximately $131/month additional compensation).

### Can I claim ED as a primary condition?
It's possible but rare. Most ED claims are secondary to diabetes, hypertension, PTSD, medications, or other service-connected conditions.

### Do I need to try Viagra/Cialis before claiming?
No. You don't need to prove treatment failure. Simply having ED that's connected to service is sufficient.

### What if my ED is from medications?
If you take medications for a service-connected condition and those medications cause ED, you can claim ED as secondary.

### Is this embarrassing to discuss at the C&P exam?
Many veterans feel awkward, but examiners are medical professionals who evaluate this condition regularly. Be honest and straightforward.

### Can ED be secondary to PTSD?
Yes. PTSD commonly affects sexual function both directly and through medications used to treat it.

### What if I have multiple conditions that could cause ED?
List all service-connected conditions that may contribute. The examiner will evaluate which, if any, are at least as likely as not to have caused your ED.

### Does the VA provide ED medications?
Yes. If service-connected for ED, the VA can provide medications like Viagra or Cialis through the pharmacy.

## Secondary Conditions

**ED can be secondary to:**
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- PTSD/depression/anxiety
- Heart disease
- Prostate conditions
- Spinal conditions
- Medications for any service-connected condition

**ED can cause:**
- Depression (may support increased mental health rating)
- Relationship problems (document impact)

## Common Denial Reasons and Appeals

### Denial Reasons
1. No nexus opinion linking ED to service-connected condition
2. ED attributed to age or non-service factors
3. No diagnosis of ED in medical records
4. Primary condition not service-connected

### Appeal Strategies
- Obtain nexus letter from urologist
- Get Independent Medical Opinion (IMO)
- Cite medical literature linking your condition to ED
- Document timeline clearly (when ED started vs. when primary condition developed)
