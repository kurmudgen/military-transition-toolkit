## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "Performed maintenance on aircraft avionics." Civilians don't understand that. Here's how to translate:

| Military Skill | Civilian Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Troubleshot radar systems | Diagnosed and repaired complex radar and navigation systems valued at $2M+ |
| Component-level repair | Performed circuit board-level troubleshooting and electronics component replacement |
| Used test equipment | Operated advanced diagnostic equipment including oscilloscopes, multimeters, and avionics test sets |
| Maintained aircraft systems | Maintained accountability for mission-critical avionics systems with 99.8% operational readiness |
| Technical manual compliance | Interpreted and executed detailed technical procedures with zero-defect standards |
| O-level maintenance | Performed on-aircraft troubleshooting, removal, and installation of avionics components |
| I-level maintenance | Conducted bench-level repair and testing of avionics circuit boards and modules |
| Fiber optics work | Installed and tested fiber optic data transmission systems |
| Work center supervision | Led team of 3-6 technicians in aircraft electronics maintenance operations |

Use **active verbs**: Diagnosed, Repaired, Tested, Installed, Maintained, Supervised, Operated.

Use **numbers**: "Maintained 12 aircraft avionics systems," "Completed 200+ maintenance actions with zero defects," "Supervised team of 5 technicians."

Translate acronyms. Don't write "ALSS" or "NALCOMIS." Write out "Aviation Life Support Systems" or just describe what you did in plain English.

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill benefits:

### High priority (get these):

**FCC GROL with Radar Endorsement** - Legally required to work on aircraft transmitters and radar systems. Pass three written exams (Elements 1, 3, and 8). Cost: $35 FCC application fee. Study materials: $50-$200. Lifetime certificate. Do this first—it's quick and opens doors immediately. Value: Required for most avionics jobs.

**FAA Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) license** - The gold standard for aircraft maintenance. Opens doors at every major airline and aviation company. Requirements: 18-24 months training at FAA-approved school OR 30 months documented aviation maintenance experience (your Navy time may qualify you for the experience route). Cost: $15,000-$30,000 for school (GI Bill covers it). Written, oral, and practical exams. Value: Significantly increases hiring opportunities and salary potential.

**Navy COOL certifications** - Use your COOL account to get civilian credentials before you separate. ATs are eligible for Electronics Technician (ET) certifications, NCATT AET (Aviation Electronics Technician), and others. Many are free or low-cost. Value: Adds credentials to your resume immediately.

### Medium priority (if it fits your path):

**Manufacturer-specific certifications** - Garmin, Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, etc. Usually earned after you're hired, but if you have the opportunity through SkillBridge or Navy COOL, grab them. Cost: Varies (often employer-paid). Value: Makes you more competitive for specific roles.

**AS9100/ISO 9001 quality training** - Quality management system certification relevant to aerospace. Shows you understand civilian quality standards. Cost: $500-$1,500. Value: Helpful for quality assurance or lead technician roles.

**Associate's or Bachelor's degree in Electronics/Avionics** - Not required for technician roles, but helps for career progression into engineering, management, or specialized positions. Use your GI Bill. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Value: Long-term career advancement.

### Low priority (nice to have, not critical):

**Private Pilot License** - Some avionics techs pursue this for better understanding of systems. Cost: $8,000-$15,000. Value: Personal interest more than career necessity.

**CompTIA A+ or other IT certs** - Relevant if you're pivoting toward IT, but not directly applicable to avionics work. Cost: $300-$500. Value: Low for traditional avionics paths.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Let's be honest. There are civilian-specific things you'll need to adapt to.

**FAA regulations vs. Navy procedures:** Civilian aviation follows FAA regulations (14 CFR) instead of NAVAIR instructions. The logic is the same—safety-first, follow the book—but the specific regulations are different. You'll learn this on the job or in A&P school.

**Customer service mindset:** In the Navy, the aircraft belonged to the squadron. In civilian aviation, you're serving customers—airlines, corporate flight departments, private owners. You'll need to communicate clearly, manage expectations, and maintain professional relationships. It's still technical work, but with more interpersonal interaction.

**Civilian documentation standards:** Military maintenance records are detailed. Civilian records are equally detailed but formatted differently. You'll adapt quickly, but expect a learning curve with civilian logbook entries, work order systems, and maintenance tracking software.

**Pace and priorities:** Civilian aviation operates on tight schedules. An aircraft out of service costs money—lots of it. You'll feel pressure to work quickly while maintaining quality. Your Navy training in working under pressure translates directly, but the business urgency is different than mission urgency.
