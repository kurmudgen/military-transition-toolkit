# Military to Border Patrol/CBP: Your Complete Transition Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) offers veterans stable federal careers with starting salaries of $52,000-$70,000 (with overtime) and journey-level agents/officers earning $85,000-$120,000+. As the largest federal law enforcement agency (60,000+ employees), CBP actively recruits veterans with hiring preference and accelerated processing. Your military discipline, weapons proficiency, and experience in challenging environments translate directly. Most veterans can complete the hiring process within 4-9 months. Border Patrol has particularly aggressive hiring with frequent recruitment.

## Why Veterans Excel at CBP

Military discipline and physical capability align with CBP requirements. You've operated in demanding conditions—Border Patrol work in desert, mountain, and rural environments is familiar territory.

Your weapons proficiency reduces training time and improves safety. CBP recognizes military firearms training.

Experience working in austere environments prepares you for Border Patrol operations. Southwest border assignments involve remote, harsh conditions.

Your ability to work independently while maintaining standards fits Border Patrol culture. Agents often patrol alone in remote areas.

Security clearances expedite hiring. CBP requires background investigations that your clearance helps facilitate.

Physical fitness from military service supports demanding patrol work. Border Patrol work involves foot pursuits, rough terrain, and physical confrontations.
