## The Core Strategy: Value-First Funnel

### Critical Insight
**The Paywall Problem**: Convince users MTT is worth $7/mo when many veteran resources are free.

**Solution**: Multi-stage value demonstration funnel

```
STAGE 1: Free High-Value Content (Awareness)
└─> SEO-optimized guides, career transition posts, state benefits
    └─> 80% of content available without login

STAGE 2: Free Tools Without Login (Interest)
└─> Salary calculator, MOS translator, timeline builder
    └─> Demonstrate platform capability, collect emails

STAGE 3: Lead Magnets (Consideration)
└─> 6,000-9,000 word comprehensive guides (email required)
    └─> Deep value exchange, nurture sequence begins

STAGE 4: Free Trial or Limited Access (Evaluation)
└─> 7-day full access OR premium feature preview
    └─> Experience full platform, build habit

STAGE 5: Paid Subscription (Conversion)
└─> $7/mo recurring or $49/yr (2 months free)
    └─> Continuous value: updates, new content, tools, community
```

**Key Differentiator**: MTT is not just content—it's a personalized transition management platform with tools, tracking, and community.

## The Path to $5K-$10K MRR

### Conservative Scenario ($5K MRR)
- 715 subscribers at $7/mo
- Requires: 1,800 trials (40% conversion rate)
- Requires: 36,000 engaged visitors (5% trial rate)
- Achievable with 100K monthly visitors (strong funnel)

### Target Scenario ($7.5K MRR)
- Mix of monthly and annual subscribers
  - 500 monthly ($7/mo) = $3,500
  - 100 annual ($49/yr = $4.08/mo) = $408
  - 10 lifetime ($249 one-time) = $2,490/month (amortized)
- Total = ~$7.5K MRR
- More sustainable (lower churn with annual/lifetime)

### Aggressive Scenario ($10K MRR)
- 1,000 monthly subscribers
- 100 annual subscribers
- 20 lifetime customers
- Requires: ~150K monthly visitors + optimized funnel
- Achievable with paid acquisition scaling Month 3

**Key Insight**: Revenue follows user acquisition. Focus on traffic + conversion optimization, revenue is the output.

## Conclusion: The 90-Day Mission

This strategy transforms 1,400+ content assets into a veteran-serving, revenue-generating ecosystem. Success requires:

1. **Relentless execution**: 3-4 hours daily, no excuses
2. **Data-driven optimization**: Measure everything, iterate weekly
3. **Genuine value delivery**: Help veterans first, revenue follows
4. **Multi-channel approach**: SEO + YouTube + partnerships + paid
5. **Systematic conversion**: Build trust before asking for payment

**Remember**: You're not selling software. You're selling a successful transition from military to civilian life. That's worth far more than $7/month.
