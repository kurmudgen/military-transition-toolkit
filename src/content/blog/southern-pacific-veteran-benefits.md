# Southern & Pacific Veteran Benefits: Final 6 States Compared

We've covered 44 states across four regional guides. Now we're wrapping up with the remaining six: Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina (Deep South), and California, Oregon, Hawaii (Pacific).

This is a weird mix—the Deep South states offer rock-bottom living costs but struggle with economic opportunity and healthcare access. The Pacific states are the opposite: high costs, high taxes, but world-class amenities and (in California's case) the best VA healthcare system in the nation.

If you're choosing between Alabama and California, you're not making an apples-to-apples comparison. You're making a lifestyle and priority decision that goes way beyond veteran benefits.

Let's break down these final six states and close out our 50-state tour.

## Quick Rankings: Final Six States

## #1: Oregon - Pacific Northwest Without Sales Tax

**Winner:** Military retirement fully exempt from state income tax, no sales tax, excellent VA care (Portland), beautiful landscapes.

**Loser:** High cost of living, high property taxes with limited veteran exemptions, gray weather.

Oregon is Washington's quirky sibling—similar climate and geography, but with its own tax structure and vibe.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** 100% exempt from state income tax. All of it, no caps.
- **No sales tax** (helps offset other costs).
- **Property taxes:** High rates (among the highest in the nation). Disabled veterans can get exemptions, but they're modest.

### VA Healthcare

- **VA Portland Health Care System** is excellent—one of the best in the Pacific Northwest.
- **Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center & Clinics** (White City) serves southern Oregon.
- **Roseburg VA Medical Center** covers the central coast.

Coverage is strong in urban areas, weaker in rural eastern Oregon.

### Cost of Living

Oregon is expensive—Portland metro area especially. Housing costs have skyrocketed. Property taxes are high. Rural areas are cheaper, but job opportunities disappear.

### The Culture Factor

Oregon is politically and culturally progressive in urban areas (Portland, Eugene), conservative in rural areas. The divide is stark. Make sure you're comfortable with the local culture wherever you land.

Weather is gray and rainy 9 months of the year. If you need sunshine for mental health, this ain't it.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want full military retirement tax exemption and excellent VA care
- Anyone who loves outdoor recreation (mountains, coast, forests)
- Folks who don't mind rain and gray skies
- Veterans transitioning into tech or outdoor industry jobs (Portland has opportunities)

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone on a tight budget (costs are high)
- Veterans who need sunshine
- People who hate property taxes (they're brutal)
- Anyone who wants strong veteran-specific property benefits

**Bottom Line:** Oregon offers full military retirement tax exemption and excellent VA care—but you'll pay for it with high costs and property taxes. It's a strong choice if you can afford it and fit the culture.

## #2: South Carolina - Southern Hospitality, Decent Benefits

**Winner:** Partial tax exemption (up to $30,000), affordable living, decent VA care, beach and mountain access.

**Loser:** Hot, humid summers, property tax benefits vary widely, economy is mixed.

South Carolina has become a popular retirement destination—especially for military retirees who served at Parris Island, Fort Jackson, or Charleston bases.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Exempt up to $30,000. Not amazing, but it helps.
- **Property taxes:** Vary by county. Some offer significant exemptions for disabled veterans; others offer little.

### VA Healthcare

- **Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center** (Charleston) is excellent—one of the best in the Southeast.
- **Dorn VA Medical Center** (Columbia) serves central SC.
- **Greenville VA Clinic** and other outpatient locations cover the rest.

Coverage is solid in urban areas, weaker in rural regions.

### Cost of Living

South Carolina is affordable—especially compared to North Carolina and Georgia. Charleston and coastal areas have gotten pricey, but Columbia, Greenville, and inland areas remain reasonable.

### Military Culture

South Carolina has deep military roots—Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, Fort Jackson, Charleston Air Force Base, Shaw Air Force Base. The veteran community is strong, and locals generally respect military service.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who served in SC and want to stay
- Anyone who wants affordable southern living with beach and mountain access
- Folks who enjoy warm weather (despite the summer humidity)
- Veterans who want access to excellent VA care in Charleston

### Who Should Avoid It

- High-earning retirees (the $30K cap means you'll pay state tax on income above that)
- Anyone who hates heat and humidity
- Veterans seeking maximum tax exemptions

**Bottom Line:** South Carolina is a solid, practical choice—decent exemptions, affordable living, strong military culture, and excellent VA care in Charleston.

## #3: Alabama - Sweet Home, Rock-Bottom Costs

**Winner:** Military retirement fully exempt, very low cost of living, good property tax benefits for disabled vets.

**Loser:** Limited VA care outside major cities, weak economy, limited cultural amenities.

Alabama doesn't make many "best places to live" lists—but for veterans on tight budgets, it delivers serious affordability.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** 100% exempt from state income tax. All of it, no caps.
- **Property taxes:** Among the lowest in the nation. Disabled veterans (100% rating) can get full exemptions in many counties.

### VA Healthcare

- **Birmingham VA Medical Center** is solid—the best in the state.
- **Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center** serves west Alabama.
- **Montgomery and Mobile** have outpatient clinics.
- Rural Alabama has limited access.

### Cost of Living

Alabama is **dirt cheap**. You can buy a house in many areas for under $150K. Property taxes are minimal (and exempt if you're 100% disabled). General living costs are among the lowest in the nation.

### The Reality Check

Alabama ranks near the bottom nationally in education, healthcare outcomes, and economic opportunity. If you're healthy, financially stable, and don't need much—it works. If you need services and opportunities, it's a struggle.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want full military retirement tax exemption and ultra-low costs
- 100% disabled veterans seeking property tax relief
- Anyone who wants to stretch retirement dollars as far as possible
- Folks who don't need extensive VA care or job opportunities

### Who Should Avoid It

- Veterans who need frequent, complex VA care
- Anyone seeking job opportunities and economic growth
- People who prioritize education and healthcare systems

**Bottom Line:** Alabama is a budget-optimization play—full tax exemption and rock-bottom costs. Just understand the trade-offs in services and opportunities.

## #4: Mississippi - The Cheapest State, Period

**Winner:** Military retirement fully exempt, lowest cost of living in the nation, decent property tax relief for disabled vets.

**Loser:** Worst VA healthcare access in the region, weakest economy, ranks last in many quality-of-life metrics.

Mississippi consistently ranks as the cheapest state to live in—and the poorest. That's the trade-off.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** 100% exempt from state income tax. No caps.
- **Property taxes:** Among the lowest in the nation. Disabled veterans can get exemptions (varies by county).

### VA Healthcare

- **G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center** (Jackson) is the only full VA hospital in Mississippi.
- Biloxi VA has outpatient services.
- Rural Mississippi requires long drives for care.

The VA system in Mississippi is limited. If you have complex health needs, this is a serious problem.

### Cost of Living

Mississippi is the **cheapest state in the nation**. Housing is absurdly affordable—you can buy a livable house for under $100K in many areas. Property taxes are minimal. Food and utilities are cheap.

Your military retirement will go further in Mississippi than anywhere else in the country.

### The Brutal Reality

Mississippi consistently ranks last or near-last in education, healthcare, economic opportunity, and quality of life metrics. Poverty is widespread. Infrastructure is aging.

If you're healthy, financially stable, and self-sufficient—Mississippi's low costs might work. If you need services, job opportunities, or quality healthcare—it's a tough state.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who want absolute maximum purchasing power for their retirement
- Anyone who wants to pay almost nothing for housing and property taxes
- Folks who don't need extensive VA care
- Veterans who are healthy and self-sufficient

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone who needs robust VA healthcare
- Veterans seeking job opportunities
- People who prioritize quality schools, infrastructure, and services

**Bottom Line:** Mississippi is the ultimate low-cost option—your dollars go further here than anywhere. But you're trading savings for services, opportunities, and quality of life.

## #5: California - The VA Healthcare Paradox

**Winner:** Best VA healthcare system in the nation (bar none), strong economy, world-class amenities, excellent weather (most regions).

**Loser:** Highest taxes in the nation, insane cost of living, military retirement is generally taxed.

California is the ultimate paradox for veterans: the worst tax environment combined with the best VA healthcare system.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Generally fully taxable at state income tax rates (up to 13.3%—highest in the nation).
- **Disability pay:** Tax-exempt (federal law).
- **Property taxes:** Protected by Proposition 13 (limited increases), but still high in absolute terms. Veterans get minimal additional breaks.

California will tax your military retirement like any other income. If you're a high earner, you'll pay through the nose.

### VA Healthcare: The Best in the Nation

This is where California shines. The VA healthcare system here is **world-class**:

- **VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System** is one of the largest and best in the country.
- **VA San Diego Healthcare System** is excellent.
- **VA Palo Alto Health Care System** is outstanding and affiliated with Stanford.
- **San Francisco VA Medical Center** is top-tier.
- **VA Long Beach Healthcare System** is solid.
- Dozens of community-based outpatient clinics statewide.

If you have complex health issues, need cutting-edge treatment, or want access to the best VA research and specialty care—California delivers like no other state.

### Cost of Living

California is brutally expensive. Median home prices in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Orange County are $700K-$1.5M+. Rent is astronomical. Gas is the most expensive in the nation. Sales tax is high. Income tax is crushing.

You can find cheaper areas (Central Valley, Inland Empire, rural Northern California)—but then you lose proximity to the best VA facilities and job markets.

### The Economy

California has the **largest economy in the U.S.** (5th largest in the world if it were a country). Job opportunities are abundant—tech, entertainment, aerospace, defense, healthcare, agriculture.

If you're transitioning and have skills, you can earn six figures in California. That might justify the tax hit.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans with serious health conditions who need the absolute best VA care
- Anyone transitioning into high-paying tech, aerospace, or defense jobs
- Folks who can afford it and value world-class amenities
- Veterans who want excellent weather (Southern California) and don't mind costs

### Who Should Avoid It

- Retirees on fixed incomes (taxes and costs will destroy you)
- Anyone seeking tax-friendly retirement (California is the worst)
- Veterans who don't need cutting-edge VA care (you're paying for access you may not use)

**Bottom Line:** California makes sense only if you need its world-class VA healthcare system or are earning high civilian income. For pure retirement on a military pension? It's financial suicide.

## #6: Hawaii - Paradise With a Price Tag

**Winner:** Unmatched natural beauty, unique culture, decent VA care, year-round perfect weather.

**Loser:** Highest cost of living in the nation, partial tax exemption, isolation, island fever.

Hawaii is the dream—tropical paradise, perfect weather, stunning landscapes. But you'll pay more to live here than anywhere else in the U.S.

### Tax Treatment

- **Military retirement:** Partially exempt. The exemption formula is complex and income-based—generally, you'll pay some state tax.
- **Property taxes:** Relatively low rates (surprisingly), but property values are astronomical, so absolute tax amounts are still high.

### VA Healthcare

- **VA Pacific Islands Health Care System** (Honolulu) is the main facility—solid, but not huge.
- Outer islands have limited access—you might need to fly to Oahu for specialty care.

Coverage is decent but limited by Hawaii's isolation. Complex cases may require mainland travel.

### Cost of Living

Hawaii has the **highest cost of living in the U.S.**:

- Median home price in Honolulu is $800K+. Maui and other islands are even worse.
- Groceries cost 50-70% more than the mainland (everything is shipped in).
- Gas is the most expensive in the nation (even more than California).
- Utilities are high (electricity especially).

Your military retirement will not go far in Hawaii. You need additional income, substantial savings, or a partner's income to live comfortably.

### The Island Reality

Hawaii is isolated—5+ hours by plane to the mainland. If you need to travel frequently for family or other reasons, it's expensive and time-consuming.

"Island fever" is real—some people love the limited geography and slower pace; others feel trapped after a few years.

### Who Should Move Here

- Veterans who grew up in Hawaii or served there and want to stay
- Anyone with substantial income beyond military retirement (high-paying remote work, investments, rental income)
- Folks who prioritize natural beauty and perfect weather above all else
- Veterans who don't need frequent mainland travel

### Who Should Avoid It

- Anyone on a tight budget (Hawaii will wreck you financially)
- Veterans who need extensive VA care (access is limited)
- People who need variety and mainland conveniences
- Anyone prone to feeling isolated or trapped

**Bottom Line:** Hawaii is paradise—if you can afford it. For most veterans living solely on military retirement, the costs outweigh the benefits. It's a lifestyle dream, not a financial optimization.

## Regional Comparison: Deep South vs. Pacific

These six states represent two extremes:

### Deep South (Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina)

**Pros:**
- Full or partial military retirement tax exemptions
- Rock-bottom cost of living
- Your dollars stretch far
- Strong military culture (especially SC)

**Cons:**
- Limited VA healthcare access (especially in rural areas)
- Weak economies and job markets
- Rank low in education, healthcare, and quality-of-life metrics
- Hot, humid summers

**Bottom Line:** The Deep South is a budget play. If you're healthy, financially stable, and want to maximize purchasing power—Alabama and Mississippi deliver. South Carolina offers a better balance of affordability and quality of life.

### Pacific States (California, Oregon, Hawaii)

**Pros:**
- Excellent VA healthcare (California especially)
- Strong economies and job opportunities
- Natural beauty and outdoor recreation
- Higher quality of life metrics

**Cons:**
- High taxes (California crushes you; Oregon and Hawaii take a bite)
- Extremely high cost of living
- Your military retirement alone won't cut it in California or Hawaii

**Bottom Line:** The Pacific states make sense if you're earning civilian income or need world-class VA care. For retirees living solely on military pensions, the costs are brutal.

## The Final 6 Bottom Line

**Best Overall Pick:** Oregon—full military retirement exemption, excellent VA care, beautiful landscapes. You'll pay with high costs and property taxes, but the benefits package is strong.

**Best Budget Pick:** Alabama—full military retirement exemption, rock-bottom costs. Trade-off is limited VA care and services.

**Best Lifestyle Pick:** Hawaii—if you can afford it and want paradise. But it's a luxury, not a practical choice for most.

**Best Quality of Life (Despite Costs):** California—if you need the best VA healthcare or are earning big civilian dollars. Otherwise, avoid.

**Most Balanced:** South Carolina—decent exemptions, affordable living, excellent VA care in Charleston, strong military culture.

**Avoid Unless You Have Specific Reasons:** Mississippi—cheapest in the nation, but VA access and quality-of-life metrics are the worst.

## Closing Thoughts: All 50 States Reviewed

We've now covered all 50 states across five regional guides:

1. **Top 10 Veteran-Friendly States** – Florida, Texas, Virginia, Nevada, Alaska, Washington, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, South Dakota
2. **Northeast & Mid-Atlantic** – Pennsylvania (surprise winner), New Hampshire, Delaware, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey
3. **Midwest** – Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, North Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska
4. **Mountain West & Plains** – Oklahoma (surprise winner), Wyoming, Tennessee, Montana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, West Virginia
5. **Southern & Pacific** – Oregon, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, California (VA care paradox), Hawaii

**The universal truth:** There's no single "best" state for all veterans. Your ideal location depends on:

- **Health needs:** If you need cutting-edge VA care, focus on California, Virginia, Massachusetts, or major metro areas.
- **Financial priorities:** If taxes matter most, target the no-income-tax states (Florida, Texas, Nevada, Washington, Tennessee, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska).
- **Disability rating:** If you're 100% disabled, states with aggressive property tax exemptions (Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska) offer huge savings.
- **Lifestyle preferences:** Outdoor recreation? Mountain West. Beaches? Florida, California, Hawaii. Four seasons? Northeast, Midwest.
- **Job opportunities:** Transitioning to civilian work? Texas, Virginia, California, Colorado offer the best markets.

**Don't just chase tax savings.** A state with zero income tax doesn't help if you can't find work, can't access VA care, or hate the environment.

**Run your personal numbers.** Use our [interactive state comparison tool](https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com/state-benefits) to plug in your specific income, disability rating, housing budget, and healthcare needs. The "best" state for you might surprise you.

**You've earned the right to live somewhere that values your service and fits your life.** Choose wisely. Do the research. Visit before you commit. And make the move that's right for you—not just the one that looks best on paper.

**Fair winds and following seas. You've got this.**
