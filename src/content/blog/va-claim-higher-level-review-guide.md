# VA Higher-Level Review: When and How to Request a Senior Review

## Bottom Line Up Front

A **Higher-Level Review (HLR)** is an appeal option where a senior VA reviewer re-examines your claim using the existing evidence. It's best when the VA made a **clear error**—misapplied regulations, overlooked evidence, or made factual mistakes. You **cannot submit new evidence** with an HLR, but the reviewer can identify errors and order a new C&P exam if needed. File within **1 year** of your decision to preserve your effective date. HLR decisions typically take **4-5 months**.

## What Is Higher-Level Review?

Higher-Level Review is one of three options in the VA's Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system. It allows a more experienced VA reviewer to look at your claim again with fresh eyes.

**Key characteristics:**
- Same evidence—no new evidence can be submitted
- Different reviewer—senior adjudicator, not the original rater
- Focuses on errors—legal, factual, or procedural mistakes
- Can order new exam—if original C&P exam was inadequate
- Informal conference option—you can talk to the reviewer

## When to Use Higher-Level Review

### HLR Is GOOD For:

**1. Clear factual errors**
- VA stated wrong dates
- VA misidentified your condition
- VA stated facts that are incorrect

**2. Overlooked evidence**
- Examiner ignored a key document
- Medical records weren't considered
- Important evidence wasn't mentioned in decision

**3. Misapplied regulations**
- Wrong rating criteria used
- Regulation interpreted incorrectly
- Legal standard applied improperly

**4. Inadequate C&P exam**
- Exam was too short
- Examiner didn't perform required tests
- Exam didn't address your claimed condition
- Examiner made errors in the report

**5. Mathematical errors**
- Combined rating calculated wrong
- Effective date computed incorrectly
- Backpay amount miscalculated

**6. You believe decision doesn't match evidence**
- The evidence supports service connection
- Rating should be higher based on the evidence
- Everything in your file supports your claim

### HLR Is NOT Good For:

**1. You have new evidence**
- If you have a new nexus letter, medical record, or buddy statement → Use Supplemental Claim instead

**2. You need a medical opinion**
- If the denial is due to lack of nexus and you don't have one → Get nexus letter and file Supplemental Claim

**3. Original evidence was weak**
- If your evidence was genuinely insufficient → Gather more evidence and file Supplemental Claim

**4. You want to argue legal points extensively**
- For complex legal disputes → Board of Veterans' Appeals may be better

## How to File Higher-Level Review

### Step 1: Review Your Decision

Before filing, understand:
- What was decided
- Why it was decided that way
- What error you believe occurred

### Step 2: Complete VA Form 20-0996

**Information needed:**
- Your personal information
- Conditions you're appealing
- Whether you want an informal conference

**Request an informal conference:** Check YES. This gives you a chance to speak directly with the reviewer.

### Step 3: Submit the Form

**Online:** VA.gov (recommended for tracking)
**Mail:** Mail to address on form
**In Person:** Local VA Regional Office
**Fax:** Number on form

### Step 4: Wait for Contact (If Requesting Conference)

If you requested an informal conference, the reviewer will contact you to schedule a phone call.

### Step 5: Attend Informal Conference

Discuss your case with the reviewer. This is your opportunity to:
- Point out specific errors
- Explain why the decision was wrong
- Ensure the reviewer understands your position

### Step 6: Wait for Decision

Typical timeline: 4-5 months (faster than Board appeals, similar to Supplemental Claims)

## The Informal Conference

### What It Is

A phone call with the senior reviewer where you can discuss your case. No testimony, no formal hearing—just a conversation.

### Why You Should Request One

- **Direct communication** with the decision-maker
- **Opportunity to explain** what went wrong
- **Point out specific errors** they might miss
- **Ensure nothing is overlooked**
- **Ask questions** about the review

### How to Prepare

1. **Review your claims file** (request a copy if you don't have one)
2. **Identify specific errors** in the original decision
3. **Prepare talking points** for each error
4. **Know your evidence** and where to find it in your file
5. **Be concise** and focused

### During the Conference

**Do:**
- Be respectful and professional
- Focus on specific errors
- Reference specific evidence by name/date
- Explain why the decision was wrong
- Ask if they have questions

**Don't:**
- Ramble or go off-topic
- Get emotional or angry
- Introduce new evidence (not allowed)
- Argue legal theory extensively
- Be unprepared

### Sample Talking Points

**For overlooked evidence:**
"The decision didn't mention my buddy statement from John Smith dated March 15, 2023, which documents the in-service incident. This evidence supports service connection and should have been considered."

**For inadequate C&P exam:**
"My C&P exam lasted only 10 minutes and the examiner didn't test my range of motion with repetitive use. The DBQ requires this testing under DeLuca factors. I request a new, adequate examination."

**For misapplied regulation:**
"The decision applied the rating criteria for DC 5237 (lumbosacral strain) but my condition is degenerative disc disease, which should be rated under DC 5242. This affects my rating."

## Possible HLR Outcomes

### 1. Grant (Win)

The reviewer finds in your favor. You receive:
- Service connection (if initially denied)
- Higher rating (if rating was the issue)
- Corrected effective date
- Backpay if applicable

### 2. Denial (Loss)

The reviewer agrees with the original decision. Your options:
- File Supplemental Claim with new evidence
- File Board appeal
- Accept the decision

### 3. Return for Correction

The reviewer identifies an error that needs to be fixed, such as:
- Rating needs recalculation
- Condition needs re-evaluation
- New C&P exam needed

The claim goes back to the regional office for correction.

### 4. Partial Grant

Some issues are decided in your favor, others are not. You can appeal the unfavorable portions.

## When HLR Can Order a New C&P Exam

The HLR reviewer can find that the original C&P exam was inadequate and order a new one. This happens when:

- Exam didn't address the claimed condition
- Required testing wasn't performed
- Examiner didn't answer required questions
- Exam was clearly insufficient

**This is a key benefit of HLR.** If your C&P exam was bad, HLR can fix it without you needing new evidence.

## HLR vs. Supplemental Claim: Which to Choose?

| Factor | Higher-Level Review | Supplemental Claim |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| New evidence | No | Yes (required) |
| Best for | Errors in decision | Weak original evidence |
| Can get new C&P | Yes, if original inadequate | Yes |
| Informal conference | Yes | No |
| Timeline | 4-5 months | 4-6 months |
| Success rate | ~25% | ~35% |

**Rule of thumb:**
- If you have new evidence (or can get it) → Supplemental Claim
- If VA made a clear error → Higher-Level Review
- If C&P exam was inadequate → Either can work; HLR if no new evidence

## Common HLR Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Filing HLR When You Need Evidence

If your claim was denied due to lack of nexus and you don't have a nexus letter in your file, HLR won't help. You need to submit new evidence via Supplemental Claim.

### Mistake 2: Not Requesting Informal Conference

The informal conference is your chance to make your case directly. Always request it.

### Mistake 3: Missing the Deadline

You must file within 1 year of your decision date to preserve your effective date. Track this deadline carefully.

### Mistake 4: Being Unprepared for Conference

Don't waste the conference rambling. Know your file, know the errors, and be specific.

### Mistake 5: Getting Emotional

The reviewer isn't your enemy. Anger doesn't help your case. Be professional and focused.

## What Happens After HLR

### If You Win

- You receive a new Rating Decision
- If applicable, backpay is calculated
- Payment arrives within 30-45 days

### If You Lose

**Options:**
1. **Supplemental Claim:** Gather new evidence (especially nexus letter) and try again
2. **Board Appeal:** Take your case to a Veterans Law Judge
3. **Accept:** Move on if you've exhausted options

**Important:** Losing HLR doesn't mean you can't win on appeal. Many veterans win on Supplemental Claim after HLR denial.

## HLR Timeline Example

- **Day 1:** Receive unfavorable Rating Decision
- **Days 1-14:** Review decision, identify errors
- **Day 15:** File VA Form 20-0996, request informal conference
- **Day 30:** Receive confirmation of HLR receipt
- **Day 60:** Scheduled for informal conference
- **Day 65:** Attend informal conference
- **Day 150:** HLR decision issued
- **If granted:** Backpay within 30-45 days

## Key Takeaways

1. **HLR is for errors** - Use when VA made a mistake
2. **No new evidence** - If you need to add evidence, use Supplemental Claim
3. **Request informal conference** - Always
4. **File within 1 year** - To preserve effective date
5. **Be specific** - Know exactly what error occurred
6. **Can order new C&P** - If original was inadequate

Higher-Level Review is a powerful tool when used correctly. If the VA made a mistake on your claim, HLR can fix it—without you needing to gather new evidence.
