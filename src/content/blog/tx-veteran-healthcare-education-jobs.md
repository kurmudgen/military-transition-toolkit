# Texas Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Texas operates **eight VA medical centers** (Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Amarillo, Temple, Waco, Big Spring) plus 40+ community-based outpatient clinics and 20 Vet Centers, providing comprehensive coverage for the nation's largest veteran population (1.54+ million). About 90% of Texas veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care. Quality varies—Dallas and Houston VAMCs rate 3-4 stars, while smaller facilities rate 2-3 stars.

For education, Texas offers the **Hazlewood Act**—150 credit hours of FREE tuition at any public university or community college (worth $50,000+ at UT Austin or Texas A&M). This is one of the best state veteran education benefits nationally and is fully transferable to children/spouses through the Legacy Program. Every public university participates in Yellow Ribbon, and Texas has 50+ community colleges fully GI Bill-approved.

Employment is excellent—Texas veteran unemployment is **3.0%** (2024), matching the national average but with significantly more job opportunities. The state has 15+ major military installations (Fort Cavazos, Fort Bliss, Joint Base San Antonio, Dyess AFB, etc.) providing transition pathways, and major employers (defense contractors, tech companies, energy sector) actively recruit veterans. Austin ranks **#1 nationally** for veteran job opportunities.

Overall rating: **8/10** for healthcare (extensive facilities but quality varies by location), **9.5/10** for education (Hazlewood Act is elite—free tuition stacks with GI Bill), **8.5/10** for employment (strong job market, but competitive in major cities).

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- 90% of Texas veterans live within 60 minutes of VA primary care
- 75% within 60 minutes of VA specialty care
- 100% have access via telehealth or Community Care

**Urban Access:**
- Dallas-Fort Worth: Excellent—VAMC + 6 CBOCs within metro

- San Antonio: Excellent—VAMC + multiple CBOCs
- Austin: Good—CBOC in Round Rock, Temple VAMC 60 min away
- El Paso: Good—Multiple clinics, but limited specialty care

**Rural Access:**
- Moderate—CBOCs in most mid-sized cities
- Panhandle/West Texas: Limited—long drives to Amarillo or Lubbock
- Rio Grande Valley: Moderate—Harlingen system serves, but complex care requires San Antonio (4+ hour drive)

**Quality Ratings:**
- Houston VAMC: Above average (4 stars)
- Dallas, San Antonio, Temple: Average (3 stars)
- Smaller facilities: Below average (2-3 stars)
- Patient satisfaction improved 2022-2024 with staffing increases and facility upgrades

## Education Benefits

### Hazlewood Act: Texas's Premier Veteran Benefit

The **Hazlewood Act** (Texas Education Code Chapter 54, Subchapter C) provides **up to 150 credit hours of FREE tuition and most fees** at any Texas public university or community college. This is one of the best state veteran education benefits in America.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Entered military service in Texas OR designated Texas as home of record
- Served at least 181 days of active duty
- Received honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions
- Not in default on student loans made or guaranteed by Texas

**What's Covered:**
- Tuition for up to 150 credit hours (enough for bachelor's + significant master's coursework)
- Most mandatory fees
- **Does NOT cover:** Books, living expenses, supply fees, student services fees (varies by school)

**Value:**
- At **University of Texas Austin:** $1,300/credit hour x 150 = **$195,000 total value**
- At **Texas A&M:** $1,200/credit hour x 150 = **$180,000 total value**
- At **Texas State University:** $900/credit hour x 150 = **$135,000 total value**
- At **Houston Community College:** $250/credit hour x 60 (associate degree) = **$15,000 total value**

**Stacking with GI Bill:**

You can use Hazlewood concurrently with Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) if you're eligible for less than 100% GI Bill benefits. Hazlewood covers tuition gaps not paid by GI Bill.

- **If you have 100% GI Bill:** GI Bill pays tuition + you receive BAH ($2,100-$3,300/month in Texas) + book stipend ($1,000/year). Save Hazlewood for graduate school or transfer to children.
- **If you have 60% GI Bill:** GI Bill pays 60% of tuition, Hazlewood covers the remaining 40%, you still receive BAH at 60% rate.

**Strategic Use:** Many veterans use 100% GI Bill for undergraduate (getting full BAH), then use saved Hazlewood for graduate school or professional programs (law, medical, MBA).

**Hazlewood Legacy Program (Transferability):**

Veterans can transfer unused Hazlewood hours to:
- Biological children
- Stepchildren
- Adopted children
- Spouse

**Child Eligibility Requirements:**

- Veteran must not have been assigned academic credit from Hazlewood
- Must be Texas resident for tuition purposes

**Important:** Legacy Program was restricted in 2011. Veterans with service **after May 1, 2011** can only transfer if they are at least 10% disabled OR died in line of duty. Veterans who served **before May 1, 2011** have broader transfer rights.

**Application Process:**
1. Obtain VA Form 22-1999 or TX Vet Form 1009
2. Gather DD-214 showing Texas entry or home of record
3. Submit application to school's veteran certifying official
