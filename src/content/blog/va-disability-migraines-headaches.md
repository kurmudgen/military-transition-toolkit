## Understanding Migraine VA Ratings

Migraines are rated under 38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. Ratings are based solely on the frequency of "prostrating attacks" - severe headaches that incapacitate you and require bed rest.

### Rating Criteria Breakdown

#### 0% Rating
**Criteria:** Less than one prostrating attack in the last 3 months.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Diagnosed with migraines
- Infrequent severe attacks (less than 1 every 3 months)
- May have mild headaches more frequently, but not prostrating
- Headaches controlled well with medication

**Note:** Many veterans start at 0% if documentation doesn't show frequency of prostrating attacks.

#### 10% Rating
**Criteria:** With prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Approximately 6 prostrating attacks per year
- One severe, incapacitating headache every 2 months (on average)
- Headaches require lying down in dark room
- Cannot function during attack
- May last hours to days

**Monthly Payment:** $171.23

#### 30% Rating
**Criteria:** With prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Approximately 12 prostrating attacks per year
- One severe, incapacitating headache per month (on average)
- Attacks require bed rest
- May miss work due to headaches
- Significant functional impairment during attacks
- Some attacks may last multiple days

**Monthly Payment:** $524.31

**Most Common Rating** for veterans with well-documented migraines.

#### 50% Rating
**Criteria:** With very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

**What This Looks Like:**
- Very frequent incapacitating headaches
- Multiple prostrating attacks per month
- Prolonged duration (lasting days)
- Severe impact on ability to work
- Economic inadaptability (cannot maintain employment)
- Significant functional impairment
- Frequent work absences or job loss

**Monthly Payment:** $1,075.16

**Note:** 50% requires demonstrating "severe economic inadaptability" - essentially that migraines significantly impair your ability to work and earn a living.

## What Is a "Prostrating" Attack?

This is the key to migraine ratings. A prostrating attack means:

**Must Include:**
- **Incapacitating:** Cannot function, must stop all activities
- **Requires bed rest:** Need to lie down in dark, quiet room
- **Significant duration:** Lasts hours or more
- **Complete functional impairment:** Cannot work, drive, care for family during attack

**Prostrating Migraine Symptoms:**
- Severe throbbing head pain (often one-sided)
- Nausea and/or vomiting
- Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
- Sensitivity to sound (phonophobia)
- Must lie down and cannot function
- May have visual disturbances (aura)
- Pain so severe, normal activities impossible

**NOT Prostrating:**
- Mild headaches you can "work through"
- Tension headaches
- Headaches relieved quickly by over-the-counter medication
- Headaches that don't require you to stop activities and lie down

---

## Evidence Requirements

### 1. Medical Diagnosis

**Required:**
- Formal diagnosis of migraine headaches from medical provider
- Diagnosis in medical records
- Can be diagnosed by primary care, neurologist, or headache specialist

**Migraine Diagnostic Criteria:**
Typically diagnosed based on:
- Recurrent headaches lasting 4-72 hours
- At least two of: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate-severe intensity, aggravated by routine activity
- During headache: nausea/vomiting and/or photophobia/phonophobia
- Not attributed to another disorder

### 2. Frequency Documentation - CRITICAL

**You must document the frequency of prostrating attacks.** This determines your rating.

**How to Document Frequency:**

**A. Headache Diary (Most Important):**
Keep a detailed log for at least 3-6 months:
- Date of each migraine
- Duration (start and end time)
- Severity (1-10 scale)
- Whether prostrating (required bed rest)
- Symptoms (nausea, vomiting, light/sound sensitivity, aura)
- Medications taken and effectiveness
- Activities missed (work, family events, etc.)
- Functional impact

**B. Medical Records:**
- Provider notes documenting headache frequency
- Medication refill frequency (frequent refills = frequent headaches)
- ER visits for migraines
- Calls to clinic for severe headaches
- Hospitalization for intractable migraines

**C. Employment Records:**
- Sick days due to migraines
- FMLA documentation
- Supervisor notes about absences
- Termination related to absences

**D. Lay Statements:**
- Family/friends witness your prostrating attacks
- Statements describing how often you're incapacitated by headaches
- Examples of events missed due to migraines

**Example Headache Diary Entry:**
```
Date: 1/15/2025
Time: 2:00 PM - 11:00 PM (9 hours)
Severity: 9/10
Prostrating: YES - had to leave work early, lie down in dark room
Symptoms: Right-sided throbbing pain, nausea, vomited twice, extreme light sensitivity, couldn't tolerate any noise
Medications: Sumatriptan 100mg (minimal relief), Zofran for nausea
Activities Missed: Left work at 2 PM, missed daughter's basketball game, couldn't make dinner
```

### 3. Treatment Records

**Document:**
- Medications prescribed (abortive and preventive)
  - **Abortive:** Triptans, NSAIDs, antiemetics
  - **Preventive:** Beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, CGRP inhibitors
- Medication trials and effectiveness
- Side effects from medications
- Specialist referrals (neurology, headache clinic)
- Alternative treatments (Botox injections, nerve blocks, acupuncture)
- Imaging (MRI, CT) - usually normal but rules out other causes

**Show Treatment Failure:**
- Multiple medication trials
- Inadequate relief despite treatment
- Side effects preventing medication use
- Continued high frequency despite preventive treatment

### 4. Service Connection Proof

**Direct Service Connection:**
- Migraines began during service or within one year of separation
- Service medical records documenting headaches
- Continuity of treatment from service to present
- Nexus linking current migraines to service

**Secondary Service Connection (Very Common):**
Migraines secondary to another service-connected condition:

**Common Primary Conditions:**
- **PTSD:** Stress, hyperarousal, sleep disruption trigger migraines
- **TBI:** Post-traumatic headaches are extremely common
- **Neck conditions (cervical spine):** Neck injuries cause migraines
- **TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder):** Jaw tension triggers migraines
- **Tinnitus:** Constant noise causes stress headaches/migraines
- **Sleep apnea:** Poor sleep quality triggers migraines
- **Hypertension:** Blood pressure fluctuations trigger migraines
- **Vision problems:** Eye strain causes migraines

**Gulf War Presumptive:**
- Chronic headaches are a presumptive condition for Gulf War veterans
- Service in Southwest Asia during Gulf War era
- Unexplained headaches = presumptive service connection

### 5. Nexus Opinion

Medical opinion linking migraines to service or service-connected condition.

**Strong Nexus Includes:**
- Provider review of records
- Medical explanation of connection
- Temporal relationship (when headaches began)
- "At least as likely as not" statement

**Example Nexus (Secondary to PTSD):**
"It is at least as likely as not that the veteran's migraine headaches are secondary to service-connected PTSD. Medical literature demonstrates that PTSD significantly increases migraine risk through chronic stress, hyperarousal, and sleep disruption. The temporal relationship supports this, as the veteran's migraines increased in frequency after PTSD onset."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Documenting Frequency
**Problem:** Saying "I get bad headaches a lot" without specifics.
**Solution:** Keep detailed headache diary for 3-6 months showing dates and whether prostrating.

### 2. Not Emphasizing "Prostrating" Nature
**Problem:** Describing headaches as "severe" but not making clear you must lie down and cannot function.
**Solution:** Use the word "prostrating" and describe that you must stop all activities and lie in dark room.

### 3. Not Tracking Headaches Before Filing
**Problem:** Filing claim without documentation of frequency over several months.
**Solution:** Document headaches for at least 3-6 months before filing to establish pattern.

### 4. Missing Secondary Connection Opportunities
**Problem:** Filing direct service connection when secondary is easier to prove.
**Solution:** Identify service-connected condition that causes migraines (PTSD, TBI, neck injury, etc.).

### 5. Inadequate Lay Evidence
**Problem:** No statements from people who witness your prostrating attacks.
**Solution:** Get statements from spouse, family, coworkers who have seen you incapacitated by headaches.

### 6. Not Documenting Economic Impact
**Problem:** For 50% rating, not showing headaches affect ability to work.
**Solution:** Document work absences, job loss, inability to maintain employment due to headaches.

## C&P Examination Preparation

### Before the Exam

**1. Bring Headache Diary:**
- At least 3-6 months of documented headaches
- Clearly mark prostrating attacks
- Show frequency pattern

**2. Bring Medical Records:**
- Neurology notes
- ER visit records for severe headaches
- Medication list and refill records
- Imaging reports (MRI, CT)

**3. Prepare to Describe:**
- Typical migraine attack from start to finish
- What you must do during attack (lie down in dark room)
- How long attacks last
- Frequency (average per month/year)
- Triggers
- Medications and effectiveness
- What you miss due to migraines (work, activities)

**4. Bring Supporting Documents:**
- Employment records showing absences
- Lay statements from family
- Calendar marking headache days
- Photos of medications/empty medication bottles showing frequent use

### During the Exam

**DO:**
- Clearly state frequency of prostrating attacks
- Use the word "prostrating" - emphasize that you must lie down and cannot function
- Give specific examples of recent attacks

- Discuss connection to service or service-connected condition

**DON'T:**
- Minimize frequency or severity
- Describe only mild headaches you can work through
- Exaggerate (hurts credibility)
- Forget to bring headache diary
- Fail to emphasize prostrating nature

**Key Points to Emphasize:**

1. **Frequency:** "I have prostrating migraines approximately once per month [or whatever your frequency is]."

2. **Prostrating Nature:** "During these attacks, I must stop everything I'm doing and lie down in a dark, quiet room. I cannot function at all. I can't work, drive, take care of my family, or do anything."

3. **Duration:** "These attacks typically last [X hours/days] before I can function again."

4. **Functional Impact:** "I've missed [X days] of work in the past year due to migraines. I've had to leave work early multiple times. I've missed [family events, activities] because of migraines."

5. **Treatment:** "I've tried [list medications]. They help somewhat but don't prevent the prostrating attacks."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I prove my headaches are "prostrating"?
Describe in detail that you must stop all activities and lie down in a dark, quiet room. Cannot work, drive, or function. Use the specific word "prostrating" in your statement. Lay statements from people who've witnessed your attacks are very helpful.

### How long do I need to track headaches before filing?
Ideally 3-6 months to establish a clear pattern of frequency. The VA will look at your average frequency "over the last several months."

### Can I get 30% if I have more than one prostrating headache per month?
The 30% criteria is "on average once a month." If you have 12+ prostrating attacks per year, you meet 30%. If you have significantly more (multiple per month) and it affects your ability to work, you may qualify for 50%.

### What's the difference between 30% and 50%?
50% requires "very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability." This means very high frequency (multiple per month), long duration (days), and significant work impact (cannot maintain employment).

### Do mild headaches count toward my rating?
No. Only prostrating attacks (incapacitating, requiring bed rest) count for rating purposes. You may have many mild headaches, but the rating is based solely on prostrating attacks.

### Can I get a separate rating for headaches if I already have PTSD?
Yes. Migraines can be rated separately from PTSD if they're a distinct condition, typically as secondary to PTSD.

### Do I need to see a neurologist?
Not required, but helpful. A neurologist's diagnosis and nexus opinion carries weight. However, primary care physicians can also diagnose migraines and provide nexus opinions.

### What if my headaches are from a neck injury?
This is a common secondary connection. Cervicogenic (neck-origin) headaches can be rated as migraines if they meet migraine criteria and are prostrating. File as secondary to your service-connected neck condition.

### Can medications affect my rating?
Your rating is based on your current condition with treatment. Even if medications help somewhat, if you still have prostrating attacks at a certain frequency, you're rated accordingly. Don't stop medications to try to get a higher rating.

### How often should I refill my headache medications?
This is documentation of frequency. If you're refilling triptan prescriptions monthly, it suggests you're using them frequently for migraines. Keep medication bottles/labels as evidence.

### What if I go to the ER for severe headaches?
ER visits for migraines are strong evidence of severity and can help document frequency. Keep all ER records.

### Can I get more than 50% for migraines?
No. 50% is the maximum rating for migraines under current VA regulations (DC 8100).

### What if I have medication-overuse headaches from taking too much medication?
This is common in chronic migraine sufferers. It should be documented and shows the severity of your condition. May need medication holiday and transition to preventive treatment.

### Do I qualify for TDIU with a 50% migraine rating?
Potentially. TDIU requires one condition at 60% or combined 70% with one at 40%. If migraines are rated 50% and you have other conditions totaling 20%+, you may qualify. Document that migraines prevent substantially gainful employment.

## Final Thoughts

Migraine headaches can be severely debilitating and significantly impact quality of life and ability to work. If your migraines are connected to your military service or a service-connected condition, you deserve compensation.

**Keys to a Successful Migraine Claim:**

1. **Document frequency meticulously** - Keep detailed headache diary for months
2. **Emphasize prostrating nature** - Make it clear you're incapacitated during attacks
3. **Show treatment attempts** - Multiple medications tried
4. **Identify service connection** - Direct or (more commonly) secondary to another condition
5. **Get strong nexus** - Medical opinion explaining the connection
6. **Gather corroborating evidence** - Lay statements, employment records
7. **Be patient and persistent** - Migraines claims can be won, even on appeal

**Remember:** The key to your rating is the frequency of prostrating attacks. "Prostrating" means incapacitating attacks requiring bed rest where you cannot function. Document these carefully.

Migraines are a legitimate, often debilitating medical condition. Don't minimize your symptoms. You earned these benefits through your service.
