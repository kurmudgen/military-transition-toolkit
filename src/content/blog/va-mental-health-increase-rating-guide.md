# How to Increase Your VA Mental Health Rating: Complete Strategy Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

VA mental health ratings (0%-100%) are based on **occupational and social impairment**, not just symptoms. To increase your rating, you must document how your condition affects your ability to **work and maintain relationships**. The key: understand what each rating level requires and provide evidence showing you meet the higher criteria. This guide explains exactly what VA looks for and how to document it.

## How Mental Health Ratings Work

### The General Rating Formula

All mental health conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc.) are rated under the same criteria:

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0% | Diagnosed but symptoms controlled by medication |
| 10% | Mild symptoms with decreased work efficiency during stress |
| 30% | Occasional decrease in work efficiency, intermittent inability to perform |
| 50% | Reduced reliability and productivity |
| 70% | Deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood) |
| 100% | Total occupational and social impairment |

### What Determines the Rating

**It's NOT just about symptoms.** It's about **functional impairment**.

Two veterans with identical symptoms can have different ratings if one functions better than the other.

**The question:** How much does your mental health condition impair your ability to:
- Work/maintain employment
- Maintain relationships
- Handle daily activities
- Think clearly and make decisions
- Control emotions and behavior

## What Each Rating Level Requires

### 0% Rating

**Criteria:**
- Formal diagnosis exists
- Symptoms are controlled by continuous medication
- No occupational or social impairment

**Rarely assigned** - Most people with diagnosed conditions have some impairment.

### 10% Rating

**Criteria:**
- Occupational/social impairment due to mild symptoms
- Decreased work efficiency and ability only during periods of significant stress

**Examples:**
- Symptoms manageable most of the time
- Problems mainly during stressful situations
- Generally functions well

### 30% Rating

**Criteria:**
- Occupational/social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency
- Intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks

**Key symptoms at this level:**

- Chronic sleep impairment
- Mild memory loss

**Examples:**

### 100% Rating

**Criteria:**
- Total occupational and social impairment

**Key symptoms:**

- Disorientation to time or place

**Examples:**

- Cannot maintain any relationships
- Requires constant supervision
- Cannot take care of basic needs

## How to Increase Your Rating

### Step 1: Understand Your Current Rating

Get your rating decision letter. What rating do you have? What criteria were cited?

### Step 2: Identify the Next Level

What symptoms and impairment would demonstrate the next rating level?

**Example:** Currently 50% → Need to show deficiencies in most areas (70%)

### Step 3: Document Your Impairment

**Medical records:**
- Continue mental health treatment
- Report all symptoms to your provider
- Ensure severity is documented
- Request records showing progression

**Personal documentation:**
- Keep a symptom journal
- Document panic attacks, flashbacks, etc.
- Note days missed from work
- Track relationship issues
- Document self-care difficulties

**Employment impact:**
- Performance reviews showing decline
- Disciplinary actions
- Job losses
- Accommodations requested/needed

**Statements:**
- Personal statement detailing impairment
- Buddy statements from family/friends
- Spouse statement about relationship impact

### Step 4: File for Increase

**VA Form 21-526EZ:**
- File for "Increase" on your mental health condition
- Attach supporting evidence
- Include personal statement

### Step 5: C&P Exam

The C&P exam is critical. Prepare to:
- Describe symptoms in detail
- Explain how symptoms affect functioning
- Describe worst days
- Don't minimize

## What to Tell the C&P Examiner

### Describe Functional Impact

Don't just list symptoms. Explain how they affect your life:

**Instead of:** "I have nightmares."
**Say:** "I have nightmares 4-5 nights per week. I wake up in a panic, drenched in sweat. It takes me 1-2 hours to calm down. I average 3-4 hours of sleep per night. The next day I can barely function at work."

### Cover All Areas

Address how your condition affects:
- **Work:** Absences, performance issues, conflicts, job losses
- **Family:** Relationship with spouse, children, parents
- **Social:** Friendships, isolation, public situations
- **Daily activities:** Self-care, household tasks, driving
- **Judgment:** Decision-making, impulsive behavior
- **Thinking:** Concentration, memory, clarity
- **Mood:** Depression, anxiety, anger, emotional control

### Describe Your Worst Days

The VA doesn't rate you on your best days:

"On bad days, which happen about 3 times per week, I can't get out of bed. I cancel plans. I've called in sick to work. I don't shower or eat properly. My wife has to check on me because I won't respond to texts."

### Don't Minimize

Veterans often downplay symptoms. Don't.

**Instead of:** "I guess I have some anxiety sometimes."
**Say:** "I have significant anxiety that affects me daily. I can't go to crowded places. I've had panic attacks at work. I avoid driving because of anxiety. I've lost friends because I cancel plans when anxiety is bad."

### Be Honest

Don't exaggerate, but don't minimize. Describe your actual experience accurately.

## Supporting Evidence for Increase Claims

### Medical Evidence

- **Treatment records** showing symptoms and severity
- **Medication history** (especially changes/increases)
- **Hospitalization records** (psychiatric)
- **Therapist notes** documenting symptoms

### Employment Evidence

- Performance reviews showing decline
- Disciplinary records
- Termination letters (if applicable)
- Employer statement (if willing)
- Records of accommodations

### Personal Statements

**Your statement should cover:**
- Symptom progression since last rating
- Current symptoms and frequency
- Impact on work
- Impact on relationships
- Impact on daily activities
- Worst-day description
- Why current rating is inadequate

### Buddy Statements

Have family/friends describe:
- Symptoms they've witnessed
- Changes they've observed
- Impact on your life/relationship
- Specific examples

## Common Reasons for Denial

### "Symptoms Don't Meet Higher Level"

**Solution:** Document more thoroughly. Show frequency, severity, and functional impact.

### "You're Still Working"

**Response:** Working doesn't mean no impairment. Document:
- Accommodations required
- Performance issues
- Absences
- How much harder it is for you

### "No Treatment Records Supporting Increase"

**Solution:** Get consistent treatment and ensure all symptoms are documented.

### "Examiner Opined Current Rating Is Accurate"

**Solution:** File Supplemental Claim with:
- Private mental health evaluation
- Additional buddy statements
- More documentation

## Appeal Strategies

### Higher-Level Review

If you believe evidence supports a higher rating, request HLR. Point out:
- Evidence examiner overlooked
- Criteria met but not acknowledged

### Supplemental Claim

Submit with new evidence:
- Private psychological evaluation
- Updated treatment records
- Additional statements

### Private Evaluation

Consider a private mental health evaluation from a psychologist or psychiatrist who:
- Reviews your records
- Examines you thoroughly
- Provides opinion on appropriate rating
- Uses VA criteria in their opinion

## Tips for Success

### Consistent Treatment

Regular treatment creates a record. If you're not in treatment, start. Document everything with your provider.

### Be Honest with Providers

Tell your mental health providers about ALL symptoms. They can't document what you don't report.

### Keep a Symptom Journal

Track:
- Panic attacks (date, duration, trigger)
- Nightmares (frequency, intensity)
- Depressed/anxious episodes
- Days missed from work
- Relationship conflicts
- Isolation incidents

### Gather Witness Statements

Family and friends see things you might minimize. Their perspective matters.

### Don't Give Up

Many increases require multiple attempts. Learn from each decision and come back stronger.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ratings are based on functional impairment**, not just symptoms
2. **Document how condition affects work and relationships**
3. **Describe your worst days** at C&P exam
4. **Don't minimize** - Be accurate but complete
5. **Get buddy statements** from people who witness your symptoms
6. **Consistent treatment** creates evidence
7. **Appeal if denied** - Many increases succeed on appeal

Your rating should reflect your actual impairment. If your mental health condition is getting worse or wasn't rated accurately, you deserve to have that recognized.
