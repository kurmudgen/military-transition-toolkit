# VA Disability Rating for Peripheral Neuropathy: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Peripheral neuropathy is rated under **Diagnostic Codes 8510-8730** (peripheral nerves) with ratings from **10% to 80%** per extremity depending on the nerve affected and severity. **Each limb is rated separately**, so bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathy can result in significant combined ratings. Peripheral neuropathy is commonly secondary to **diabetes** and is also **presumptive for Agent Orange exposure** (early-onset peripheral neuropathy). The key evidence is **EMG/nerve conduction studies** showing nerve damage. Claims typically take 4-8 months.

## What Is Peripheral Neuropathy?

Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the peripheral nerves, causing weakness, numbness, and pain, usually in the hands and feet.

**Symptoms:**
- Numbness and tingling (usually starts in feet)
- Burning or shooting pain
- Muscle weakness
- Loss of balance/coordination
- Sensitivity to touch
- Foot drop (severe cases)

**Military connections:**

### Direct Service Connection
- Toxic exposure during service
- Injuries affecting nerves
- Cold injury residuals

### Agent Orange Presumptive
Early-onset peripheral neuropathy is presumptive for veterans exposed to Agent Orange if:
- Manifested within one year of exposure
- At least 10% disabling
- Served in qualifying location (Vietnam, Korean DMZ, Thailand bases, etc.)

### Secondary Service Connection
- **Diabetes** (most common cause - diabetic neuropathy)
- Kidney disease (uremic neuropathy)
- Alcohol use disorder
- Medications for service-connected conditions

## VA Rating Criteria

Peripheral neuropathy is rated based on which nerve is affected and severity of paralysis:

### Upper Extremities - Common Nerves

**Median Nerve (DC 8515):**

| Severity | Major (Dominant) | Minor |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Mild | 10% | 10% |
| Moderate | 30% | 20% |
| Severe | 50% | 40% |
| Complete paralysis | 70% | 60% |

**Ulnar Nerve (DC 8516):**

| Severity | Major (Dominant) | Minor |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Mild | 10% | 10% |
| Moderate | 30% | 20% |
| Severe | 40% | 30% |
| Complete paralysis | 60% | 50% |

**Radial Nerve (DC 8514):**

| Severity | Major (Dominant) | Minor |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Mild | 20% | 20% |
| Moderate | 30% | 20% |
| Severe | 50% | 40% |
| Complete paralysis | 70% | 60% |

### Lower Extremities - Common Nerves

**Sciatic Nerve (DC 8520):**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | 10% |
| Moderate | 20% |
| Moderately severe | 40% |
| Severe (with marked muscular atrophy) | 60% |
| Complete paralysis | 80% |

**External Popliteal (Peroneal) Nerve (DC 8521):**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | 10% |
| Moderate | 20% |
| Severe | 30% |
| Complete paralysis | 40% |

**Internal Popliteal (Tibial) Nerve (DC 8524):**

| Severity | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | 10% |
| Moderate | 10% |
| Severe | 20% |
| Complete paralysis | 30% |

### Understanding Severity

**Mild:**
- Intermittent symptoms
- Numbness/tingling
- Minimal functional impairment

**Moderate:**
- Constant symptoms
- Noticeable weakness
- Affects daily activities

**Severe:**
- Significant weakness or atrophy
- Major functional impairment
- May include foot drop

**Complete Paralysis:**
- Total loss of nerve function
- Complete sensory and motor loss

## Each Limb Rated Separately

**Important:** Each affected extremity receives its own rating.

**Example - Diabetic Neuropathy:**
- Right lower extremity (sciatic) - Moderate: 20%
- Left lower extremity (sciatic) - Moderate: 20%
- Right upper extremity (ulnar) - Mild: 10%
- Left upper extremity (ulnar) - Mild: 10%

Combined rating using VA math would be significant.

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence

**For Agent Orange presumptive:**
- DD-214 showing qualifying service location
- Onset within one year of last exposure
- At least 10% disabling

**For secondary to diabetes:**
- Service-connected diabetes
- Diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy
- Nexus from doctor (usually straightforward)

**For direct service connection:**
- In-service nerve injury or toxic exposure
- Continuous symptoms since service
- Nexus opinion

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- **EMG/Nerve Conduction Study** (gold standard)
- Neurological evaluation
- Documentation of affected nerves
- Severity assessment

### Severity Evidence
- EMG results showing degree of damage
- Physical examination findings
- Functional limitations documented
- Treatment records

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review medical history
2. Perform neurological examination
3. Test sensation and strength
4. Identify affected nerves
5. Review or order EMG/NCS
6. Assess severity

**What to tell them:**
- All symptoms (numbness, tingling, pain, weakness)
- Which limbs are affected
- Impact on walking, balance, grip
- When symptoms started
- What makes symptoms worse
- Any falls from balance problems

**Document:**
- All affected areas
- Functional limitations
- Pain levels
- Balance problems

## Agent Orange and Presumptive Service Connection

### Early-Onset Peripheral Neuropathy

For veterans who served in:
- Vietnam (1962-1975)
- Korean DMZ (1968-1971)
- Thailand military bases
- C-123 aircraft
- Other qualifying locations

**Requirements:**
- Neuropathy manifested within **one year** of last herbicide exposure
- At least **10% disabling**
- Became manifest by December 31, 2026

**Note:** "Early-onset" refers to onset within one year of exposure, not the veteran's age.

### Filing Agent Orange Claim
1. File VA Form 21-526EZ
2. Include DD-214 showing qualifying service
3. Document when neuropathy symptoms began
4. Medical evidence of peripheral neuropathy

## Secondary Conditions

**Peripheral neuropathy can be secondary to:**
- Diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) - most common
- Kidney disease
- Alcohol use disorder
- Chemotherapy (for service-connected cancer)
- Medications
- Cold injuries

**Peripheral neuropathy can cause:**
- Falls/injuries (balance problems)
- Depression (chronic pain, disability)
- Limited mobility
- Foot ulcers (if diabetic)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is peripheral neuropathy presumptive for Vietnam veterans?
Early-onset peripheral neuropathy (manifesting within one year of exposure) is presumptive for Agent Orange exposure. Late-onset neuropathy is NOT presumptive but can still be claimed with a nexus opinion.

### Can I claim each limb separately?
Yes. Each affected extremity receives its own rating under the appropriate nerve diagnostic code.

### Do I need an EMG?
An EMG/nerve conduction study provides objective evidence of nerve damage and helps determine severity. While not absolutely required, it significantly strengthens your claim.

### What if my neuropathy is from diabetes?
Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common secondary claims. If you have service-connected diabetes and develop neuropathy, the connection is well-established medically.

### What's the difference between radiculopathy and peripheral neuropathy?
Radiculopathy is nerve damage at the spine (nerve root). Peripheral neuropathy is damage to nerves in the extremities. You can have both.

### Can I claim both radiculopathy and peripheral neuropathy?
Potentially, if they affect different nerves. However, the VA will not rate the same nerve damage twice (pyramiding). If you have diabetic neuropathy AND lumbar radiculopathy affecting the same leg, only one may be rated, or they may be evaluated together.
