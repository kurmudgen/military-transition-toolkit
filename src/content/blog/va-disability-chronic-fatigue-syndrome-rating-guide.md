# VA Disability Rating for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), is rated under **Diagnostic Code 6354** with ratings from **10% to 100%**. CFS is a **Gulf War presumptive condition** for veterans who served in Southwest Asia. The key criteria are **debilitating fatigue** that reduces activity levels, along with associated symptoms. This is one of the few conditions with its own specific rating criteria. Claims can be challenging because CFS is diagnosed by exclusion—meaning other conditions must be ruled out first. Claims typically take 6-12 months.

## What Is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?

CFS/ME is a complex disorder characterized by extreme fatigue that doesn't improve with rest and cannot be explained by an underlying medical condition.

**Diagnostic Criteria (CDC):**
- Severe fatigue for 6+ months
- Fatigue not explained by other medical conditions
- Significantly reduced activity level
- Post-exertional malaise (symptoms worsen after activity)
- Unrefreshing sleep

**Plus at least one of:**
- Cognitive impairment (brain fog)
- Orthostatic intolerance (symptoms worse when standing)

**Associated symptoms:**
- Muscle pain
- Joint pain (without swelling)
- Headaches
- Sore throat
- Tender lymph nodes
- Sleep disturbances
- Sensitivity to light, sound, chemicals

**Military connections:**

### Gulf War Presumptive
CFS is recognized as a Gulf War presumptive condition under 38 CFR § 3.317 for veterans who served in Southwest Asia and have:
- Chronic symptoms for 6+ months
- Symptoms manifested by December 31, 2026
- 10% or more disabling

### Direct Service Connection
- Onset during service
- Viral infection during service triggering CFS
- Physical/emotional stressors during service

### Secondary Service Connection
- Can develop secondary to other conditions
- Some overlap with fibromyalgia, PTSD

## VA Rating Criteria

CFS is rated under **38 CFR § 4.88b, Diagnostic Code 6354**:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Signs and symptoms of CFS that wax and wane but result in periods of incapacitation of at least one but less than two weeks total duration per year, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication |
| **20%** | Signs and symptoms of CFS that are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities by less than 25% of the pre-illness level, or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least two but less than four weeks total duration per year |
| **40%** | Signs and symptoms of CFS that are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to 50 to 75% of the pre-illness level, or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least four but less than six weeks total duration per year |
| **60%** | Signs and symptoms of CFS that are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50% of the pre-illness level, or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least six weeks total duration per year |
| **100%** | Signs and symptoms of CFS that are nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely and which may occasionally preclude self-care |

### Understanding Key Terms

**Incapacitating Episode**: Period of acute symptoms severe enough to require bed rest AND treatment by a physician.

**Pre-illness Level**: Your activity level before developing CFS. Compare current function to prior capability.

**Routine Daily Activities**: Work, household tasks, self-care, social activities.

### Required Symptoms for Rating

The rating criteria specify that CFS must include:
- Debilitating fatigue severe enough to reduce daily activity to less than 50% of pre-illness level for at least 6 months

AND at least 6 of the following:
1. Acute onset of condition
2. Low-grade fever
3. Non-exudative pharyngitis (sore throat)
4. Palpable or tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes
5. Generalized muscle aches or weakness
6. Fatigue lasting 24+ hours after exercise
7. Headaches (new type, pattern, or severity)
8. Migratory joint pain
9. Neuropsychological symptoms (brain fog)
10. Sleep disturbance

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence

**For Gulf War presumptive:**
- DD-214 showing Southwest Asia service
- Documentation of chronic symptoms
- No alternative diagnosis explaining symptoms

**For direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing fatigue symptoms
- Documentation of triggering event (infection, stressor)
- Continuous symptoms since service

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Diagnosis by physician (preferably specialist)
- Documentation of required symptoms
- **Exclusion of other conditions** (critical—tests ruling out thyroid, anemia, sleep disorders, etc.)
- 6+ months of symptoms documented

### Severity Evidence
- Activity logs showing reduced function
- Comparison to pre-illness activity level
- Documentation of incapacitating episodes
- Treatment records
- Work limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review symptom history
2. Verify diagnosis criteria are met
3. Review tests excluding other conditions
4. Assess severity and functional impact
5. Evaluate incapacitating episodes
6. Compare current activity to pre-illness level

**What to tell them:**
- All symptoms you experience
- Your activity level before CFS
- Your current activity level (percentage of pre-illness)
- Incapacitating episodes (dates, duration)
- Impact on work and daily life
- Post-exertional malaise (how activity affects you)

**Document before your exam:**
- Pre-illness activities (work, hobbies, exercise)
- Current limitations
- Episodes requiring bed rest
- How long it takes to recover from activities

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is CFS presumptive for Gulf War veterans?
Yes. CFS is a Gulf War presumptive condition for veterans who served in Southwest Asia and have symptoms that manifested by December 31, 2026.

### What tests do I need?
CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion. You need tests ruling out other conditions (thyroid function, CBC, metabolic panel, sleep study if indicated). The VA needs to know your fatigue isn't from another diagnosable condition.

### How do I prove reduced activity level?
Compare your current capabilities to your pre-illness function. Documentation can include employment records, statements from family/friends, and your own description of changes.

### What's the difference between CFS and fibromyalgia?
CFS is primarily characterized by debilitating fatigue and post-exertional malaise. Fibromyalgia is primarily characterized by widespread pain and tender points. They can overlap and both are Gulf War presumptive conditions.

### Can I be rated for both CFS and fibromyalgia?
Potentially, but there may be pyramiding issues if symptoms overlap significantly. The VA will evaluate based on the predominant symptoms.

### What if my symptoms wax and wane?
That's common with CFS. Track your good and bad periods, and document incapacitating episodes carefully.
