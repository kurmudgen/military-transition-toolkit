# Limited Range of Motion Secondary to Arthritis: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** USUALLY INCLUDED - But adjacent joints can be claimed
- **Key Understanding:** ROM limitation in arthritic joint is typically part of that rating
- **When Separate Claim Works:** Arthritis in one joint causes ROM loss in adjacent joint
- **Example:** Knee arthritis causing hip ROM limitation from altered gait
- **Success rate:** High for adjacent joint claims with proper documentation

**Important:** Understanding what's already included in your rating versus what can be claimed separately is crucial for this type of claim.

## Understanding the Rating Structure

### ROM Already Included in Arthritis Rating

Most joint ratings ARE based on range of motion:
- Knee arthritis rated on flexion/extension limitation
- Shoulder arthritis rated on arm motion limitation
- Spine conditions rated on forward flexion, etc.

**If you have arthritis rated, ROM at that joint is already considered.**

### When ROM CAN Be Claimed Separately

**Adjacent Joint Effects:**
- Knee arthritis → Hip ROM limitation (compensating)
- Hip arthritis → Back ROM limitation
- Ankle arthritis → Knee ROM limitation
- Shoulder arthritis → Neck ROM limitation

**Progression/Worsening:**
- If your ROM decreases, file for **increase** (not secondary claim)

## How Arthritis Causes Adjacent Joint ROM Loss

### Compensatory Movement Patterns

**Mechanism:**
- Original arthritic joint limits normal movement
- Adjacent joints compensate
- Compensatory patterns stress adjacent joints
- ROM in adjacent joints decreases over time

**Example - Knee Arthritis:**
- Knee can't flex fully → Hip flexes more
- Altered gait → Hip joint stress
- Over time → Hip loses ROM
- Can claim hip ROM loss secondary to knee

### Biomechanical Chain Reaction

**Lower Extremity:**
- Ankle affects knee
- Knee affects hip
- Hip affects lumbar spine
- Each can claim next in chain

**Upper Extremity:**
- Shoulder affects elbow
- Elbow affects wrist
- Shoulder affects cervical spine

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

**From Service-Connected Arthritis:**
- Current rating and diagnostic code
- Treatment records
- X-rays showing arthritis severity

**For Adjacent Joint ROM Claim:**
- ROM measurements for the adjacent joint
- Documentation of when ROM loss began
- Physical therapy evaluations
- Any imaging of the adjacent joint

### ROM Measurement Requirements

**Must Include:**
- Goniometric measurements
- Active and passive ROM
- Repetitive use testing (3 repetitions minimum)
- Notation of pain on movement
- Functional loss documentation

**DeLuca Factors:**
- Pain
- Weakness
- Fatigability
- Incoordination
- Additional loss after repetitive use

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

**Must Establish:**
- Service-connected arthritis diagnosis
- Adjacent joint ROM limitation
- How original arthritis caused adjacent joint changes
- Biomechanical explanation

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"[Veteran] is service-connected for right knee osteoarthritis at [X]%.*

*Examination reveals limitation of motion in the right hip:*
*- Flexion: 95° (normal 125°)*
*- Extension: 0° (normal 30°)*
*- Abduction: 25° (normal 45°)*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] right hip limitation of motion is at least as likely as not caused by the service-connected right knee arthritis.*

*Medical Rationale: Knee arthritis significantly alters normal gait mechanics. The restricted knee motion forces compensatory movement patterns through the hip joint. Over time, this abnormal loading results in hip joint stress and progressive limitation of motion. Physical examination findings support this mechanism, as [Veteran] demonstrates antalgic gait with increased hip flexion to compensate for knee extension deficit."*

## Step-by-Step Filing Process

### Step 1: Identify Adjacent Joint Issues

Evaluate joints adjacent to your service-connected arthritis:
- Is there ROM loss?
- Did it develop after your arthritis?
- Is there a biomechanical connection?

### Step 2: Document ROM Limitation

Get objective ROM measurements:
- Physical therapy evaluation
- Orthopedic examination
- Must be goniometric measurements
- Must include repetitive testing

### Step 3: Establish Timeline

Document:
- When original arthritis was diagnosed
- When adjacent joint problems began
- Progression of ROM loss over time

### Step 4: Obtain Nexus Letter

Get physician opinion:
- Explain compensatory mechanism
- Reference gait analysis if available
- Cost: $500-$1,000

### Step 5: File Claim

- VA Form 21-526EZ
- Secondary claim type
- Specify which ROM limitation, which joint
- Upload evidence including ROM measurements

### Step 6: C&P Exam

- Examiner will measure ROM
- Both joints examined
- Bring documentation of worst days
- Don't minimize symptoms

## Common Pathways

### Pathway 1: Knee → Hip

**Chain:**
- Service-connected knee arthritis
- Altered gait pattern
- Hip takes abnormal stress
- Hip ROM decreases

**Rating Potential:** 10-40% for hip

### Pathway 2: Hip → Back

**Chain:**
- Service-connected hip arthritis
- Pelvic tilt compensation
- Lumbar spine stress
- Back ROM decreases

**Rating Potential:** 10-40% for lumbar spine

### Pathway 3: Ankle → Knee

**Chain:**
- Service-connected ankle arthritis
- Abnormal foot strike
- Knee compensates
- Knee ROM decreases

**Rating Potential:** 10-30% for knee

### Pathway 4: Shoulder → Neck

**Chain:**
- Service-connected shoulder arthritis
- Compensatory cervical positioning
- Cervical strain
- Neck ROM decreases

**Rating Potential:** 10-30% for cervical spine

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Claiming ROM at same joint** - Already in your arthritis rating

2. **No objective ROM measurements** - Must have goniometric data

3. **Missing repetitive use testing** - Required for accurate rating

4. **Not documenting compensatory gait** - Key evidence for adjacent joint

5. **Forgetting DeLuca factors** - Pain/functional loss matters

6. **Not explaining biomechanics** - Nexus must explain mechanism

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Knee to Hip

**Background:** 55-year-old veteran, 30% right knee arthritis
- Developed right hip pain over 5 years
- PT documented hip ROM limitation
- Antalgic gait on examination

**Evidence:**
- Hip ROM: Flexion 90° (normal 125°), Abduction 30° (normal 45°)
- Gait analysis showing compensatory pattern
- Orthopedic nexus

**Outcome:** 10% for right hip ROM limitation
**Combined Rating:** 30% → 40%

### Case Study 2: Ankle to Knee

**Background:** 48-year-old veteran, 20% right ankle arthritis
- Left knee now limited ROM
- Compensating for ankle for 8 years
- PT shows decreased knee flexion

**Evidence:**
- Knee flexion 100° (limited by 40° from normal)
- Documented gait alteration
- Nexus explaining contralateral compensation

**Outcome:** 10% for left knee
**Combined Rating:** 20% → 30%

### Case Study 3: Hip to Lumbar Spine

**Background:** 50-year-old veteran, 40% bilateral hip arthritis
- Developed progressive back stiffness
- Lumbar ROM decreased
- Forward flexion now 50°

**Evidence:**
- Lumbar ROM testing
- Biomechanical nexus
- Documentation of pelvic compensation

**Outcome:** 20% for lumbar spine
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 52% (rounds to 50%)

## Special Considerations

### Bilateral Conditions

If you have bilateral arthritis (both knees, both hips):
- Compensatory effects may be more severe
- Document both sides
- May qualify for bilateral factor (10% added)

### Painful Motion

Under 38 CFR § 4.59:
- Painful motion of a major joint is entitled to minimum compensable rating
- Even if ROM measurements don't meet criteria
- Pain must be documented on examination

### Flare-Ups

Document ROM during flare-ups:
- When flares occur
- Estimated ROM during flares
- Functional impact during flares

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"ROM limitation part of original rating"** - Must be adjacent joint
2. **"No nexus establishing connection"**
3. **"ROM measurements don't meet criteria"**

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add biomechanical nexus
- Include gait analysis
- Document functional loss
- Address why adjacent joint affected

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: If my knee arthritis is rated, can I claim knee ROM separately?**
A: No. Your knee rating already accounts for knee ROM limitation.

**Q: What if my ROM is worse than when I was rated?**
A: File for an **increase**, not a secondary claim.

**Q: Do I need a gait analysis?**
A: Not required, but very helpful for adjacent joint claims.

**Q: What if ROM varies day to day?**
A: Document your worst days. Request C&P during flare if possible.

**Q: Can physical therapy help my claim?**
A: PT records documenting ROM limitations and compensatory patterns are excellent evidence.

**Q: How do I know what's normal ROM?**
A: Each joint has established normal values. Your examiner will compare to normal.

**Q: What about multiple adjacent joints?**
A: Each can potentially be claimed. Arthritis often creates a cascade.
