# Migraine Headaches Secondary to TBI: Complete VA Claim Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Can you claim this as secondary?** YES - One of the strongest secondary connections
- **Medical nexus required?** YES
- **Average rating if approved:** 30-50%
- **Key evidence needed:** Service-connected TBI, migraine diagnosis, headache log, nexus letter
- **Success rate:** Very High (80%+) with proper documentation

Post-traumatic headaches, particularly migraines, are among the most common and well-recognized consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury. The VA explicitly acknowledges this connection, making this one of the strongest secondary claims available to veterans with service-connected TBI.

## What Is a Secondary Condition?

Under 38 CFR § 3.310, a secondary service-connected condition develops as a result of an already service-connected disability. Veterans receive additional compensation for secondary conditions.

For migraines secondary to TBI:
- Your TBI must already be service-connected
- You must have a diagnosed migraine or headache disorder
- Medical evidence must link your headaches to your TBI

**Important:** Headaches may already be considered in your TBI rating. A separate migraine rating is appropriate when headaches are severe enough to warrant standalone evaluation.

## How Migraines Relate to TBI

### Medical Connection

Post-traumatic headaches, including migraines, are the most commonly reported symptom after TBI:

**Direct Neurological Damage:**
- TBI damages brain structures involved in pain processing
- Cortical spreading depression (migraine mechanism) more easily triggered after TBI
- Injury to trigeminal nerve pathways produces headache
- Damage to brain's natural pain-suppression systems

**Neuroinflammation:**
- TBI causes chronic brain inflammation
- Inflammatory mediators sensitize headache pathways
- Creates migraine-prone neurological state

**Cervicogenic Component:**
- Many TBI events involve neck injury
- Cervical spine damage contributes to headaches
- Combined mechanism worsens outcomes

**Neurotransmitter Disruption:**
- TBI alters serotonin, norepinephrine, glutamate levels
- These neurotransmitters directly involved in migraine pathophysiology
- Creates biochemical vulnerability to headaches

### Common Progression

**Acute Phase (0-3 months post-TBI):**
- Immediate headache common during recovery
- Headaches may be constant
- Often attributed to TBI itself, not separate diagnosis

**Subacute Phase (3-12 months):**
- Headache pattern becomes clearer
- Migraine features develop (aura, photophobia, nausea)
- Headaches begin to follow migraine patterns
- Triggers become identifiable

**Chronic Phase (12+ months):**
- Post-traumatic migraines established
- 15+ headache days per month common (chronic migraine)
- May develop medication overuse headache
- Significant disability from headaches alone

### Prevalence

Post-traumatic headache is extremely common:

- **57-95% of TBI patients** develop headaches
- **30-40%** meet criteria for chronic daily headache
- **18-33%** meet specific migraine criteria
- Mild TBI actually has **higher** headache rates than severe TBI
- Post-traumatic migraine persists **indefinitely** in many cases
- Veterans with TBI have **4x higher** migraine rates than general population

## VA Rating Criteria for Migraines

Migraines are rated under 38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100:

| Rating | Symptoms | Monthly Compensation (2025) |
|--------|----------|----------------------------|
| 0% | Less frequent attacks | $0.00 |
| 10% | Characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over last several months | $171.23 |
| 30% | Characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over last several months | $524.31 |
| 50% | Very frequent, completely prostrating and prolonged attacks producing severe economic inadaptability | $1,075.16 |

**Key Terms:**
- **Prostrating:** Headache so severe you must lie down; cannot perform normal activities
- **Severe economic inadaptability:** Significant impact on ability to work/earn income (doesn't require unemployment)

**Note:** 50% is the maximum scheduler rating for migraines under DC 8100.

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Records Required

#### From Your Primary Condition (TBI)
- Service connection documentation
- Current TBI rating
- TBI evaluation records
- Documentation of TBI mechanism (blast, impact, etc.)
- Timeline of TBI event

#### For Your Secondary Condition (Migraines)
- Formal diagnosis of migraine disorder or post-traumatic headache
- Treatment records showing ongoing headaches
- Neurology consultation records
- Medication history (triptans, preventives, etc.)
- Emergency room visits for severe headaches
- Brain imaging if available (MRI, CT)

### Headache Log (Critical Evidence)

A detailed headache log is essential. Track for at least 60-90 days:

**For each headache, document:**
- Date and time started
- Duration
- Severity (1-10 scale)
- Location of pain
- Characteristics (throbbing, stabbing, pressure)
- Associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, aura)
- Triggers if identified
- Whether prostrating (had to lie down, stop activities)
- Medications taken and effect
- Impact on daily activities
- Missed work/activities

### The Nexus Letter (Critical)

Your nexus letter must clearly establish TBI caused your migraine disorder.

**Required Elements:**

1. **Provider credentials** - Neurologist preferred; can be other physician
2. **Record review statement**
3. **Migraine diagnosis** - Specific headache disorder diagnosed
4. **Causal statement** - "At least as likely as not" language
5. **TBI-migraine connection** - How your TBI caused migraines
6. **Medical rationale** - Explanation of post-traumatic migraine mechanism

**Example Nexus Language:**

*"I have reviewed [Veteran's] complete medical records, including service treatment records, TBI evaluation records, neurology consultations, and current headache treatment records. [Veteran] is service-connected for Traumatic Brain Injury at [X]%.*

*[Veteran] meets International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria for Post-traumatic Headache/Migraine:
- Headache developed within 7 days of TBI (or within 7 days of regaining consciousness)
- Headache has migraine characteristics: unilateral pulsating pain, moderate-severe intensity, aggravated by physical activity, associated with nausea/photophobia/phonophobia
- Headache persists more than 3 months after TBI (chronic post-traumatic headache)*

*It is my professional opinion that [Veteran's] migraine headache disorder is at least as likely as not (50% probability or greater) caused by the service-connected Traumatic Brain Injury.*

*Medical Rationale: Post-traumatic headache is the most common sequela of TBI, affecting 57-95% of patients. The mechanism involves: (1) direct injury to brain pain-processing structures, (2) neuroinflammation sensitizing trigeminovascular pathways, (3) disruption of neurotransmitter systems involved in migraine pathophysiology, and (4) damage to pain-modulation systems.*

*[Veteran's] records document headaches beginning shortly after the TBI event in [date] and progressing to current chronic migraine pattern. The temporal relationship and clinical presentation are entirely consistent with post-traumatic migraine. Medical literature (Lucas, 2011; Theeler et al., 2013) confirms that TBI is a well-established cause of chronic migraine disorder."*

**Total timeline:** 6-10 months typical

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No headache log** - Without documented frequency and severity, claims are harder to prove

2. **Not documenting prostrating attacks** - The key to higher ratings is proving prostrating attacks

3. **Not claiming separately if in TBI rating** - If headaches have worsened, a separate claim may be warranted

4. **Weak nexus letter** - Generic letters without TBI-specific connection often fail

5. **Not seeing neurologist** - Specialist diagnosis carries more weight

6. **Forgetting associated symptoms** - Nausea, photophobia, phonophobia support migraine diagnosis

7. **Underreporting severity** - Document your worst headaches, not just average ones

8. **Missing work impact documentation** - "Severe economic inadaptability" requires showing work impact

9. **Not trying preventive treatment** - Treatment attempts show severity

10. **Ignoring medication overuse** - If you use rescue medications frequently, document this

## Medical Research Supporting Connection

**Key Studies:**

- **Lucas (2011)** - Comprehensive review establishing post-traumatic headache as primary TBI sequela

- **Theeler et al. (2013)** - Found 36% of service members with TBI develop chronic daily headache

- **Hoffman et al. (2011)** - Veterans with TBI 4x more likely to have migraine than non-TBI veterans

- **Lew et al. (2006)** - Post-traumatic headache most common complaint among veterans with TBI

- **Walker et al. (2005)** - Mild TBI associated with higher headache rates than severe TBI

**VA Recognition:**
The VA Clinical Practice Guidelines for TBI specifically address post-traumatic headache as a primary consequence requiring treatment.

## Real Veteran Examples

### Case Study 1: Approved at 50% Rating

**Background:** 34-year-old Army veteran, 40% TBI from IED blast
**Claim:** Migraine headaches secondary to TBI

**Evidence:**
- Neurology diagnosis of post-traumatic migraine
- 90-day headache log showing 15-18 headache days/month
- 8-10 prostrating attacks per month documented
- Nexus letter from neurologist
- Personal statement describing work impact
- Wife's statement about witnessing severe headaches
- Documentation of multiple emergency room visits

**Key Factors:**
- High frequency of prostrating attacks
- Clear work impact (missed 3-5 days/month)
- Strong neurology documentation

**Outcome:** 50% for migraines secondary to TBI
**Combined Rating:** 40% → 70%
**Monthly Increase:** $641.12 additional

### Case Study 2: Approved at 30% Rating

**Background:** 29-year-old Marine veteran, 10% TBI from blast
**Claim:** Post-traumatic headache secondary to TBI

**Evidence:**
- Primary care diagnosis of chronic post-traumatic headache
- 60-day headache log showing prostrating attacks 1-2x/week
- Nexus letter from treating physician
- Personal statement
- Medication records showing multiple preventive trials

**Outcome:** 30% for headaches secondary to TBI
**Combined Rating:** 10% → 40%
**Monthly Increase:** $524.31

### Case Study 3: Already in TBI Rating, Claimed Separately

**Background:** 42-year-old Navy veteran, 70% TBI (including headaches in that rating)
**Issue:** Headaches had worsened significantly since TBI rating
**Strategy:** Filed for increase specifically for headache component

**Evidence:**
- Updated headache log showing increased frequency
- New neurology evaluation
- Documentation of prostrating attacks now occurring 4x weekly
- Work impact significantly worse

**Outcome:** Separate migraine rating at 50% (in addition to adjusted TBI rating)
**Combined Rating:** 70% → 90%

**Key Lesson:** If headaches worsen after initial TBI rating, a separate claim or increase may be warranted.

## How This Affects Your Combined Rating

**Example 1: TBI 40% + Migraines 50%**
- Start with 50%, 50% healthy
- Apply 40% to remaining: 40% × 50% = 20%
- Combined: 50% + 20% = 70%
- Monthly: $1,716.28

**Example 2: TBI 10% + Migraines 30%**
- Start with 30%, 70% healthy
- Apply 10% to remaining: 10% × 70% = 7%
- Combined: 30% + 7% = 37% → Rounds to 40%
- Monthly: $524.31

**Example 3: TBI + Migraines + PTSD**
- TBI: 40%
- Migraines: 50%
- PTSD: 70%
- Combined: 70% → 85% → 93% → 90%
- Monthly: $2,241.91

## If You're Denied

### Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Headaches contemplated in TBI rating"** - VA says headaches already rated under TBI
2. **"Insufficient evidence of prostrating attacks"** - Need better documentation
3. **"No nexus established"** - Connection not adequately explained
4. **"Headaches not severe enough for separate rating"** - Doesn't meet rating criteria
5. **"Headaches existed before TBI"** - Pre-existing condition claimed

### How to Appeal

**Supplemental Claim:**
- Add detailed headache log
- Obtain stronger nexus from neurologist
- Include additional treatment records
- Document prostrating attacks more clearly

**Higher-Level Review:**
- If evidence was strong but decision incorrect
- Good option if examiner didn't consider headache log

**Board Appeal:**
- For legal arguments about rating criteria
- Can add new evidence

### Strengthening Your Claim

1. **Neurologist evaluation** - Specialist opinion carries significant weight

2. **Comprehensive headache log** - 90+ days with detailed entries

3. **Document prostrating attacks** - Specific dates/times when you had to stop all activity

4. **Work impact evidence** - Show economic inadaptability with documentation

5. **Emergency room records** - If you've had ER visits for headaches, include these

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between headaches rated with TBI vs. separate migraine rating?**
A: TBI rating may include headaches as one factor. A separate migraine rating evaluates headaches under their own criteria and can add significantly to combined rating.

**Q: Can I have both a TBI rating with headaches and a separate migraine rating?**
A: Potentially, but VA generally avoids rating same symptoms twice. If headaches are severe enough, they can be rated separately.

**Q: What if my headaches started months after my TBI?**
A: Post-traumatic headache can develop months after TBI. Document the timeline and include in nexus letter.

**Q: Do I need to prove I never had headaches before TBI?**
A: If headaches clearly worsened after TBI, you can claim aggravation of pre-existing condition.

**Q: What counts as a "prostrating" attack?**
A: Headache so severe you must lie down in dark/quiet room and cannot perform normal activities. Must stop work, household tasks, etc.

**Q: How many prostrating attacks do I need for 50% rating?**
A: "Very frequent" prostrating attacks with "severe economic inadaptability." Generally interpreted as multiple prostrating attacks monthly affecting work.

**Q: Can I get more than 50% for migraines?**
A: 50% is maximum scheduler rating. TDIU is possible if migraines prevent employment.

**Q: What if I only have tension headaches, not migraines?**
A: Any chronic headache disorder can be secondary to TBI. Tension-type headaches are also rated under similar criteria.

**Q: Do I need a CT or MRI for headache claim?**
A: Not required, but can support claim if abnormalities are found.

**Q: What triggers should I document?**
A: Light, noise, activity, stress, weather changes, certain foods—any triggers you notice.

**Q: Will claiming migraines affect my TBI rating?**
A: It could result in re-evaluation of TBI rating to avoid pyramiding, but total compensation typically increases.

**Q: What if preventive medications help my headaches?**
A: Document that you require medication. Controlled symptoms still demonstrate underlying condition.

**Q: Can I claim migraines secondary to neck injury instead of TBI?**
A: Yes, cervicogenic headache secondary to neck condition is also valid secondary claim.

**Q: How do I prove "severe economic inadaptability"?**
A: Document missed work, reduced hours, job loss, career limitations, accommodations needed.

**Q: What's the best headache tracking app?**
A: Migraine Buddy, iHeadache, and Bearable are popular options. Paper log is also acceptable.

**Q: Should I track every headache or just severe ones?**
A: Track all headaches, but clearly identify which are prostrating.

**Q: What if my headaches are worse some months than others?**
A: Document the pattern. VA looks at average over several months.

**Q: Can I claim migraines if I already have chronic daily headache in TBI rating?**
A: If migraine symptoms are distinct or headaches have worsened, you may have grounds for separate rating.

**Q: What neurologist should I see for nexus letter?**
A: Any board-certified neurologist familiar with post-traumatic headache and VA claims process.

**Q: How does medication overuse headache affect my claim?**
A: It actually supports severity—shows you're using rescue medication frequently due to frequent severe headaches.
