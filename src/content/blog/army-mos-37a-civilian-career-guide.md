## Bottom Line Up Front

Psychological Operations Officers transitioning out—you're not looking for another military job, you're choosing your next strategic influence mission. Your **strategic messaging and narrative development, influence campaign planning and execution, psychological operations expertise, cultural and audience analysis, multi-media content creation, cross-functional team leadership, security clearance, and proven ability to shape perceptions and influence behavior in complex environments** make you one of the most sought-after professionals in strategic communications, corporate messaging, public affairs, and influence operations. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$85,000-$120,000** in government strategic communications or corporate communications management roles, scaling to **$130,000-$190,000** in strategic communications director, influence operations contractor, or senior public affairs positions. Top-tier PSYOP Officers leading corporate communications divisions, serving as chief communications officers, or commanding strategic advisory firms can earn **$200,000-$350,000+**. Your unique combination of strategic thinking, messaging expertise, and operational execution is rare—and highly compensated.

Here's what separates you from civilian communications professionals: **You've actually planned and executed influence campaigns in denied environments, measured behavioral change, operated under operational security constraints, and delivered measurable results where failure had strategic consequences.** That's not corporate PR theory—that's operational communications expertise Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and strategic consulting firms pay premium dollars to acquire.

You didn't just "plan psychological operations." You:
- Developed comprehensive influence campaigns targeting specific audiences with measurable behavioral objectives
- Conducted rigorous target audience analysis (TAA) examining demographics, psychographics, cultural factors, information environment, and influence vulnerabilities
- Designed multi-platform messaging strategies integrating print, radio, television, social media, face-to-face engagement, and digital channels
- Led PSYOP product development creating persuasive content tested for cultural appropriateness and message resonance
- Coordinated with interagency partners (State Department, USAID, CIA, partner nations) on strategic messaging and information operations
- Assessed information environment and adversary messaging, developing counter-messaging campaigns
- Managed PSYOP Tactical Teams (PTTs) executing influence operations in combat zones
- Held Top Secret/SCI clearance and advised commanders on psychological warfare and information operations

That's strategic communications planning, audience segmentation and analysis, integrated marketing communications, content strategy, campaign management, and performance measurement. The civilian world desperately needs professionals who can plan, execute, and measure influence campaigns—and your military experience is directly transferable.

## Best civilian career paths for 37A Psychological Operations Officers

Let's get specific. Here are the fields where PSYOP Officers consistently land, with real 2024-2025 salary data.

### Strategic communications and corporate messaging (most direct path)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Director of Strategic Communications
- Corporate Communications Director
- VP of Communications
- Chief Communications Officer (CCO)
- Integrated Marketing Communications Director
- Brand Strategy Director
- Executive Communications Director

**Salary ranges:**
- **Communications Manager (entry to field):** $85,000-$120,000
- **Director of Strategic Communications:** $105,000-$185,000
- **Corporate Communications Director:** $115,000-$170,000
- **VP of Communications:** $150,000-$230,000
- **Chief Communications Officer:** $200,000-$400,000+
- **Brand Strategy Director:** $140,000-$250,000

**What translates directly:**
- Strategic messaging development (you created influence campaigns—that's corporate messaging strategy)
- Audience analysis and segmentation (TAA = market segmentation and persona development)
- Multi-channel campaign planning (print, digital, broadcast, social media—same platforms, different purpose)
- Content development and testing (PSYOP product development = content marketing and creative strategy)
- Crisis communication (counter-messaging adversaries = crisis PR and reputation management)
- Stakeholder engagement (civil-military coordination = internal/external stakeholder management)
- Performance measurement (PMESII assessment = PR measurement and campaign analytics)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required; master's in Communications, Strategic Communications, or MBA preferred)
- **APR (Accredited in Public Relations)** ($385 exam; 5+ years experience required)—gold standard PR credential
- **Strategic communications training** (many corporate programs available—$1,000-$5,000)
- **Digital marketing certifications** (Google Analytics, HubSpot, Hootsuite—free to $500)
- **Security clearance** (maintain if possible—worth $15K-$30K for government/defense contractors)

**Reality check:**

This is your most direct and highest-paying transition path. Corporations, government agencies, and nonprofits need professionals who can develop strategic messages, influence stakeholder behavior, manage complex campaigns, and measure results. Your PSYOP experience is exactly what they're looking for—you just need to translate it into civilian language.

Major corporations (Fortune 500), PR agencies (Edelman, Weber Shandwick, FleishmanHillard), and government contractors (Booz Allen, CACI, Leidos) actively hire former PSYOP Officers for strategic communications roles. Your military background provides credibility, strategic thinking, and operational discipline most civilian communicators lack.

Salary progression: Start at $90K-$120K as Communications Manager or Senior Communications Specialist. Within 3-5 years, reach Director level earning $130K-$185K. By year 7-10, VP-level positions pay $180K-$250K+. Chief Communications Officers at major companies earn $250K-$500K.

The work involves developing corporate messaging strategies, managing internal/external communications, crisis communications, executive communications, media relations, and brand positioning. It's strategic planning and execution—exactly what you did in PSYOP, just for corporate objectives rather than military missions.

**Best for:** PSYOP Officers who want to leverage strategic messaging skills, enjoy corporate environments, and want maximum earning potential while staying in communications strategy.

### Public affairs and government strategic communications

**Civilian job titles:**
- Public Affairs Specialist (Government)
- Strategic Communications Officer (DoD, State Department)
- Information Operations Planner (Contractor)
- Influence Operations Analyst
- Military Information Support Operations (MISO) Planner
- Messaging and Communications Advisor (USAID, State)
- Psychological Operations SME (Contractor)

**Salary ranges:**
- **Public Affairs Specialist (GS-11 to GS-13):** $70,000-$120,000 (with locality)
- **Strategic Communications Officer (GS-13 to GS-14):** $95,000-$145,000
- **MISO/PSYOP Planner (Contractor):** $104,000-$166,000
- **Influence Operations Analyst (Contractor):** $110,000-$175,000
- **Senior Advisor (GS-15/Contractor):** $130,000-$190,000

**Top companies hiring 37A veterans:**
- **Leidos National Security Sector**
- **Amentum**
- **SkyBridge Tactical**
- **Strategic Resilience Group (SRG)**
- **The Ascendancy Group**
- **Peraton**
- **CACI International**
- **Booz Allen Hamilton**
- **Green Cell Consulting** (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned)

**What translates directly:**

Everything. You're doing the same work you did in uniform, just as a civilian supporting DoD, State Department, or Combatant Commands. Government contractors need experienced MISO/PSYOP planners to support USSOCOM, USASOC, 4th and 8th PSYOP Groups, and theater special operations commands.

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required; master's preferred for senior positions)
- **Active TS/SCI clearance** (non-negotiable—maintain yours if possible)
- **POQC graduate** (Psychological Operations Qualification Course—you have this)
- **MPDAC** (MISO Program Design and Assessment Course—valuable for senior planning roles)
- **Joint Professional Military Education** (if you have intermediate or senior PME, it helps)

**Reality check:**

This path keeps you in the PSYOP/MISO community supporting active-duty operations. You'll plan influence campaigns, develop products, conduct assessments, train active-duty personnel, and support deployed operations—but as a civilian contractor earning $110K-$175K instead of military pay.

Most positions require active TS/SCI clearance and recent operational experience. If your clearance lapsed, factor 12-18 months for reinvestigation. If you don't have recent deployments or operational assignments, you may be less competitive.

Work locations are primarily Fort Liberty (NC), Tampa (USSOCOM), or OCONUS supporting combatant commands. Rotational deployments are common—expect 3-6 month rotations supporting theater operations.

Hiring timeline: 6-12 weeks for contractor positions once you apply. Government civilian positions (GS scale) take 4-8 months.

Lifestyle: You'll work 50-60 hour weeks, deploy periodically, and operate in classified environments. But you're doing mission-focused work with operational impact, earning significantly more than active duty.

**Best for:** PSYOP Officers who want to continue supporting military operations, have active clearances, and prefer mission-driven work over corporate careers.

### Marketing and advertising (corporate sector pivot)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Marketing Communications Director
- Brand Marketing Director
- Content Strategy Director
- Creative Director (Advertising Agencies)
- Growth Marketing Director
- Digital Marketing Director
- Integrated Marketing Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Marketing Communications Manager:** $80,000-$115,000
- **Marketing Communications Director:** $110,000-$175,000
- **Brand Marketing Director:** $120,000-$185,000
- **Content Strategy Director:** $135,000-$220,000
- **Creative Director (Advertising):** $100,000-$165,000
- **VP of Marketing:** $150,000-$250,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Campaign planning and execution (influence campaigns = marketing campaigns)
- Audience segmentation and targeting (TAA = customer personas and market segmentation)
- Multi-channel integration (you coordinated across platforms—that's omnichannel marketing)
- Message testing and optimization (PSYOP testing = A/B testing and message optimization)
- Competitive analysis (threat assessment = competitive intelligence)
- Performance metrics and analytics (PMESII effects assessment = marketing KPIs and ROI)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree in Marketing, Communications, or related field** (required; MBA is highly valued—adds $20K-$40K)
- **Digital marketing certifications** (Google Ads, Google Analytics, HubSpot Inbound Marketing—free to $500)
- **Content marketing certification** (Content Marketing Institute, HubSpot—$200-$1,000)
- **Marketing analytics** (Google Analytics certification, marketing automation platforms)

**Reality check:**

Marketing and advertising require more than strategic thinking—you need business acumen, ROI measurement, sales alignment, and comfort with commercial objectives. PSYOP's behavioral influence approach translates well conceptually, but you'll need to learn marketing technology platforms (CRM, marketing automation, analytics) and business metrics (customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, conversion rates).

Major brands, advertising agencies (Ogilvy, BBDO, McCann), and tech companies hire former PSYOP Officers for their strategic thinking and campaign execution skills. However, you're competing with career marketers who have brand management and P&L experience.

Salary progression: Start at $85K-$110K as Marketing Manager or Senior Marketing Specialist. Reach Director level ($120K-$175K) within 4-6 years. VP-level positions ($180K-$250K) typically require 10+ years total experience including military.

Work involves developing go-to-market strategies, managing brand positioning, executing integrated campaigns, analyzing marketing performance, and driving revenue growth. It's more commercial and sales-focused than government communications, but your strategic campaign skills are highly relevant.

**Best for:** PSYOP Officers interested in business and commercial marketing, comfortable with sales objectives, and wanting to apply influence skills to consumer behavior and brand building.

### Public relations and media relations (agency and corporate)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Public Relations Manager
- Media Relations Director
- Crisis Communications Specialist
- Reputation Management Director
- PR Account Director (Agency)
- Communications Consultant

**Salary ranges:**
- **PR Manager:** $70,000-$105,000
- **PR Director:** $100,000-$145,000
- **Crisis Communications Specialist:** $85,000-$140,000
- **Media Relations Director:** $95,000-$155,000
- **VP of Public Relations:** $130,000-$200,000
- **PR Agency Principal/Partner:** $150,000-$300,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Media strategy and engagement (you developed information products for media dissemination)
- Crisis communications (counter-messaging = crisis PR and reputation management)
- Message development and positioning (PSYOP messaging = PR messaging and positioning)
- Stakeholder management (interagency coordination = client and stakeholder management)
- Issues management (information environment assessment = issues monitoring and management)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree in PR, Communications, Journalism** (required; master's preferred)
- **APR (Accredited in Public Relations)** ($385 exam after 5 years experience)—industry gold standard
- **Media training certifications** (various providers—$500-$2,000)
- **Crisis communications training** (PRSA, Institute for Crisis Management—$1,000-$5,000)

**Reality check:**

Public relations emphasizes media relationships, earned media (press coverage), and reputation management. It's less about paid campaigns (that's advertising/marketing) and more about managing narratives through media, thought leadership, and stakeholder engagement.

Top PR agencies (Edelman, Weber Shandwick, FleishmanHillard, Brunswick Group) and corporate PR departments hire former military for crisis communications and strategic counsel. Your ability to operate under pressure, manage sensitive information, and develop strategic narratives is highly valued.

However, PR requires strong writing skills, media savvy, and relationship building with journalists and influencers. If you're weak on writing or uncomfortable with media, you'll struggle.

Salary progression is moderate: $75K-$95K starting, $110K-$145K at director level (5-7 years), $150K-$200K for VP roles (10+ years). Top agency principals and CCOs earn $200K-$400K but that requires 15-20 years building expertise and client relationships.

**Best for:** PSYOP Officers with strong writing skills, interest in media and journalism, comfort with public-facing roles, and desire to work in corporate or agency PR environments.

### Social media and digital influence (emerging high-growth field)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Social Media Strategy Director
- Digital Influence Manager
- Social Media Director
- Online Community Director
- Influencer Marketing Manager
- Digital Engagement Director

**Salary ranges:**
- **Social Media Manager:** $60,000-$85,000
- **Social Media Strategy Director:** $85,000-$140,000
- **Director of Digital Influence:** $100,000-$160,000
- **VP of Social Media:** $130,000-$200,000
- **Independent Social Media Consultant:** $80,000-$200,000+ (variable)

**What translates directly:**
- Social media influence campaigns (you executed influence operations across social platforms)
- Audience analysis and targeting (TAA on social media platforms = social listening and audience insights)
- Content creation and curation (PSYOP products = social media content strategy)
- Influence network mapping (you analyzed influence networks—that's influencer identification and partnership)
- Message testing and optimization (A/B testing messaging = social media optimization)
- Community engagement and management (populace engagement = online community management)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required for most corporate positions)
- **Social media certifications** (Hootsuite, HubSpot Social Media, Meta Blueprint—free to $300)
- **Digital analytics** (Google Analytics, social media analytics platforms)
- **Content creation tools** (Adobe Creative Suite, Canva, video editing)

**Reality check:**

Social media strategy is younger, more dynamic, and less structured than traditional communications. You'll need hands-on proficiency with platforms (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Facebook), analytics tools, content creation software, and understanding of trends, algorithms, and platform best practices.

Your PSYOP background in social media influence operations is highly relevant—but civilian social media moves faster, with less planning and more rapid iteration. You'll need to adapt from methodical military planning to agile social media execution.

Tech companies, consumer brands, PR agencies, and consulting firms hire social media strategists. Competition is fierce from younger digital natives, but your strategic thinking and campaign planning experience differentiate you.

Salary progression: $65K-$85K starting as Social Media Manager, $95K-$140K as Director (4-6 years), $140K-$200K for VP roles (8-10 years). Many former PSYOP Officers build independent consulting practices earning $100K-$200K+ working with multiple clients.

**Best for:** PSYOP Officers who are digitally savvy, comfortable with rapidly evolving platforms, creative and adaptable, and interested in digital communications and online influence.

### Government relations and advocacy (influence through policy)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Government Relations Director
- Public Policy Director
- Legislative Affairs Director
- Advocacy Director
- Stakeholder Engagement Director
- Government Affairs Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Government Relations Manager:** $80,000-$120,000
- **Director of Government Relations:** $110,000-$170,000
- **VP of Government Affairs:** $140,000-$220,000
- **Chief Government Relations Officer:** $180,000-$300,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Stakeholder influence and engagement (you influenced key leaders—that's government relations)
- Policy analysis and advocacy messaging (information environment assessment = policy analysis)
- Coalition building (interagency coordination = coalition and advocacy network building)
- Strategic messaging for decision-makers (influence campaigns targeting leaders = advocacy campaigns)

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required; master's in Public Policy, Public Administration, or Law highly valued)
- **Government relations training** (various associations offer programs—$1,000-$5,000)
- **Lobbying compliance certifications** (if working as registered lobbyist)
- **Deep understanding of legislative/regulatory process**

**Reality check:**

Government relations and lobbying require understanding policy, legislative processes, regulatory frameworks, and political dynamics. If you don't have policy background or interest in government affairs, this path will be challenging.

Corporations, trade associations, advocacy nonprofits, and government relations firms hire government relations professionals. Defense contractors particularly value former military for their DoD relationships and understanding of defense policy.

Salaries are strong ($110K-$220K for directors and VPs) but competition is intense. You're competing with former Hill staffers, policy wonks, and career government relations professionals. Your military experience helps with defense-related government relations but less so for other sectors.

**Best for:** PSYOP Officers interested in policy and government affairs, comfortable operating in political environments, and wanting to influence through legislative and regulatory advocacy.

## Skills translation table (for your resume)

Stop writing "37A Psychological Operations Officer" on your resume and assuming civilians understand what that means. Translate it:

| Military Experience | Civilian Translation |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Psychological Operations Officer (37A) | Strategic communications professional with 8+ years developing and executing multi-channel influence campaigns across complex cultural and operational environments |
| Influence campaign planning | Strategic communications campaign planner designing integrated messaging strategies across print, broadcast, digital, and social media channels |
| Target Audience Analysis (TAA) | Market research and audience segmentation specialist analyzing demographics, psychographics, cultural factors, and behavioral drivers to inform messaging strategy |
| PSYOP product development | Content strategist and creative director developing persuasive multimedia content (print, video, radio, digital) tested for audience resonance and cultural appropriateness |
| Information environment assessment | Competitive intelligence and media monitoring analyst assessing stakeholder perceptions, adversary messaging, and information landscape to inform communications strategy |
| Multi-platform campaign execution | Integrated marketing communications manager coordinating messaging across print, broadcast, digital, social media, and face-to-face engagement channels |
| Message testing and evaluation | Marketing researcher conducting A/B testing, focus groups, and quantitative analysis to optimize message effectiveness and campaign ROI |
| Interagency coordination | Cross-functional team leader coordinating with multiple stakeholders (marketing, sales, legal, executives, external partners) on strategic communications initiatives |
| Top Secret/SCI clearance | Active TS/SCI security clearance (specify level and poly status if applicable) |
| PSYOP Tactical Team Leadership | Communications team leader managing 5-10 specialists executing field operations, content production, and stakeholder engagement |

Use **quantifiable campaign metrics**: "Planned and executed 15 influence campaigns reaching 500K+ audience members with 40% behavioral change rate," "Developed 200+ multimedia products (video, print, radio, digital) supporting $10M strategic communications program," "Led 8-person team producing 50+ content pieces monthly across 6 platforms."

Drop military jargon. Don't write "PSYOP," "PMESII," or "MILDEC" without translation. Write "strategic influence campaigns," "comprehensive stakeholder analysis examining political, military, economic, social, information, and infrastructure factors," and "deception and counter-messaging operations."

## Certifications that actually matter

Here's what's worth your time and GI Bill as a PSYOP Officer:

### High priority (get these):

**Bachelor's degree (Communications, Marketing, Public Relations, Strategic Communications, or related field)** - Required for all corporate and agency positions. Use your GI Bill if you don't have it. Cost: $0 with GI Bill. Time: 4 years (or less with credits). Value: Non-negotiable—opens all doors.

**Master's degree (Strategic Communications, MBA, Public Relations, or Marketing)** - Significantly increases salary potential ($20K-$50K) and positions you for director-level roles immediately. Top programs: Georgetown, USC Annenberg, Syracuse Newhouse, Columbia, Northwestern Medill, Georgetown McDonough (MBA). Cost: $0-$80K (GI Bill covers ~$27K/year; Yellow Ribbon programs cover rest at many schools). Value: Fast-tracks you to director and VP-level roles.

**APR (Accredited in Public Relations)** - Industry gold standard for PR professionals. Requires 5 years experience and passing written/oral exams. Cost: $385 exam (PRSA members get $100 rebate). Value: Differentiates you from non-credentialed communicators; adds credibility and $10K-$20K in earning potential.

**Digital Marketing Certifications** - Google Analytics, Google Ads, HubSpot Inbound Marketing, Hootsuite Social Media. Most are free or low-cost. Cost: $0-$500. Value: Demonstrates digital proficiency and modern marketing skills—increasingly required.

**Maintain your security clearance** - Find a job requiring clearance within 2 years or it lapses. Cost: $0 if kept active. Value: Worth $15K-$30K premium for government contractor strategic communications roles.

### Medium priority (if it fits your path):

**Content Marketing Certification** - Content Marketing Institute, HubSpot Content Marketing. Cost: $200-$1,000. Value: Strengthens content strategy credentials if targeting content-focused roles.

**Crisis Communications Training** - Institute for Crisis Management, PRSA programs. Cost: $1,000-$5,000. Value: Positions you for high-paying crisis communications roles ($120K-$180K).

**Marketing Analytics and Data** - Certifications in marketing analytics, data analysis, or business intelligence. Cost: $500-$3,000. Value: Demonstrates quantitative skills and ROI measurement capability—increasingly important.

**Public Speaking and Presentation Skills** - Toastmasters (free), professional speaking courses ($500-$2,000). Value: Critical for senior communications roles involving executive presentations and media appearances.

### Low priority (nice to have, not critical):

**Sector-specific certifications** - Healthcare communications, financial services communications, etc. Cost: $500-$2,000. Value: Relevant only if targeting specific industries.

**Design and creative software** - Adobe Creative Suite certifications. Cost: $200-$1,000. Value: Helpful for hands-on content creation roles but not required for strategic director positions.

## The skills gap (what you need to learn)

Be brutally honest. There are civilian skills you need to develop:

**Business and commercial acumen:** Corporate communications serves business objectives—revenue growth, market share, customer acquisition, brand value. You need to understand P&L, ROI, business strategy, and commercial objectives. Take business courses or pursue MBA if targeting corporate roles.

**Media relations and journalism:** If pursuing PR, you need to understand how journalists work, what makes news, how to pitch stories, and how to build media relationships. Read industry publications, take media training, and study PR case studies.

**Digital proficiency:** Civilian communications is increasingly digital. You need hands-on skills with social media platforms, analytics tools, content management systems, marketing automation, and digital advertising platforms. Take courses and get certified.

**Writing for business audiences:** Military writing is directive and factual. Business writing is persuasive, audience-focused, and commercially oriented. Practice writing press releases, blog posts, marketing copy, and executive communications. Have professionals review your work.

**Collaboration over command:** Military leadership is hierarchical. Corporate communications requires influencing without authority, building consensus, managing up, and collaborative decision-making. Adjust your leadership style.

**Networking and personal branding:** Communications careers are relationship-driven. Join professional associations (PRSA, IABC, American Marketing Association), attend conferences, build LinkedIn presence, and network aggressively. Jobs are filled through connections more than applications.

### Months 1-2: Foundation and positioning

- Get 10 certified copies of DD-214

### Months 3-4: Credentialing and skill-building

- Enroll in master's program if pursuing corporate track and don't have graduate degree (MBA or Strategic Communications—use GI Bill)

- Tailor each resume emphasizing campaign planning, audience analysis, content strategy, and team leadership—minimize military jargon
- Network aggressively—reach out to hiring managers and communications leaders before/after applying
- Practice interviews translating PSYOP work into communications language (influence campaigns = marketing campaigns; TAA = audience research; PSYOP products = content development)

## Bottom line for 37A Psychological Operations Officers

Your PSYOP experience is exactly what strategic communications, marketing, and corporate messaging organizations need—professionals who can plan campaigns, understand audiences, create persuasive content, measure impact, and deliver results.

You've proven you can develop influence strategies, analyze complex audiences, create culturally-appropriate messaging, execute multi-channel campaigns, measure behavioral change, operate under pressure, and adapt to rapidly changing environments. That's not entry-level communications work—that's senior strategic communications expertise corporate America pays $120K-$200K+ to acquire.

Fortune 500 companies, PR agencies, government contractors, and marketing firms actively seek former PSYOP Officers. You're not starting from scratch—you're entering at manager or director levels based on your experience.

First-year income of $90K-$120K is realistic in corporate communications or PR agency roles. Within 5 years, $130K-$175K is achievable as Director of Communications or senior agency leader. By year 8-12, VP-level positions pay $180K-$250K. Chief Communications Officers at major corporations earn $250K-$500K.

Your security clearance, operational experience, strategic thinking, and proven campaign execution are worth $20K-$40K in differentiation from civilian communications professionals. Use transition programs (Hiring Our Heroes, Corporate Gray), join professional associations (PRSA, IABC), translate military experience effectively, and network relentlessly.

You've spent years shaping perceptions, influencing behavior, and achieving strategic objectives through communications. Now you'll do the same work—building brands, managing reputations, driving business results, and influencing stakeholders. Your skills transfer directly. Execute the transition.
