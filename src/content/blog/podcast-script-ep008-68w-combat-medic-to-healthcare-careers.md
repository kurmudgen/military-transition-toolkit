[INTRO - 60 seconds]

**Cold Open (15 seconds):**

You're a 68 Whiskey. You've provided medical care under fire, you've saved lives in impossible conditions, and you have skills that civilian healthcare desperately needs. But here's the problem - your military training doesn't automatically translate to the civilian certifications you need. [pause] Today we're fixing that and showing you the path from combat medic to six-figure healthcare careers.

**Theme Music: [5 seconds]**

**Host Introduction (20 seconds):**

This is Veteran Transition Blueprint. I'm Jacob, a Navy E6 going through medical retirement, and today we're talking specifically to Army Combat Medics - 68 Whiskeys. Whether you're planning to become an EMT, paramedic, nurse, or physician assistant, this episode breaks down the complete career path, the certifications you need, and the salary you can expect at each level.

**Episode Preview (20 seconds):**

We're covering the civilian healthcare career ladder from EMT at forty thousand to Registered Nurse at ninety thousand to Nurse Practitioner at one hundred twenty thousand and beyond. You'll learn which certifications you already have, which ones you need to get, and the exact timeline to transition from 68W to high-paying healthcare careers. Let's dive in.

[MAIN CONTENT - 24-26 minutes]

**Segment 1: Your 68W Training and the Civilian Certification Gap (5 minutes)**

Let's start with what you already have and where the gap exists.

Your 68W training at Fort Sam Houston is 16 weeks of intensive medical training. The first half focuses on basic emergency medical care - you learn CPR, basic life support, trauma care, patient assessment. This portion culminates in you taking the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians exam - that's NREMT, N-R-E-M-T.

If you passed that exam, you're a certified EMT. That's your baseline civilian healthcare credential. You walked out of AIT with an EMT certification that's recognized nationwide.

The second half of 68W training goes beyond civilian EMT scope. You learn advanced trauma care, combat casualty care, tactical medicine - skills that EMTs don't typically have. You learn to perform emergency procedures that in the civilian world are usually done by paramedics or physicians.

This creates an interesting situation. [pause] Your actual skill level and experience exceed what your EMT certification represents.

If you've been a 68W for a few years - especially if you deployed - you've probably:
- Managed trauma patients with multiple injuries
- Performed advanced airway management
- Started IVs and administered medications
- Treated burns, fractures, and gunshot wounds
- Made life-or-death medical decisions with limited resources
- Provided care in austere environments

That's way beyond what civilian EMTs do. Civilian EMTs mostly provide basic care and transportation to hospitals. They don't perform surgical airways or manage complex trauma like you've done.

But here's the challenge: [emphasis: "The civilian healthcare system doesn't automatically recognize your advanced military training as equivalent to paramedic or higher certifications."]

Research published in 2023 found that the scope of practice for Army 68W Combat Medics aligns well with civilian Advanced EMT - that's AEMT - and in many cases approaches paramedic level. But transitioning from military to civilian EMS is challenging because the pathway isn't clearly defined.

Many 68Ws express frustration that despite their extensive training and combat experience, they have to start at the EMT level in civilian healthcare, which pays significantly less than what their skills are worth.

So here's the reality: You're certified as an EMT, but you need additional civilian certifications to get paid what you're actually worth and to practice at the level you're trained for.

The good news? You've got a head start. You've already got medical knowledge and hands-on experience that other people pay tens of thousands of dollars and years of schooling to acquire.

Now let's talk about the career pathways and what they pay.

**Segment 2: The Healthcare Career Ladder - EMT to Paramedic to RN (6 minutes)**

Let me break down the major career paths and salary ranges at each level.

**Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)**

This is where you start if you just have your NREMT certification from 68W training.

Job description: Provide basic emergency medical care, transport patients to hospitals, work on ambulances or for fire departments.

Salary: The median annual wage for EMTs was $41,340 in May 2024. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $31,410. The highest 10 percent earned more than $60,780.

That breaks down to about $20 per hour on average. Some urban areas pay better - big city fire departments might pay $50K to $60K for EMTs - but in many areas, EMT pay is disappointing considering the responsibility and difficulty of the work.

EMT is a stepping stone, not a destination. Most 68Ws should plan to move beyond EMT level within 1-2 years.

**Paramedic**

This is the next level up. Paramedics have advanced training and can perform more invasive procedures - advanced airway management, cardiac monitoring, IV medications, emergency medications, advanced trauma care.

Job description: Provide advanced life support, manage critical patients, work on ambulances, helicopters (flight paramedics), or in emergency departments.

Salary: The median annual wage for paramedics was $58,410 in May 2024. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $40,130. The highest 10 percent earned more than $82,420.

Flight paramedics and critical care paramedics can make even more - $70K to $90K in some markets.

This is a solid career if you want to stay in emergency medicine. But there's a ceiling. Most paramedics top out around $70K to $80K unless they move into management or specialized roles.

**Registered Nurse (RN)**

This is where healthcare careers really start to pay. RNs work in hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, schools, and countless other settings.

Job description: Provide and coordinate patient care, educate patients, provide emotional support, work in various specialties - emergency, ICU, surgery, pediatrics, etc.

Salary: The median annual wage for registered nurses was $93,600 in May 2024. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $66,030. The highest 10 percent earned more than $135,320.

Let me repeat that - the median is ninety-three thousand, six hundred dollars. [pause] That's more than double what paramedics make.

RNs in high-demand areas or specialties make even more. ICU nurses, emergency room nurses, operating room nurses - they can make $90K to $120K+. Travel nurses can make $100K to $150K+ because they get housing stipends and premium pay for temporary assignments.

**The path to RN requires a nursing degree** - either an Associate's Degree in Nursing (ADN) which is 2 years, or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) which is 4 years. Then you take the NCLEX exam - that's N-C-L-E-X, the nursing licensure exam.

Your 68W experience gives you a huge advantage in nursing school. You already understand medical terminology, patient care, anatomy and physiology. Nursing school will be easier for you than for someone with zero medical background.

**Nurse Practitioner (NP) or Physician Assistant (PA)**

These are advanced practice roles. NPs and PAs can diagnose illnesses, order tests, prescribe medications - they function similarly to physicians in many settings.

Salary for Nurse Practitioners: $120,000 to $140,000+ median, depending on specialty and location.

Salary for Physician Assistants: $130,000 to $150,000+ median.

The path to NP requires a Master's degree (2-3 additional years after your BSN). The path to PA requires a Master's degree specifically in Physician Assistant studies (2-3 years).

These are excellent long-term career goals for 68Ws who want to stay in healthcare and maximize earning potential.

**Other Healthcare Career Options:**

**Surgical Technologist**: Assist during surgeries. Median salary $60K. Requires certification program, usually 9-24 months.

**Radiologic Technologist**: Perform X-rays and imaging. Median salary $73K. Requires associate's degree and certification.

**Respiratory Therapist**: Treat breathing disorders. Median salary $77K. Requires associate's degree and license.

**Occupational Therapy Assistant**: Help patients with rehabilitation. Median salary $64K. Requires associate's degree.

These are all solid careers that pay better than EMT and don't require a full 4-year nursing degree.

**Segment 3: The Certification and Education Path (6 minutes)**

Alright, let's talk about exactly what you need to do to move up the healthcare career ladder.

**Step 1: Maintain your EMT certification**

Your NREMT certification from 68W training expires after 2 years. You need to complete continuing education and recertify.

If your NREMT cert has lapsed, you can usually recertify by taking a refresher course and retaking the exam. Cost is around $100 to $300 for a refresher course plus exam fees.

Make sure you maintain your EMT cert. It's your baseline credential that everything else builds on.

**Step 2: Get a civilian EMT job or paramedic bridging program**

You have two paths to paramedic:

**Path A: Work as an EMT while attending paramedic school**

Get hired by an ambulance company or fire department as an EMT. Work for 1-2 years while attending paramedic school part-time or full-time.

Paramedic programs are typically 12 to 24 months. They include classroom instruction and clinical rotations. Cost ranges from $5,000 to $30,000 depending on the program.

You can use your GI Bill to cover paramedic school tuition.

**Path B: Paramedic bridging programs for 68Ws**

Some schools offer accelerated paramedic programs specifically for military medics. These recognize your military training and let you test out of portions of the curriculum or complete the program faster.

For example, some programs let 68Ws complete paramedic training in 6-12 months instead of the usual 18-24 months.

Look for programs that specifically advertise military-friendly or 68W-to-paramedic pathways.

**Step 3: Decide - Paramedic or Nursing?**

This is the big decision point.

If you want to work in emergency medicine, prehospital care, or get into the field quickly, go the paramedic route. You can be working as a paramedic within 1-2 years and making $58K to $80K+.

If you want higher long-term earning potential and more career options, go the nursing route. It takes longer - 2 to 4 years for your RN degree - but you'll make $90K+ as an RN and have options to specialize or advance to NP.

Many 68Ws do both - they work as paramedics for a few years while they're in nursing school part-time. This gives them income while they're getting their degree.

**Step 4: Nursing school path (if going RN)**

You have options:

**Associate's Degree in Nursing (ADN)** - 2 years at a community college. Costs $10,000 to $40,000 total, but covered by GI Bill.

**Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)** - 4 years at a university. More expensive but increasingly required by hospitals. Also covered by GI Bill.

**Accelerated BSN programs for people with prior degrees** - If you already have a bachelor's degree in anything, you can do an accelerated BSN in 12-18 months. These are intensive but get you to RN faster.

**LPN-to-RN bridge programs** - If you become a Licensed Practical Nurse first (1 year program), you can work as an LPN (making $50K to $60K) while doing an LPN-to-RN bridge program.

Here's my recommendation for 68Ws: If you can afford to be a full-time student, go straight for your BSN using GI Bill. You'll be an RN in 4 years making $90K+.

If you need income while in school, work as a paramedic or EMT part-time while doing nursing school, or do an LPN program first, work as an LPN, then bridge to RN.

**Step 5: Specialty certifications and advanced practice**

Once you're an RN, you can get specialty certifications:
- Emergency Nursing (CEN certification)
- Critical Care Nursing (CCRN certification)
- Trauma Nursing (TCRN certification)
- Flight Nursing

Each specialty typically pays more than general nursing.

Then if you want to go further, pursue your Nurse Practitioner degree. With NP, you're making $120K to $140K+ and you have prescribing authority.

**GI Bill Strategy:**

Here's how to maximize your GI Bill for healthcare education:

The Post-9/11 GI Bill covers tuition and fees at public colleges up to the state maximum, or up to about $27,000 per year at private schools.

Plus you get a housing allowance while you're a full-time student - currently around $2,355 per month maximum, depending on your school's location.

For a 4-year BSN program, your GI Bill covers:
- All tuition and fees
- Housing allowance for 36 months ($2,355/month = $84,780 total)
- Book stipend ($1,000 per year)

That's over $100,000 in benefits for a degree that will pay you $90,000+ per year for the rest of your career.

That's an incredible return on investment.

**Segment 4: Job Market and Companies Hiring 68Ws (4 minutes)**

The demand for healthcare workers is massive right now and projected to keep growing.

Employment of EMTs and paramedics is projected to grow 5 percent from 2024 to 2034, faster than average. Employment of registered nurses is projected to grow 5 percent from 2024 to 2034 as well.

But the real story is the shortage. There aren't enough healthcare workers to meet demand. This means job security and leverage to negotiate higher pay.

**Where 68Ws are getting hired:**

**As EMTs/Paramedics:**
- AMR (American Medical Response) - largest private ambulance company in the US
- Fire departments in major cities - many require EMT or paramedic certification for firefighter positions
- Hospital emergency departments - some hire EMTs/paramedics for ER tech roles
- Private ambulance companies (there are hundreds of regional companies)
- Event medical services
- Industrial sites (factories, construction sites need on-site medical personnel)

**As Registered Nurses:**
- All major hospital systems (HCA Healthcare, Ascension, CommonSpirit, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, etc.)
- Veterans Affairs hospitals - heavily recruit veterans, preference in hiring
- Military hospitals as civilian nurses
- Urgent care clinics
- Doctor's offices and specialty clinics
- Schools (school nurses)
- Occupational health nursing in corporations
- Travel nursing companies (pay premium rates)

**Companies with veteran hiring programs for healthcare:**

- **Veterans Affairs** - obvious choice, actively recruits veteran nurses
- **HCA Healthcare** - has military hiring initiative
- **AMN Healthcare** - travel nursing, recruits veterans
- **Parallon** - healthcare services, veteran-friendly

**Pro tip for 68Ws:** When applying to jobs, emphasize your trauma experience, your ability to work under pressure, and your experience with diverse patient populations. These are selling points that separate you from other candidates.

**Segment 5: Timeline and Action Plan (3-4 minutes)**

Let me give you two example timelines:

**Timeline 1: 68W to Paramedic (Fast path to earning)**

- **Today**: Research paramedic programs, look for 68W bridge programs
- **6 months**: Apply to paramedic programs, get accepted
- **Months 7-18**: Complete paramedic program while working as EMT part-time if possible
- **Month 19**: Pass National Registry Paramedic exam, get state license
- **Month 20**: Start working as paramedic making $58K to $80K
- **Years 2-5**: Gain experience, potentially pursue flight paramedic or critical care paramedic roles making $70K to $90K+

**Timeline 2: 68W to Registered Nurse (Higher long-term earning)**

- **Today to month 6**: Apply to nursing programs (ADN or BSN), complete prerequisites if needed
- **Months 7-30** (if ADN) or **Months 7-54** (if BSN): Complete nursing degree using GI Bill, work part-time as EMT if needed for income
- **Month 31 or 55**: Pass NCLEX, get RN license
- **Month 32 or 56**: Start working as RN making $90K+
- **Years 3-5**: Specialize (ER, ICU, trauma), pursue certifications
- **Years 5-8**: Consider NP program for $120K to $140K+ career

**My recommendation:**

If you're getting out and you need to start earning immediately: Go the paramedic route. You'll be working and making decent money within 1-2 years.

If you can afford to be a full-time student using GI Bill: Go straight for your BSN. The long-term earning potential ($90K+ as RN, $120K+ as NP) is worth the investment of time.

If you're unsure: Work as an EMT or paramedic for a year while you figure it out. You'll gain civilian healthcare experience and you'll see what nurses do day-to-day, which will help you decide if nursing is the right path.

**[CONCLUSION - 60 seconds]**

Alright, let's recap.

As a 68W, you already have your EMT certification from AIT. That's your baseline. But your experience exceeds EMT scope, so you need to advance to get paid what you're worth.

The career ladder: EMT at $41K median, Paramedic at $58K median, Registered Nurse at $93K median, Nurse Practitioner at $120K to $140K+.

Paramedic is the faster path - 1-2 years and you're working. Nursing is the higher-earning path - 2-4 years for RN but $90K+ salary. You can also work as a paramedic while attending nursing school.

Use your GI Bill to cover paramedic school or nursing school tuition plus housing allowance. Employment is growing 5% and there's a massive healthcare worker shortage, so job security is excellent.
