# Understanding Federal Pay Scales: GS, WG, and SES Explained for Veterans

Federal pay is confusing. GS-12 Step 5, locality pay, within-grade increases, quality step increases—it sounds like a foreign language.

But here's the truth: once you understand how federal pay works, you can strategically target positions that maximize your earning potential. And as a veteran, you have options for coming in at higher grades and steps than typical applicants.

This guide breaks down every federal pay system you'll encounter, shows you exactly what each grade earns, and teaches you how to negotiate the best starting salary.

## The Three Main Federal Pay Systems

### 1. General Schedule (GS)
The most common federal pay system, covering about 1.5 million employees. Used for professional, technical, administrative, and clerical positions.

**Grades:** GS-1 through GS-15
**Steps:** 1 through 10 within each grade
**Locality pay:** Added on top of base pay (varies by location)

### 2. Federal Wage System (WG)
For trade, craft, and labor positions. Pay is based on local prevailing wages for similar private-sector jobs.

**Grades:** WG-1 through WG-15
**Also includes:** WL (Leader) and WS (Supervisor) levels
**Pay varies:** Significantly by geographic location

### 3. Senior Executive Service (SES)
For top-level executives who report to presidential appointees. These are leadership positions across all agencies.

**Pay range:** Currently $147,649 to $221,900 (2024)
**No steps:** Pay is set individually
**Performance-based:** Annual adjustments based on performance

## General Schedule (GS) Pay in Detail

### 2024 GS Base Pay Scale

| Grade | Step 1 | Step 5 | Step 10 |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| GS-1 | $21,986 | $23,296 | $24,879 |
| GS-2 | $24,722 | $25,797 | $27,715 |
| GS-3 | $26,973 | $28,671 | $31,299 |
| GS-4 | $30,280 | $32,411 | $35,652 |
| GS-5 | $33,878 | $36,507 | $40,373 |
| GS-6 | $37,762 | $40,867 | $45,441 |
| GS-7 | $41,966 | $45,612 | $50,885 |
| GS-8 | $46,474 | $50,676 | $56,664 |
| GS-9 | $51,332 | $56,172 | $62,999 |
| GS-10 | $56,528 | $62,044 | $69,730 |
| GS-11 | $62,107 | $68,357 | $77,026 |
| GS-12 | $74,441 | $82,227 | $93,069 |
| GS-13 | $88,520 | $97,917 | $111,111 |
| GS-14 | $104,604 | $115,839 | $131,452 |
| GS-15 | $123,041 | $136,488 | $155,170 |

**Important:** These are BASE salaries. Add locality pay for your actual salary.

### Locality Pay: The Real Game Changer

Federal employees get additional locality pay based on where they work. This can add 17% to 33%+ to your base salary.

**2024 Locality Pay Rates (examples):**

| Location | Locality % | GS-12 Step 5 Total |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Rest of US (base) | 17.06% | $96,257 |
| Atlanta | 23.85% | $101,842 |
| Boston | 30.34% | $107,179 |
| Chicago | 27.25% | $104,598 |
| Dallas-Fort Worth | 25.51% | $103,210 |
| Denver | 28.52% | $105,678 |
| Houston | 33.19% | $109,531 |
| Los Angeles | 33.91% | $110,104 |
| New York | 33.98% | $110,161 |
| San Diego | 30.81% | $107,565 |
| San Francisco | 44.15% | $118,527 |
| Seattle | 30.20% | $107,064 |
| Washington DC | 33.26% | $109,588 |

**San Francisco GS-12 Step 5:** $118,527
**Rest of US GS-12 Step 5:** $96,257
**Difference:** $22,270

Location matters. A lot.

### Understanding Steps and Within-Grade Increases

Each GS grade has 10 steps. You advance through steps based on time and satisfactory performance:

- **Steps 1-3:** 1 year at each step (3 years total)
- **Steps 4-6:** 2 years at each step (6 years total)
- **Steps 7-9:** 3 years at each step (9 years total)
- **Step 10:** Terminal step

**Example progression at GS-12 (DC locality):**
- Year 1: Step 1 = $99,200
- Year 2: Step 2 = $102,506
- Year 3: Step 3 = $105,812
- Year 5: Step 4 = $109,118
- Year 7: Step 5 = $112,424
- Year 9: Step 6 = $115,730
- Year 12: Step 7 = $119,037
- Year 15: Step 8 = $122,343
- Year 18: Step 9 = $125,649
- Year 18+: Step 10 = $128,955

### Quality Step Increases (QSI)

Exceptional performance can earn you an extra step increase (beyond normal progression). QSIs are competitive—only top performers receive them.

### Grade Increases and Career Ladders

Many federal positions are "career ladder" positions, meaning you're hired at a lower grade with promotion potential.

**Example:** A position listed as GS-7/9/11 means:
- You start at GS-7
- After 1 year (with satisfactory performance), promote to GS-9
- After another year, promote to GS-11
- GS-11 is your "full performance level"

**Career ladders are powerful:** You get guaranteed promotions without competing, often with 2-grade increases.

Some common career ladder positions:
- **GS-5/7/9** – Many entry-level professional positions
- **GS-7/9/11** – Specialist and analyst positions
- **GS-9/11/12** – Journey-level professional positions
- **GS-12/13** – Senior specialist positions

## What Your Military Service Qualifies You For

Veterans often ask: "What GS level should I target?"

Here's a rough translation based on military rank:

| Military Rank | Typical GS Equivalent |
|---------------|----------------------|
| E-1 to E-3 | GS-2 to GS-4 |
| E-4 to E-5 | GS-4 to GS-7 |
| E-6 to E-7 | GS-7 to GS-11 |
| E-8 to E-9 | GS-11 to GS-13 |
| O-1 to O-2 | GS-7 to GS-11 |
| O-3 | GS-11 to GS-12 |
| O-4 | GS-12 to GS-13 |
| O-5 | GS-13 to GS-14 |
| O-6 | GS-14 to GS-15 |
| O-7+ | SES |

**Important:** These are rough equivalents. Your actual qualification depends on:
- Specific skills and experience
- Education level
- How well your experience matches the job
- Competition for the position

## Federal Wage System (WG) Pay

The Wage Grade system pays blue-collar workers based on prevailing private-sector wages in their area.

### WG Structure

**Levels:**
- **WG** – Non-supervisory
- **WL** – Leader (works and leads others)
- **WS** – Supervisor

**Grades:** 1-15 (like GS), but pay varies dramatically by location

### Sample WG Pay (varies by location)

| Grade | Typical Starting | Typical Top Step |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| WG-5 | $18-22/hour | $22-26/hour |
| WG-8 | $22-28/hour | $28-34/hour |
| WG-10 | $26-34/hour | $33-42/hour |
| WG-12 | $30-40/hour | $38-50/hour |

### WG Jobs Common for Veterans
- Aircraft mechanic (WG-10 to WG-12)
- Electronics technician (WG-10 to WG-11)
- Heavy equipment operator (WG-8 to WG-10)
- HVAC technician (WG-9 to WG-10)
- Vehicle mechanic (WG-8 to WG-10)
- Warehouse worker (WG-5 to WG-7)
- Electrician (WG-10 to WG-11)
- Machinist (WG-10 to WG-11)

**Key advantage:** WG jobs often have no education requirements—your military technical training counts.

## Senior Executive Service (SES)

SES positions are executive leadership roles—think civilian flag officers.

### SES Pay (2024)

| Level | Salary |
|-------|--------|
| Minimum | $147,649 |
| Maximum (agencies with certification) | $221,900 |
| Maximum (agencies without certification) | $204,000 |

### Veteran Advantages for SES

Veterans have a significant presence in SES:
- Military leadership experience is highly valued
- Strategic planning and large-organization management translates well
- Security clearances often required

### Path to SES

Typical path: GS-12 → GS-13 → GS-14 → GS-15 → SES

Most SES positions require:
- Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs)
- 15+ years of progressively responsible experience
- Advanced education (often Master's or higher)
- Demonstrated executive leadership

## Special Pay Situations

### Special Salary Rates

Some positions in high-demand fields get special salary rates above normal GS pay:

**Common special rate positions:**
- Information Technology (2210 series)
- Engineering
- Medical and healthcare
- Cybersecurity
- Scientific positions

A GS-12 IT Specialist might earn $95,000 base + locality, while a regular GS-12 earns $82,000 base + locality.

### Law Enforcement Pay (LEO)

Law Enforcement Officers get:
- **LEAP (Law Enforcement Availability Pay):** 25% premium for being available for unscheduled duty
- Earlier retirement eligibility
- Enhanced retirement annuity calculation

**Example:** GS-13 Criminal Investigator with LEAP in DC:
- Base + locality: $127,073
- With LEAP (25%): $158,841

### Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO)

Some positions qualify for 10-25% additional pay for unpredictable overtime demands.

### Night and Weekend Differentials

- **Night shift (6 PM - 6 AM):** 10% differential
- **Sunday work:** 25% differential

## How to Negotiate Your Starting Salary

### Superior Qualifications and Special Needs Pay Setting

Agencies can set your pay above Step 1 if you have "superior qualifications" or the agency has a "special need" for your skills.

**How to request:**
1. After receiving a job offer, request a higher step in writing
2. Document your superior qualifications:
   - Certifications
   - Specialized experience
   - Current salary (if higher)
   - Competing job offers
3. Agency must approve—but many do

**Example request:**
> "Based on my 8 years of intelligence analysis experience, current TS/SCI clearance, and PMP certification, I request consideration for GS-12 Step 5 under the Superior Qualifications authority."

### Matching Private Sector Salary

If you're taking a pay cut to join federal service, document your current salary. Agencies can often match higher steps to minimize your pay reduction.

### Using Military Retirement Pay Strategically

Your military retirement pay is **separate** from federal salary—you can receive both.

A retired E-8 with $2,500/month military retirement taking a GS-12 Step 5 position in DC:
- Federal salary: $109,588/year
- Military retirement: $30,000/year
- **Total: $139,588/year**

## Federal Benefits Beyond Salary

Federal compensation is more than just salary:

### Retirement (FERS)
- **Basic Benefit Plan:** 1% of high-3 salary × years of service
- **Thrift Savings Plan:** 5% agency match (essentially free 5%)
- **Social Security:** Yes, federal employees are covered

### Military Service Credit
You can "buy back" your military time to count toward federal retirement. The cost is 3% of your military base pay during those years—usually very worth it.

**Example:**
- 6 years military service
- Military base pay averaged $35,000/year
- Buyback cost: $35,000 × 6 × 3% = $6,300
- **Result:** Those 6 years count toward your FERS pension

### Leave
- **13 days annual leave** to start (increases to 26 days over time)
- **13 days sick leave** (no limit on accumulation)
- **11 paid federal holidays**
- **Credit for military service:** 4+ years of military = start at 19.5 days annual leave

### Health Insurance (FEHB)
The Federal Employees Health Benefits program offers:
- 200+ plan options
- Government pays 72-75% of premiums
- Coverage continues into retirement

### Life Insurance (FEGLI)
- Basic coverage: annual salary + $2,000 (government pays 1/3)
- Optional coverage available
- Can continue into retirement

## Strategic Pay Decisions for Veterans

### When to Accept Lower Starting Pay
- Career ladder position with quick advancement (GS-7 to GS-12 in 3 years)
- High-demand field with rapid promotion (cyber, contracting)
- Desire for stability over maximum pay
- Location has low cost of living but standard locality pay

### When to Push for Higher Pay
- You're taking a significant pay cut from private sector
- You have in-demand certifications (PMP, CISSP, CPA)
- The position is hard to fill
- You have competing offers

### Location Strategy
- **Maximize total compensation:** DC area has high locality pay AND many positions
- **Maximize purchasing power:** Low cost areas with "Rest of US" locality
- **Balance:** Cities like Denver, Atlanta, or Austin with moderate locality and reasonable cost

## The Bottom Line

Federal pay might seem complicated, but the system is transparent—unlike private sector negotiation, you know exactly what every position pays.

**Key takeaways:**
1. **GS-11 to GS-13** is where most veterans with 4-10 years of service will qualify
2. **Locality pay adds 17-44%** to your base salary—location matters
3. **Career ladder positions** offer guaranteed promotions
4. **Military retirement plus federal salary** is a powerful combination
5. **Negotiate for higher steps** using Superior Qualifications authority
6. **Buy back your military time** for your FERS pension

Understanding federal pay gives you the power to target the right positions and negotiate effectively.
