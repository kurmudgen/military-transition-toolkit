# Utah Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Utah offers one of the nation's most generous property tax exemptions for disabled veterans: up to $521,620 in assessed value reduction for 2025. This percentage-based system means a 100% disabled veteran with a $500,000 home in Salt Lake County saves approximately $3,000 annually, while even a 30% disabled veteran saves around $900. The exemption scales with your disability rating, starting at 10%.

Military retirement income became fully exempt from Utah state income tax starting in 2021, saving retirees an average of $1,315 annually. Combined with the flat 4.50% state income tax rate (down from 4.55% in 2024), Utah ranks in the top 15 states nationally for overall veteran tax benefits.

The property tax exemption is significantly better than most neighboring states—larger dollar amounts than Colorado ($200K exemption cap) and more accessible than Arizona's strict income limits. A 100% disabled veteran in Utah with $50,000 military retirement income and a $500,000 home saves approximately $5,250 annually compared to living in a state that taxes military retirement and offers no property tax exemption.

Downsides? The $521,620 exemption is a fixed amount that doesn't increase with home values above that level, so if you own a $1 million home, you're only getting relief on the first $521,620. Also, you must choose between applying the exemption to real property or vehicles—not both.

Overall verdict: Utah is a top-tier state for veteran taxes, especially for disabled veterans with ratings of 30% or higher. The combination of military retirement tax exemption and substantial property tax relief makes it financially attractive for retirement.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Exemptions by Disability Rating

**100% Disabled Veterans:**
- Exemption amount: $521,620 assessed value (2025)
- Annual tax savings: $2,600-$3,500 depending on county
- Requirements: 10-100% service-connected disability from VA; must be Utah resident with honorable discharge
- Scales with disability rating: 100% rating = 100% of exemption amount

If you're 100% service-connected disabled, you'll save $2,600-$3,500 annually on property taxes in most Utah counties. This exemption applies to the assessed value, not the market value, and Utah's 55% assessment rate means you get substantial savings.

**Example:** A 100% disabled veteran with a $500,000 home in Salt Lake County:
- Assessed value: $275,000 (55% of market value)
- Exemption reduces assessed value by: $521,620 (full home is covered)
- Property tax rate: ~1.15% (Salt Lake County average)
- Tax without exemption: $3,163
- Tax with exemption: $0 (fully covered)
- **Annual savings: $3,163**

**80% Disabled:**
- Exemption amount: $417,296 assessed value (80% of $521,620)
- Annual tax savings: $2,080-$2,800
- Requirements: 80% service-connected disability rating

This tier covers veterans rated exactly 80% by the VA. You'll save over $2,000 annually—meaningful relief that's better than most states offer.

**50% Disabled:**
- Exemption amount: $260,810 assessed value (50% of $521,620)
- Annual tax savings: $1,300-$1,750
- Requirements: 50% service-connected disability rating

Even at 50% disabled, you're saving $1,300+ per year. This is considerably better than states like Nevada ($948 for 80-99%) or Colorado (which requires 100% disability).

**30% Disabled:**
- Exemption amount: $156,486 assessed value (30% of $521,620)
- Annual tax savings: $780-$1,050
- Requirements: 30% service-connected disability rating

Utah's low barrier to entry (10% minimum) means more veterans qualify than in states requiring 50% or 100% disability.

**Under 30% / 10-20% Disabled:**
- Exemption amount: $52,162-$104,324 assessed value (10-20% of $521,620)
- Annual savings: $260-$600
- Requirements: 10-20% service-connected disability rating

Even veterans with minimal disability ratings get some relief—unique compared to many states.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your county assessor's office** (deadline: September 1 annually)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4) showing honorable discharge
   - VA award letter showing disability percentage
   - Proof of Utah residency (driver's license, utility bill)
   - Property deed or vehicle registration

3. **Choose where to apply the exemption:**
   - Real property (your house)
   - Tangible personal property (vehicle)
   - You can only apply it to one—whichever saves you more

**Application Timeline:**
- File by September 1 of the current year
- Processing: 30-60 days
- Effective: Current tax year

**Example:** If you own a home worth $450,000 in Provo and are 70% disabled, you'll save about $2,205 in annual property taxes. If you instead apply the exemption to your vehicle, savings depend on vehicle value and county rates.

### Property Tax by County

Utah property tax rates vary significantly by county. Here's how major counties compare:

| County | Average Effective Rate | Median Home Value | Annual Tax (Non-Exempt) | Savings (100% Disabled) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Salt Lake | 1.15% | $585,000 | $3,163 | $3,163 (full exemption) |
| Utah (Provo) | 1.08% | $500,000 | $2,970 | $2,970 (full exemption) |
| Davis | 1.13% | $525,000 | $3,250 | $3,250 (full exemption) |
| Weber (Ogden) | 1.18% | $387,000 | $2,509 | $2,509 (full exemption) |
| Washington (St. George) | 1.02% | $530,000 | $2,969 | $2,969 (full exemption) |

**Note:** Utah uses a 55% assessment rate, meaning assessed value = 55% of market value. The exemption of $521,620 applies to assessed value, so it covers homes with market values up to approximately $948,400. For homes above this value, only a portion receives exemption.

**Tax rate caps:** Utah law limits annual property tax increases for senior citizens and low-income homeowners, though veterans don't receive additional caps beyond the exemption.

### Real Property vs. Vehicle Tax

You must choose whether to apply your veteran exemption to real property (home) or tangible personal property (vehicle). Here's how to decide:

**Apply to real property if:**
- You own a home
- Your property tax bill exceeds what you'd pay on a vehicle
- You're a homeowner (most common choice)

**Apply to vehicle property tax if:**
- You don't own property
- You have an expensive vehicle (RV, luxury car, boat)
- You're renting

**Example:**
- 100% disabled veteran with $500,000 home in Salt Lake City: Property tax = $3,163. Veteran exemption saves $3,163.
- Same veteran with $50,000 truck: Vehicle property tax = ~$500. Exemption saves ~$500.
- Apply to property tax for maximum savings.

**Purple Heart Recipients - Vehicle Registration Exemption:**
Purple Heart recipients receive an additional benefit: exemption from motor vehicle license and registration fees (excluding property taxes and age-based fees). This is separate from the property tax exemption and can be combined.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—Utah fully exempts military retirement income**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $1,315 average (varies by income level)

Utah enacted Senate Bill 11 in March 2021, creating a nonrefundable income tax credit that effectively eliminates state tax on military retirement pay, including survivor benefits. This applies retroactively to January 1, 2021.

**How it works:**
- Military retirement is technically included in gross income on your Utah return
- You claim the Military Retirement Credit, which offsets 100% of state tax owed on that income
- The credit cannot exceed your total tax liability (non-refundable)
- You cannot claim both the Military Retirement Credit AND the general Retirement Credit on the same return

**Example savings:**
- O-5 retiree with $60,000 annual pension:
  - Without exemption at 4.50% rate: $2,700 state tax
  - With Utah exemption: $0
  - **Annual savings: $2,700**

- E-7 retiree with $40,000 pension:
  - Without exemption: $1,800 state tax
  - With Utah exemption: $0
  - **Annual savings: $1,800**

If you're a military retiree moving to Utah, you'll save $1,000-$3,000+ annually compared to states that tax military retirement.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt (federally and in all states)
- Utah: Not taxed (already federally exempt)

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere. Whether you receive $165/month for a 10% rating or $4,000+/month for 100% with dependents, you won't pay federal or state taxes on it.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Utah taxation: $0 (covered under military retirement exemption)
- Federal: Taxed at federal level

Surviving spouses receiving Survivor Benefit Plan payments qualify for Utah's military retirement income tax credit. They do pay federal tax, but that applies everywhere.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Subject to Utah income tax (4.50% flat rate)
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; Utah follows federal treatment
- **Active duty pay:** Subject to Utah tax unless you maintain out-of-state residency under SCRA

If you're active duty stationed at Hill Air Force Base but claim residency in another state, Utah doesn't tax your military income.

## State Tax Rates

Utah operates on a flat income tax system:

- **Flat rate:** 4.50% on all taxable income (reduced from 4.55% in 2024, effective January 1, 2025)

This is comparable to Arizona (2.5%) and significantly lower than California (top rate 13.3%), though higher than states with no income tax (Nevada, Texas, Florida, Washington).

**Standard deduction:** Utah follows federal amounts - $13,850 (single), $27,700 (married) for 2025.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement | Income Tax Rate | Property Tax Exemption (100%) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Utah** | Fully exempt | 4.50% flat | $521,620 assessed value |
| Nevada | N/A | No income tax | $35,400 assessed value |
| Arizona | Fully exempt | 2.5% flat | $3,671 value reduction |
| Colorado | Partial ($15K-$24K age-based) | 4.40% flat | 50% of first $200K |
| Idaho | Partial ($41K max) | Up to 5.8% | $2,500 |
| Wyoming | N/A | No income tax | No veteran exemption |

Utah sits in the top tier for combined benefits—military retirement fully exempt AND one of the nation's highest property tax exemptions.

## Vehicle Registration & Sales Tax Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: $15 one-time fee, no renewal fees
- Requirements: Service-connected disability (any percentage)
- Documentation: DD-214 or VA form 20-5455

Disabled veteran license plates have a one-time $15 fee with no renewal fees, saving $50-$100 annually compared to standard registration.

**Purple Heart Recipients - Registration Fee Exemption:**
- Exemption: Motor vehicle license and registration fees (excluding property taxes and age-based fees)
- Requirements: Purple Heart award documentation
- Annual savings: $50-$150

This exemption is separate from the property tax exemption and significantly valuable.

**Sales Tax Exemption for 100% Disabled Veterans:**
Utah offers a sales tax exemption on **one vehicle purchase** for veterans with a 100% service-connected disability rating.

- **Eligibility:** 100% service-connected disability
- **Benefit:** Exemption from sales tax on one vehicle purchase
- **Savings:** On a $40,000 vehicle with 6.25% sales tax: $2,500 savings (one-time)

This is a significant benefit not offered by many states. Utah's sales tax rate ranges from 4.7% to 8.7% depending on jurisdiction, so savings on a vehicle purchase can be $2,000-$3,500.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | Property Tax Exemption | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $50K Retirement) |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Utah** | Exempt | $521,620 assessed value | $5,463 |
| Nevada | N/A (no income tax) | $35,400 assessed value | $6,464 (baseline: no income tax state) |
| Arizona | Exempt | $3,671 value reduction | $4,150 |
| Colorado | Partial (age-based) | 50% of first $200K | $3,500 |
| Idaho | Partial | $2,500 | $2,800 |
| Wyoming | N/A (no income tax) | No exemption | $1,500 (no exemption hurts) |

**Verdict:** Utah ranks #2 among neighboring states for overall tax savings, behind only Nevada (which has no income tax). Utah's property tax exemption is significantly more generous than Arizona, Colorado, and Idaho.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** Top tier—Utah fully exempts military retirement income as of 2021
- **Property tax exemption:** Top 5 nationally—$521,620 is among the highest exemptions in the country
- **Overall ranking:** **Top 10 nationally** for veteran tax benefits

Studies by Veterans United and Military Times consistently rank Utah in the top 10-15 states for military retirees and disabled veterans based on tax benefits and quality of life.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- Disabled veterans rated 30% or higher (property tax exemption is substantial)
- Military retirees with pensions over $30,000 (full exemption saves $1,350+)
- 100% disabled veterans (combined savings of $5,000+ annually)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (California, New York, Oregon)
- Homeowners in Salt Lake, Davis, or Utah counties (highest property tax rates = biggest savings)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans with low or no disability rating (property tax exemption requires 10% minimum)
- Veterans rated under 30% (property tax savings are modest)
- Non-homeowners (can't take full advantage of property tax exemption)

**Better options:**
- If you want zero income tax overall, consider Nevada, Texas, or Florida (though Utah's exemption effectively eliminates military retirement tax)
- If you want lower cost of living, consider Idaho (though tax benefits are inferior)

## Additional Financial Benefits

### First-Time Homebuyer Grant

Utah offers a **$2,500 grant** for eligible veterans and service members purchasing their first home in Utah.

**Eligibility:**
- Recently separated veteran (within last 5 years) OR currently serving (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard)
- First-time homebuyers in Utah (haven't owned home in Utah in past 7 years)
- Eligible for VA Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility
- Home must be primary residence, occupied within 30 days of closing

**How it works:**
- $2,500 grant (does not require repayment)
- Funds can be used for down payment, closing costs, or any purpose
- Can use any conforming mortgage type (VA, FHA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)
- Subject to funding availability

This stacks with the property tax exemption and military retirement exemption for significant total value.

### Hunting and Fishing Licenses

Utah offers discounted hunting and fishing licenses for disabled veterans:

**Veterans with 20%+ Service-Connected Disability:**
- **Hunting license:** $25.50 (vs. $34 full price)
- **Combination license:** $28.50 (vs. $38 full price)
- **Fishing license:** $12 (discounted)
- **Annual savings:** $25-$50

**Application:** Submit VA documentation showing 20% or higher disability rating to Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. Once approved, automatic renewal eligibility with $10 annual renewal fee.

### State Parks

Utah has not yet implemented a statewide free or discounted state parks pass for veterans, though legislation has been proposed. However, Utah has:

- 5 national parks (Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef)
- 44 state parks
- 9 national monuments
- Federal Access Pass available for veterans with permanent disabilities: Free lifetime pass to national parks and federal lands

### Veteran State Cemetery

**Utah Veterans Cemetery and Memorial Park** (Bluffdale)
- Location: Just north of Camp Williams
- Eligibility: Veterans, spouses, dependent children
- Burial cost: Free for veterans, nominal fee for spouses and dependents
- Services: In-ground casket, urn burials, columbarium niche
- Included: Headstones, markers, U.S. flag, military funeral honors

This represents savings of $5,000-$10,000+ compared to private cemetery burial.

### Sales Tax

Utah does not offer general sales tax exemptions for veterans (except the one-time vehicle purchase exemption for 100% disabled). Combined state and local sales tax ranges from 4.7% to 8.7% depending on jurisdiction.

## Financial Impact Analysis

Let's calculate the lifetime financial impact for a 100% disabled veteran retiring in Utah vs. other states.

### Scenario: E-7 Retiree, 20 Years Service, 100% Disabled, Age 42

**Home:** $500,000 (median for Salt Lake County)
**Vehicle:** $40,000

### Utah Savings Over 30 Years (Age 42-72)

| First-time homebuyer grant (one-time) | N/A | $2,500 |
| **TOTAL** | **~$5,043/year** | **$156,290** |

**Additional costs to consider:**
- Utah income tax on non-military income (if applicable): $0 (VA disability is tax-exempt)
- Property tax on home value above $948,400 market value: Only applies to luxury homes

### Comparison: Utah vs. States with No Benefits

| Benefit | Utah | No-Benefit State | Savings Over 30 Years |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Military retirement tax | $0 | $54,000 (at 4.5% rate) | $54,000 |
| Property tax exemption | $94,890 | $0 | $94,890 |
| Vehicle/misc. | $4,900 | $0 | $4,900 |
| **TOTAL 30-YEAR SAVINGS** | **$153,790** | **$0** | **$153,790** |

Moving to Utah vs. a state with no veteran tax benefits saves over $150,000 in 30 years—life-changing wealth.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I pay state income tax on my military retirement in Utah?**

A: No. Utah enacted a full exemption for military retirement income in 2021. You'll claim the Military Retirement Credit on your state tax return, which eliminates state tax on retirement pay. You still pay federal income tax.

**Q: Can I apply my property tax exemption to more than one property?**

A: No. The exemption applies to your primary residence only, not investment properties or vacation homes.

**Q: Can I apply the exemption to both my house and my car?**

A: No. You must choose one: real property or tangible personal property (vehicle). Choose whichever saves you more money. For most homeowners, real property yields greater savings.

**Q: How much does the 100% disabled veteran property tax exemption save me?**

A: In Salt Lake County with a $500,000 home: approximately $3,163 annually. The exact savings depend on your county's tax rate and your home's value. The exemption covers assessed value up to $521,620, which equates to market values up to ~$948,400.

**Q: I'm 40% disabled. Do I qualify for a property tax exemption?**

A: Yes. You receive 40% of the maximum exemption ($521,620 x 40% = $208,648), saving approximately $1,265-$1,900 annually depending on your county.

**Q: Do I need to reapply for the property tax exemption every year?**

A: It depends on your county. Some counties require annual reapplication; others grant automatic renewal. Check with your county assessor's office.

**Q: What if I'm rated 90% or 70%?**

You qualify for a prorated exemption:
- 90% disabled: $469,458 exemption (~$2,847 annual savings in Salt Lake County)
- 70% disabled: $365,134 exemption (~$2,214 annual savings)

This prorated system is more generous than states requiring 100% disability for any exemption.

**Q: Does TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) count as 100%?**

A: Yes. Veterans with TDIU status qualify for the full exemption amount, just like veterans rated 100% P&T.

**Q: Are military retirement benefits taxed if I move to Utah from another state?**

A: No. Once you establish Utah residency, your military retirement income is fully exempt from Utah state income tax. This applies regardless of where you served or previously lived.

**Q: Do I need to be retired from the military to get these benefits?**

- **Property tax exemption:** No, only need VA disability rating of 10%+
- **Income tax exemption on military retirement:** Yes, must be receiving military retirement pay
- **Disabled veteran plates:** No, only need service-connected disability documentation
- **Hunting/fishing discount:** No, only need 20%+ disability rating
- **First-time homebuyer grant:** No, active duty, Guard, and Reserve are eligible

**Q: What if my county denies my exemption application?**

Contact:
- **Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs:** (801) 326-2372 | veterans@utah.gov
- County assessor's office (request appeals process)
- County Veteran Service Officers: Available in each Utah county

**Q: Does Utah tax my TSP or 401(k) withdrawals?**

Yes, at Utah's 4.50% flat rate. Qualified retirement account withdrawals (other than military retirement pension) are taxed as regular income. However, Social Security benefits are not taxed by Utah.

**Q: Will these benefits affect my federal taxes?**

No. Property tax exemptions and state income tax exemptions don't impact your federal tax liability. Military retirement and VA disability compensation have the same federal tax treatment regardless of state.

**Q: What happens if I sell my home and buy another in Utah?**

You'll need to reapply for the exemption at your new property. File by September 1 to ensure coverage for that tax year.

**Q: Can I claim the exemption on a second home or rental property?**

No. The exemption applies only to your **primary residence** where you live. Investment properties don't qualify.

**Q: I'm a Purple Heart recipient. What benefits do I get?**

- Exemption from motor vehicle registration fees (excluding property taxes and age-based fees)
- Can still claim property tax exemption if you have a VA disability rating
- Disabled veteran license plates with $15 one-time fee

**Q: Can I get both the disabled veteran property tax exemption and the Purple Heart registration exemption?**

Yes. They're separate benefits. You can claim the property tax exemption (based on VA disability rating) AND the registration fee exemption (based on Purple Heart award).

**Q: How does Utah's $521,620 exemption compare to other states?**

Utah's exemption is among the top 5 nationally:
- Oklahoma: Full exemption for 100% disabled (best)
- Texas: $12,000-$24,000 exemption
- Florida: Full exemption for 10%+ disabled combat veterans (Florida resident for 1 year)
- **Utah: $521,620** (top tier, scales with disability rating)
- Arizona: $3,671 (much less generous, though income limits are strict)

Utah's system is better than 90% of states.

**Q: What's the best time to move to Utah for tax purposes?**

Move by September 1 to ensure you can file for property tax exemption for that year. Establish residency (Utah driver's license, voter registration) immediately. If you move later in the year, you'll need to wait until the following year to claim the exemption.

## Key Takeaways

Utah delivers **exceptional** financial value for veterans:

1. **Disabled veterans** (30%+ rating) save $2,000-$5,500 annually through combined benefits
2. **Military retirees** save $1,315-$2,700 annually with full income tax exemption
3. **100% disabled veterans** save over $5,000 per year—$150,000+ over 30 years
4. **Property tax exemption scales with disability rating** from 10%-100%, one of the most inclusive systems nationally
5. **No annual income tax on military retirement** as of 2021—major advantage
6. **Purple Heart recipients** get additional registration fee exemptions

**Utah's real benefits:**
- Top 5 nationally for property tax exemption ($521,620)
- Full military retirement income exemption (saves $1,315 average)
- Low 4.50% flat income tax rate (down from 4.55% in 2024)
- Outstanding outdoor recreation (5 national parks, world-class skiing)
- Strong military community and Hill Air Force Base employment
- $2,500 first-time homebuyer grant for veterans

**Choose Utah for:** Property tax savings, military retirement tax exemption, outdoor lifestyle, moderate cost of living, strong job market (Hill AFB area)

**Don't choose Utah for:** Zero income tax (Nevada, Texas, Florida are better), beach lifestyle, warm winters

If you're a disabled veteran (30%+) or military retiree and haven't applied for Utah's property tax exemption, file by September 1. Combined with the military retirement exemption, you'll save $2,000-$5,000+ annually—life-changing financial relief that makes Utah one of the best states in America for veterans.
