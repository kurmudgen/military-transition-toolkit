## Common Transition Challenges

### Challenge 1: "But I just cooked in the Army"
**Reality**: You managed large-scale operations, led teams, controlled inventory, and maintained standards. That's food service management.

**Solution**: Learn to articulate your management and leadership experience, not just cooking.

### Challenge 2: Starting at the Bottom
**Reality**: Some 92Gs have to start as line cooks to prove themselves in civilian kitchens.

**Solution**: Target institutional food service (hospitals, schools, corporate) where your scale experience is immediately valued. Or target management trainee programs with contract companies.

### Challenge 3: Different Kitchen Culture
**Reality**: Civilian kitchens can be less structured than military DFACs.

**Solution**: Your discipline and standards are assets. Show adaptability while maintaining your work ethic.

### Challenge 4: Lower Starting Pay Than Expected
**Reality**: Entry-level civilian food service pays less than you'd hope.

**Solution**: Look at career trajectory. Entry-level positions lead to management. Institutional food service often pays better with benefits than restaurant entry-level.
