## Bottom Line Up Front

Army 35L Counterintelligence Agents transitioning out—you're one of the most sought-after intelligence professionals in both government and private sectors. Your **counterintelligence investigations, source operations, threat assessments, security evaluations, polygraph experience, advanced interview techniques, and ability to identify insider threats and foreign intelligence activities** make you extremely valuable. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$85,000-$120,000** with federal law enforcement (FBI, DSS, NCIS) or entry-level security positions, scaling to **$130,000-$175,000** with mid-career federal agent positions or corporate counterintelligence roles, and **$175,000-$220,000+** for senior security leadership or specialized CI positions. Your TS/SCI clearance with CI polygraph is worth **$25,000-$50,000** in salary premium and opens doors others can't access.

As a 35L, you didn't just "conduct investigations." You conducted counterintelligence investigations into espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and insider threats. You recruited and managed human sources. You conducted security assessments of facilities and operations. You performed counterintelligence support to force protection. You advised commanders on CI threats and vulnerabilities. You conducted surveillance and counter-surveillance. You liaised with FBI, CIA, DSS, and allied CI services. That's law enforcement investigation, human intelligence operations, security expertise, and strategic threat assessment—all directly applicable to federal agent careers, corporate security, and counterintelligence positions.

The key advantage: 35L experience is the closest military equivalent to FBI Special Agent or CIA Protective Security roles. Your investigative training, source handling, and CI mission align perfectly with federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. FBI actively recruits 35Ls. CIA Ground Branch, Special Activities Center, and Protective Security want 35L backgrounds. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), NCIS, OSI, DCSA, and corporate security all need your counterintelligence expertise.

## What Does a 35L Counterintelligence Agent Do?

As a 35L, you conducted counterintelligence investigations and operations to detect, identify, assess, counter, exploit, and neutralize threats from foreign intelligence services, international terrorists, and insider threats. You conducted CI investigations of espionage, sabotage, terrorism, unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and serious security violations. You recruited, vetted, and managed human intelligence sources for CI purposes. You conducted security assessments, threat briefings, and force protection operations.

Your responsibilities included conducting CI interviews and interrogations, performing surveillance and counter-surveillance operations, conducting security vulnerability assessments, analyzing CI information and producing CI reports, coordinating with federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies (FBI, CIA, DSS), advising commanders on insider threat and security issues, and supporting sensitive site exploitation and detainee operations.

This role required investigative skills, interviewing expertise, source handling capabilities, surveillance proficiency, critical thinking under pressure, writing and briefing skills, understanding of CI methodologies, knowledge of federal law enforcement procedures, and absolute trustworthiness with sensitive operations and classified information.

## Top Civilian Career Paths for 35L Counterintelligence Agents

### Federal Law Enforcement (FBI, DSS, NCIS, OSI) (closest mission alignment)

**Civilian job titles:**
- FBI Special Agent
- Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Special Agent
- Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Special Agent
- Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) Special Agent
- Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Investigator
- DEA Special Agent
- ATF Special Agent
- US Marshals Deputy Marshal

**Salary ranges:**
- **FBI Special Agent (GS-10 start):** $78,000-$105,000 + 25% LEAP = $97,000-$131,000 total
- **DSS Special Agent (FP-6):** Starting $103,000-$182,000 (depending on step), avg $132,000
- **NCIS Special Agent (GS-11 to GS-13):** $80,000-$115,000 + 25% = $100,000-$144,000
- **OSI Special Agent (GS-11 to GS-13):** Similar to NCIS
- **DEA Special Agent:** $70,000-$105,000 + 25% LEAP = $87,500-$131,000
- **Senior Special Agent (GS-14/GS-15):** $120,000-$165,000+ with locality and LEAP

**What translates directly:**
- CI investigations and methodologies
- Source operations and confidential informant handling
- Interviewing and interrogation techniques
- Report writing and evidence documentation
- Interagency coordination (you've already worked with FBI/CIA)
- Security clearance and polygraph experience
- Surveillance operations
- Threat assessment and analysis

**Certifications needed:**
- **Bachelor's degree** (required for FBI, DEA, DSS—use GI Bill if you don't have one)
- **TS/SCI clearance** (you have this—massive advantage)
- **Valid driver's license**
- **Physical fitness** (you'll pass easily)
- **Federal agency training** (provided after hiring—FBI is 21 weeks at Quantico)

**Reality check:**
Your 35L background is EXACTLY what FBI, DSS, and other federal agencies want. You're not learning a new career—you're continuing the same mission under a different badge.

**FBI:** Application to hiring takes 12-18 months. Age limit is 37 (some exceptions for veterans). Your 35L experience, clearance, and military service make you highly competitive. Many 35Ls become FBI Special Agents—it's the most common transition path.

**DSS:** Diplomatic Security Special Agents protect diplomatic personnel and facilities worldwide. Your CI background, source operations, and threat assessment skills translate directly. DSS values 35L experience. Hiring process is 8-12 months.

**NCIS/OSI:** Military criminal investigative services value 35L experience. You understand military culture and have relevant investigative skills. Hiring is faster than FBI (6-12 months).

**DCSA:** Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency conducts background investigations and CI operations. Actively hires 35Ls. Less competitive than FBI but solid federal career with CI mission focus.

Age caps vary by agency—FBI is strictest (37), others more flexible. Start applications 18-24 months before separation.

**Best for:** 35L agents who want to continue law enforcement/CI mission, prefer federal stability and benefits, and want badge-and-gun authority.

### CIA & Intelligence Community Operations (covert operations, strategic CI)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Protective Security Officer (CIA)
- Ground Branch Operator (CIA Special Activities Center)
- Counterintelligence Officer (CIA)
- Operations Officer (CIA Directorate of Operations)
- Security Protective Officer (various IC agencies)
- CI Analyst (DIA, NSA, NGA)

**Salary ranges:**
- **CIA Operations Officer (GS-10 to GS-15):** $70,000-$160,000+ (plus overseas allowances, danger pay)
- **CIA Protective Security:** $90,000-$145,000+
- **CIA Ground Branch:** $150,000-$250,000+ (high-risk overseas operations)
- **DIA Counterintelligence:** $85,000-$155,000

**What translates directly:**
Everything. CIA wants 35L backgrounds—your CI training, source operations, threat assessment, and operational experience are exactly what they need.

**Reality check:**
CIA hiring is lengthy (12-24 months) and opaque. They want people with operational experience, language skills, willingness to operate overseas, and ability to handle sensitive unilateral operations. Your 35L background checks all boxes.

Ground Branch recruits Tier 1/2 operators for covert direct action, but they also value 35L backgrounds for CI support operations. Protective Security protects CIA personnel and facilities—similar to DSS but for CIA operations.

Not all CIA positions are covert. Many are analytical or support roles with normal work-life balance. Operations Officer and Ground Branch positions require extensive overseas work, often in high-threat environments.

Polygraph is intensive—full-scope lifestyle polygraph covering everything. Be completely honest. Any deception disqualifies you permanently.

**Best for:** 35L agents who want to continue intelligence operations at strategic level, are willing to work overseas extensively, and want to operate at the intersection of intelligence and security.

### Corporate Counterintelligence & Insider Threat Programs (private sector, higher pay ceiling)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Corporate Counterintelligence Analyst
- Insider Threat Program Manager
- Security Investigations Manager
- Corporate Security Analyst
- Threat Intelligence Manager
- Competitive Intelligence Analyst (ethical business intelligence)
- Director of Corporate Security

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level CI Analyst:** $85,000-$110,000
- **Mid-level CI Manager:** $110,000-$150,000
- **Senior CI/Insider Threat Manager:** $150,000-$200,000
- **Director of Security:** $180,000-$280,000+

**What translates directly:**
- Insider threat detection and prevention
- Security investigations and case management
- Threat assessment and risk analysis
- Source operations translate to corporate HUMINT (competitive intelligence)
- Security briefings and executive advisory

**Companies hiring:**
- **Tech companies** (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta—protecting IP, detecting espionage)
- **Defense contractors** (Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Raytheon—protecting classified programs)
- **Financial institutions** (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi—insider trading, fraud detection)
- **Pharmaceutical companies** (Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson—protecting drug research)
- **Energy companies** (ExxonMobil, Chevron—infrastructure protection)
- **Consulting firms** (Deloitte, PwC—risk advisory practices)

**Reality check:**
Corporate CI is different from military/government CI. You're protecting corporate assets—intellectual property, trade secrets, proprietary information—from competitors, foreign governments, and insiders. The threats are similar (espionage, insider threats) but the context is business.

Salaries are higher than government, especially at senior levels. Work-life balance is typically better. The mission feels less impactful—you're protecting corporate profits, not national security. However, the threats are real—nation-states conduct economic espionage, competitors steal IP, insiders commit fraud.

Some roles require clearances (defense contractors), others don't (most corporate positions). Your clearance is a differentiator for cleared corporate roles but less relevant for non-cleared commercial positions.

**Best for:** 35L agents who want private sector pay, better work-life balance, and are comfortable protecting corporate interests rather than national security.

### Defense Contractor Security & CI Support (high pay, familiar mission)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Counterintelligence Analyst
- Security Specialist
- CI Investigations Support
- Insider Threat Analyst
- Force Protection Analyst
- Security Operations Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level (0-3 years):** $85,000-$110,000
- **Mid-career (3-7 years):** $110,000-$145,000
- **Senior-level (7-12+ years):** $145,000-$180,000
- **Principal/Lead (12+ years):** $180,000-$220,000+

**What translates directly:**
Everything. You're doing the exact same CI work as a contractor that you did as a 35L, supporting government customers.

**Companies hiring:**
- **CACI International** (CI and security support)
- **Booz Allen Hamilton**
- **Leidos**
- **BAE Systems**
- **Peraton**
- **SAIC**
- **General Dynamics IT**
- **ManTech**
- **Parsons**
- **Amentum**

**Reality check:**
Defense CI contractors support military units, government agencies, and programs with CI services. You might work at military installations providing CI support, conduct security assessments for programs, or support CI operations for agencies.

The work is nearly identical to active duty 35L work, but you're paid 30-50% more. Contracts typically last 3-5 years with options to extend. If contracts end, you job hunt, but the cleared CI market is strong.

Most positions require active TS/SCI with CI poly. Your clearance and recent CI experience make you immediately hire-able.

**Best for:** 35L agents who want maximum salary while continuing CI mission, don't mind contract employment, and prefer working in familiar military/government environments.

### Executive Protection & Corporate Security (high-profile security)

**Civilian job titles:**
- Executive Protection Specialist
- Corporate Security Manager
- Security Director
- Close Protection Officer
- Protective Intelligence Analyst
- Threat Assessment Manager

**Salary ranges:**
- **Entry-level EP Agent:** $70,000-$95,000
- **Experienced EP Specialist:** $95,000-$140,000
- **High Net Worth EP Manager:** $140,000-$200,000
- **Director of Security (Fortune 500):** $180,000-$280,000+
- **Day-rate contract EP:** $600-$1,200/day

**What translates directly:**
- Threat assessment and protective intelligence (your CI threat assessment skills)
- Surveillance and counter-surveillance
- Source operations translate to protective intelligence networks
- Security planning and operations
- Executive advisory and risk communication

**Reality check:**
Executive protection combines security operations with threat intelligence. Your CI background provides a unique advantage—you understand adversary TTPs, can conduct protective intelligence, and know how to assess threats.

Entry-level EP is physical security—standing post, driving clients, low-profile protection. Mid-career EP involves travel, advance work, threat intelligence. Senior EP manages security programs for executives or high-net-worth families.

Corporate Director of Security roles oversee entire corporate security programs—physical security, investigations, insider threat, executive protection, crisis management. These are strategic leadership positions paying $180K-$280K+.

**Best for:** 35L agents interested in protective operations, comfortable with client service, and willing to start at entry-level to reach premium positions.

- Start bachelor's degree if you don't have one (required for FBI/federal)
- Document your clearance level, investigation date, and CI poly
- Request 10 certified copies of DD-214
- Create LinkedIn profile emphasizing "Counterintelligence Agent" and "Special Agent"

**12-18 Months Out:**
- Continue federal applications (expect multiple rounds of testing, interviews, polygraph)
- Register on ClearanceJobs.com (primary cleared job board)
- Network with former 35Ls—many are now FBI/DSS/CIA
- Research corporate security roles at Fortune 500 companies
- Consider CPP certification (security professional standard)

**6-12 Months Out:**
- Apply to defense contractors (30-50 positions on ClearanceJobs)
- Prepare for FBI/federal interviews (behavioral questions, scenario-based)
- Practice polygraph prep (be honest, don't overthink)
- Consider SkillBridge internship with FBI, contractor, or corporate security
- Finalize education (bachelor's degree completion)

**3-6 Months Out:**
- Aggressive applications (FBI, DSS, NCIS, contractors, corporate)
- Interview preparation—practice "tell me about a time you..." questions
- Prepare for relocation (most jobs in DC area)
- Get CPP or executive protection training if pursuing those paths
- Network at security conferences (ASIS, AFIO)

**After Separation:**
- If no job yet, accept temporary cleared contractor work to keep clearance active
- Continue federal applications (FBI can take 18+ months—stay patient)
- Network aggressively—many CI jobs come through connections
- Consider corporate security interim roles while federal processes continue

**Action Items This Week:**
1. Go to FBI.gov/jobs and start application (DO THIS FIRST—takes 18 months)
2. Apply to DSS at careers.state.gov
3. Document all your CI investigations, source operations, and operational experience
4. Connect with 30+ former 35Ls on LinkedIn
5. Register on ClearanceJobs.com and set up alerts for "counterintelligence"

**Your 35L training and experience are incredibly valuable. Federal agencies actively want you. Corporate America needs your insider threat expertise. Defense contractors can't hire 35Ls fast enough. Start early—especially FBI applications—maintain your clearance, and target strategic opportunities. You've conducted real-world CI operations. That's worth six figures. Know your value and negotiate accordingly.**
