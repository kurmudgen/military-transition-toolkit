# Military Spouse Preference Hiring: How It Actually Works

## Bottom Line Up Front

Military spouse preference (MSP) is a **real hiring advantage** for federal and DoD positions—but only if you understand how to use it. MSP applies to **DoD civilian positions worldwide** and can move you to the top of the hiring list. Separate programs exist for federal jobs outside DoD. The preference isn't automatic—you must **claim it properly** on applications and provide documentation. This guide explains exactly how each program works and how to maximize your advantage.

## The Military Spouse Career Challenge

Military spouse preference exists because Congress and DoD recognize:
- Spouses sacrifice careers for military life
- Frequent moves create employment gaps
- Spouse employment improves family readiness
- Retaining military families requires spouse support

**The Reality:**
These programs work—when you know how to use them. Many spouses don't understand the different programs or how to properly claim preference, losing their competitive advantage.

## Understanding the Different Preference Programs

### 1. Military Spouse Preference (MSP) - DoD Positions

**What It Is:**
DoD-specific hiring preference for positions within the Defense Department

**How It Works:**
- You receive preference over other external candidates
- Must be qualified for the position
- Must be within commuting distance of the duty station
- Usable once per permanent duty station

**Positions Covered:**
- All DoD civilian positions (GS, NAF, etc.)
- Worldwide—CONUS and OCONUS
- Competitive and excepted service

**Key Limitation:**
- Can only use ONCE per PCS (not unlimited applications)
- Choose wisely—claim for a job you want

### 2. Priority Placement Program (PPP) - DoD

**What It Is:**
Automatic consideration for DoD positions matching your qualifications

**How It Works:**
- Register in PPP system
- Get matched to positions automatically
- Receive priority consideration over other applicants

**Registration:**
- Contact installation Civilian Personnel Office (CPO)
- Complete registration packet
- Submit qualifications documentation

### 3. Executive Order 13832 - All Federal Agencies

**What It Is:**
Non-competitive hiring authority for all federal agencies

**How It Works:**
- Eligible spouses can be hired without competing
- Agency can directly appoint qualified spouse
- Not automatic—must apply and be selected

**Eligibility:**
- Spouse of active duty service member
- Service member on active duty orders
- Marriage must be current and valid

### 4. State Government Programs

**What It Is:**
Many states have military spouse preference for state jobs

**Varies By State:**
- Some offer points added to exam scores
- Others offer interview preference
- Check your specific state's policies

## MSP (DoD) In Detail

### Eligibility Requirements

**You Must Be:**
- Legal spouse of active duty military member (includes activated Guard/Reserve)
- Relocating to permanent duty station with sponsor
- Within commuting distance of position (usually 50 miles)
- Not currently employed by DoD in a permanent position
- Using preference for FIRST TIME at this duty station

**Sponsor Must Be:**
- On active duty military orders
- Assigned to the duty station where you're applying
- Not in separation/retirement status

### How to Claim MSP

**On USA Jobs Applications:**
1. Create/update profile indicating military spouse status
2. Answer "Yes" to military spouse questions
3. Select "Eligible for Military Spouse Preference"
4. Upload documentation (PCS orders, marriage certificate)

**On Non-USA Jobs DoD Applications:**
1. Indicate MSP eligibility on application
2. Provide required documentation
3. May need to complete separate MSP form

### Required Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| PCS Orders | Proves relocation to area |
| Marriage Certificate | Proves marriage to service member |
| SF-50 (if current fed) | Shows current employment status |
| Military Spouse Preference Form | Some installations require |

### What MSP Actually Does

**Selection Process:**
1. HR reviews applications for minimum qualifications
2. Hiring manager interviews qualified candidates
3. If MSP spouse is among "best qualified," they get preference
4. MSP spouse selected over other equally qualified external candidates

**Critical Understanding:**
- MSP doesn't guarantee job
- You must be qualified
- You must be among "best qualified" candidates
- Hiring manager can still select internal candidates or MSP-exempt positions

### Limitations

**One Use Per Station:**
- Use wisely—claim for a position you really want
- Once accepted, MSP is used until next PCS
- Declined offers may count as use (check with HR)

**Doesn't Override:**
- Veterans' preference (veterans still get priority)
- Internal selections (current federal employees)
- Certain specialized positions
- Positions filled before your application processed

## Executive Order 13832 (All Federal Agencies)

### What Makes This Different

Unlike DoD MSP, this applies to:
- All federal agencies (not just DoD)
- No one-time use limitation
- Non-competitive appointment authority

### How It Works

**Agency Can:**
- Directly appoint you without posting job publicly
- Use non-competitive hiring process
- Bypass normal competitive procedures

**Reality Check:**
- Not automatic—you must find agencies willing to use it
- Some agencies use it actively; others rarely
- Networking helps identify opportunities
- Still requires you to be qualified

### How to Use It

1. **Identify Target Agencies**
   - Research agencies with missions you care about
   - Check if they actively use EO 13832

2. **Network Within Agency**
   - Connect with HR offices
   - Reach out to hiring managers
   - Mention your eligibility

3. **Apply to Positions**
   - Even when not required to compete
   - Reference EO 13832 eligibility
   - Provide spouse documentation

## Priority Placement Program (PPP)

### How Registration Works

**Step 1: Contact CPO**
- Find Civilian Personnel Office at installation
- Request PPP registration packet
- May also be called Stopper List

**Step 2: Complete Registration**
- Specify qualifications and job series
- Indicate geographic availability
- Provide supporting documentation

**Step 3: Automatic Matching**
- System matches you to posted positions
- HR reviews your qualifications
- You're automatically considered for matching jobs

### Benefits

- Passive job search (system works for you)
- Priority consideration
- Covers DoD positions in your area
- Continues until you find position or leave area

### Limitations

- Only DoD positions
- Must match your qualifications exactly
- Geography limits opportunities
- Registration process can be slow

- Texas: Preference in state hiring
- Virginia: Interview preference
- Florida: Points added to exam

- North Carolina: Military spouse designation
- Many others

### How to Research Your State

1. Google: "[State name] military spouse hiring preference"
2. Check state HR or personnel office website

4. Contact state HR office directly

### How to Use State Preference

- Indicate military spouse status on applications
- Provide required documentation
- May need to self-certify
- Follow specific state procedures

## Maximizing Your Preference Advantage

### Strategy for MSP (DoD)

**Don't Waste Your One Use:**
- Apply to multiple positions before claiming MSP
- Get interviews and evaluate opportunities
- Claim MSP only when you have a position you want
- Be strategic—you only get one shot per PCS

**Timing Matters:**
- Apply early after arriving at duty station
- Positions fill—don't wait too long
- Check application deadlines carefully

### Application Tips

**USA Jobs Optimization:**
- Complete profile thoroughly
- Upload all required documents
- Tailor resume to position
- Answer questionnaires accurately
- Claim all applicable preferences

**Follow Up:**
- Check application status regularly
- Contact HR if status unclear
- Be responsive to requests for info
- Keep documentation ready

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Not Claiming Preference**
- Always indicate military spouse status
- Upload documentation even if not asked
- Don't assume HR knows

**Mistake 2: Using MSP Too Early**
- Don't claim MSP on first application just because you can
- Wait until you find a position worth using it for
- Once used, it's gone until next PCS

**Mistake 3: Not Being Qualified**
- Preference doesn't overcome lack of qualifications
- Apply for positions where you're genuinely competitive
- Preference helps among equals—not for unqualified applicants

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Non-DoD Options**
- EO 13832 applies to all federal agencies
- State government may have programs
- Don't limit yourself to DoD
