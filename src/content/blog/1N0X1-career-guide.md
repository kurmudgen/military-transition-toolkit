## Common Transition Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Assuming Your Clearance Automatically Transfers**
Many 1N0s think their clearance magically moves to civilian employment. Reality: Your clearance needs to be transferred by your new employer through their FSO. This can take 30-90 days. Mistake to avoid: Don't let your clearance lapse (expires after 2 years of non-use). Take any cleared job within 2 years even if not ideal, then move to better position later. The clearance is worth $20K+ in salary.

**2. Using Military Jargon in Resumes and Interviews**
Saying "I conducted ISR CONOP development for 380 AEW supporting OIR" means nothing to civilian HR. They'll delete your resume. Solution: Translate everything to civilian terms. Say "I led intelligence planning for 2,500-person organization supporting combat operations in 15-country region." Use the resume examples in this guide as templates. Remove all acronyms except universally known ones (CIA, FBI, DoD).

**3. Undervaluing Your Experience**
Many junior 1N0s accept $60K contractor jobs when they're worth $80K+. Senior NCOs accept $100K when they could get $140K. Mistake: Not researching salary ranges and accepting first offer. Solution: Use Glassdoor, salary.com, and clearancejobs.com salary calculator. Get multiple offers and negotiate. Your TS/SCI alone is worth huge premium. Don't sell yourself short.

**4. Ignoring Non-Contractor Opportunities**
Many 1N0s tunnel-vision on Booz Allen/Leidos because that's what everyone does. They miss out on $150K tech company threat intelligence jobs or $120K corporate intelligence roles that don't require clearances and offer better work-life balance. Solution: Apply broadly. CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Recorded Future, Microsoft all need your skills and pay more than contractors. Cyber threat intelligence is booming and values your all-source methodology.

**5. Waiting Until Terminal Leave to Job Hunt**
Biggest mistake: Starting job search 30 days before separation. Reality: Hiring process takes 60-120 days for cleared positions (application → interviews → clearance transfer → start date). Solution: Start applying 6-12 months before DOS. You can interview while active duty. Companies will wait for your DOS date. Starting late means months of unemployment or desperation accepting bad offers.

## Interview Preparation

### How to Explain Your Air Force Experience

**Framework: Mission → Method → Metrics → Meaning**

When asked "What did you do in the Air Force?" use this structure:

**Mission:** "I served as an intelligence analyst supporting combat operations."

**Method:** "I analyzed intelligence from multiple sources—signals intelligence, imagery, and human intelligence—to identify threats and provide recommendations to commanders."

**Metrics:** "I produced over 200 intelligence reports in 4 years, supporting operations across the Middle East. My analysis directly contributed to successful operations protecting our personnel."

**Meaning:** "This experience taught me how to analyze complex problems, work with incomplete information, brief senior leaders, and deliver time-sensitive analysis under pressure—skills directly applicable to threat intelligence analysis in the corporate sector."

**Common Interview Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How do you handle working with classified information?"**
A: "I maintained Top Secret/SCI clearance for X years, handling sensitive information according to security protocols daily. I'm accustomed to strict information security practices, including need-to-know principles, proper classification procedures, and secure information handling. In the civilian sector, I would apply the same rigor to protecting proprietary corporate information and intellectual property."

**Q: "Describe a time you had to analyze ambiguous or conflicting information."**
A: "Intelligence often involves incomplete or contradictory information. [Give specific example using STAR method]. I used structured analytical techniques to evaluate source reliability, corroborate information across sources, and identify gaps. I presented my findings with confidence levels and recommended collection to fill gaps. This analytical approach applies directly to business intelligence where data quality varies."

**Q: "How do you communicate technical analysis to non-technical audiences?"**
A: "I regularly briefed commanders—pilots, operators, senior officers—who needed intelligence insights without technical jargon. I learned to focus on 'so what'—why this matters and what actions to take—rather than analytical minutiae. I'd use clear visual aids and executive summaries. [Give specific example of successful briefing]. This skill translates to presenting analytical findings to business executives."

### Technical Interview Prep

For contractor roles, expect technical questions on:
- Intelligence cycle and collection management
- Types of intelligence (HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, OSINT) and their strengths/limitations
- Structured analytical techniques (ACH, SATs)
- Intelligence systems you've used (be ready to discuss capabilities)
- Current geopolitical situations and threat actors

For cyber threat intelligence roles, study:
- Cyber threat actors (APT groups, ransomware gangs)
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Threat intelligence platforms (TIPs)
- OSINT tools and techniques

**Preparation Resources:**
- Review ODNI website for unclassified intelligence topics
- Read SANS Reading Room papers on cyber threat intelligence
- Follow threat intel researchers on Twitter
- Study company's published threat intelligence reports before interview
