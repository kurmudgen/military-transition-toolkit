## Bottom Line Up Front

Coast Guard Public Affairs Specialists have **comprehensive multimedia communications skills** that translate directly to corporate communications, public relations, marketing, journalism, and government public affairs careers. Your experience with news writing, photography, videography, social media management, and crisis communications makes you a versatile candidate. Realistic first-year salaries range from **$50,000-$70,000** for entry-level communications and PR roles, with experienced professionals hitting **$75,000-$100,000+** as senior communications managers and **$100,000-$130,000+** in corporate PR and federal public affairs leadership. You've built a portfolio doing real work. That's invaluable.

## Let's address the elephant in the room

Every Coast Guard PA transitioning out wonders: "Can my military public affairs experience compete with civilian communications professionals?"

Here's the truth: **Yes—and you often have more practical experience.**

What you did in the Coast Guard:
- Wrote news releases and media advisories for operational events
- Shot professional still photography and video for Coast Guard operations
- Produced multimedia content for social media, websites, and traditional media
- Served as spokesperson to local and national media outlets
- Managed official social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X)
- Covered search and rescue missions, law enforcement operations, and community events
- Worked with Adobe Creative Suite, video editing software, and content management systems
- Managed crisis communications during high-profile incidents
- Completed 26-week PA "A" School at Fort Meade (news writing, on-camera performance, photography, videography)

That's **more hands-on experience than most civilian communications graduates** have when entering the workforce. You've covered real operations, interviewed real people, and published content consumed by national audiences.

The gap? You need to build a **civilian-facing portfolio** and translate your military public affairs work into corporate communications language. Your skills are there. The presentation needs adjustment.
