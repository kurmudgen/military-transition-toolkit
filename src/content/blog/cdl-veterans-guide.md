# Commercial Driver's License (CDL) for Veterans: Complete Guide

- **Total cost:** $3,000-$8,000 (many programs are FREE for veterans)
- **Average starting salary:** $50,000-$70,000 (experienced: $70,000-$100,000+)

## What Is a CDL?

A Commercial Driver's License (CDL) allows you to operate large commercial vehicles. There are three classes:

**Class A:** Tractor-trailers, combination vehicles over 26,001 lbs—most versatile, highest pay
**Class B:** Single vehicles over 26,001 lbs (buses, straight trucks, dump trucks)
**Class C:** Vehicles transporting hazmat or 16+ passengers

Veterans often qualify for accelerated testing due to military driving experience.

## Why Veterans Excel in Trucking

Military driving experience is directly transferable:

**Vehicle operation:** Military trucks (LMTV, FMTV, HEMTTs) are similar to or larger than civilian commercial vehicles.

**Safety discipline:** Following regulations, pre-trip inspections, and safe driving practices are second nature.

**Professionalism:** Trucking companies value military discipline, reliability, and professionalism.

**Long hours:** You're accustomed to extended operations and managing fatigue.

**Navigation:** Military convoy operations develop route planning and navigation skills.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I skip the CDL driving test with military experience?**
A: Often yes. Most states waive the skills test for veterans with recent military driving experience. Written tests still required.

A: As fast as 1-2 weeks if waiver is granted. Just need to pass written tests and get medical card.

**Q: Which CDL class should I get?**
A: Class A is most versatile and highest paying. Get Class A if possible—you can still drive Class B/C vehicles.
