# South Dakota Veteran Healthcare, Education & Jobs Guide 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

South Dakota operates two VA medical centers—the Royal C. Johnson Veterans Memorial Hospital in Sioux Falls and the Hot Springs VA Medical Center (Black Hills Health Care System)—plus five community-based outpatient clinics across the state. Sioux Falls VAMC is a 98-bed facility providing comprehensive care, while Hot Springs specializes in mental health, substance abuse treatment, and long-term care. About 75% of SD veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care, though rural western and northern areas face longer drives.

For education, South Dakota State University (SDSU) and University of South Dakota (USD) are both GI Bill-approved with strong veteran support services, though neither currently participates in Yellow Ribbon (Mount Marty University does offer Yellow Ribbon for up to $2,500/year). South Dakota's standout benefit: resident veterans with 10%+ disability receive **one month of free tuition for each month of wartime service** (up to four academic years) at state universities. National Guard members get **100% free tuition** at any state-supported university.

Employment is excellent. South Dakota had the **lowest unemployment rate in America at 1.8%** in 2024, and while veteran-specific unemployment data isn't separately tracked for SD, the state's overall full-employment economy means veterans have exceptional job opportunities. Major employers include Ellsworth AFB (4,100+ military personnel, plus contractors), Sanford Health, Avera Health, and growing industries in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.

Overall rating: **7/10** for healthcare (good coverage but rural access challenges), **8.5/10** for education (excellent state benefits, though limited Yellow Ribbon), **9/10** for employment (nation's lowest unemployment rate).

### Healthcare Access Analysis

**Coverage:**
- 75% of SD veterans live within 60 minutes of VA care (clinic or medical center)
- Urban access (Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Aberdeen): Excellent—medical centers or clinics within 15-30 minutes
- Rural access: Moderate to challenging—western and northern SD veterans may drive 60-120 minutes for clinic access, 2+ hours for specialty care at medical centers

**Quality Ratings:**
- Sioux Falls VAMC: Average (3 stars)—solid primary care and mental health, wait times have improved
- Hot Springs VAMC: Average (3 stars)—excellent mental health and substance abuse programs, but limited acute care services

**Wait Times:**
- Primary care: 10-25 days (meets VA standards)
- Mental health: 15-25 days for outpatient appointments; residential programs may have waitlists
- Specialty care: 25-45 days (varies by specialty—cardiology and orthopedics run longer)

**Areas for improvement:** Veterans in far western SD (near Montana/Wyoming borders) and northern SD (near North Dakota border) face 2+ hour drives to VA facilities. Telehealth has expanded access, but in-person specialty care requires significant travel.

### Community Care (Non-VA Options)

South Dakota has robust Community Care networks to supplement VA services:

- **Networks:** Sanford Health, Avera Health, Monument Health, Avera McKennan, Regional Health
- **Coverage:** VA authorizes and pays for care at civilian facilities when VA cannot provide timely access

**TRICARE:** Military retirees have good TRICARE network access in Sioux Falls and Rapid City metro areas; limited in rural regions.

### State Education Benefits

**Free Tuition for Disabled Veterans (10%+ Disability)**

South Dakota offers **one month of free tuition for each month of qualifying wartime service** to resident veterans with at least 10% disability rating.

- **Eligibility:** SD resident veterans with 10%+ service-connected disability rating, wartime service
- **Benefit:** One month of free tuition per month of wartime service (maximum four academic years)
- **Applies to:** Any state-supported university or in-state nonprofit post-secondary university
- **Value:** $9,620-$9,760/year (in-state tuition at USD/SDSU) x up to 4 years = **$38,480-$39,040 total**

**Example:** If you served 36 months during wartime and have a 30% VA rating, you receive 36 months (3 academic years) of free tuition at SDSU or USD. Combined with GI Bill housing allowance and book stipend, you can attend college with zero out-of-pocket costs and pocket extra BAH.

This is one of the best state veteran education benefits in the country. You can potentially stack this with GI Bill (use state benefit for tuition, GI Bill for BAH), though VA may require coordination of benefits—consult a school certifying official.

**National Guard Tuition Waiver**

Members of the South Dakota National Guard receive **100% tuition waiver** at state-supported universities and in-state nonprofit post-secondary universities.

- **Eligibility:** Active member of SD National Guard in good standing
- **Benefit:** 100% reduction in tuition charges
- **Undergraduate limit:** 128 credits
- **Graduate limit:** 32 credits
- **Value:** $39,040 (4 years undergrad at SDSU/USD) or $12,800+ (graduate programs)

Guard members can attend college tuition-free while serving, a massive benefit that saves nearly $40,000 over four years.

**In-State Tuition for Veterans**

Veterans discharged within the past 3 years qualify for in-state tuition at South Dakota public universities under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, regardless of residency.

- **Savings:** $4,520/year at SDSU; $4,070/year at USD (out-of-state vs. in-state difference)

This eliminates the tuition gap for Post-9/11 GI Bill users, ensuring GI Bill covers 100% of tuition.

**Dependent/Spouse Education Benefits**

Dependents and spouses of veterans may qualify for free tuition at state community colleges or technical schools if the veteran is:
- 100% permanently and totally disabled
- POW or MIA
- Medal of Honor recipient

Contact the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs for current eligibility and application procedures.

## Employment & Career Resources

### Veteran Unemployment Rate

- **SD overall unemployment:** 1.8% (2024—**lowest in America**)
- **SD veteran-specific unemployment:** Not separately tracked for SD, but national veteran unemployment is 3.0% (2024)
- **National overall unemployment:** 3.9% (2024)

South Dakota consistently has the lowest unemployment rate in the United States. The 2024 annual average of 1.8% represents essentially full employment. While state-level veteran unemployment data isn't published separately, South Dakota's robust economy means veterans have exceptional job opportunities.

In 2022 (most recent SD veteran-specific data), South Dakota veteran unemployment was 4.0% compared to 2.7% for non-veterans—higher than non-veterans but still low in absolute terms. Given the state's 2024 overall rate of 1.8%, veteran unemployment has likely improved significantly.

The SD Department of Labor provides dedicated services for veterans through the SDWorks program:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to get a VA appointment in South Dakota?**

A: Primary care averages 10-20 days at Sioux Falls, 15-25 days at Hot Springs. Mental health is 15-25 days for outpatient. Specialty care runs 25-45 days depending on the specialty. Telehealth appointments are often available sooner.

A: Yes. SDSU, USD, Northern State, and all four technical colleges are GI Bill-approved. Tuition is fully covered, and you receive BAH.

**Q: Does SDSU or USD participate in Yellow Ribbon?**

A: No. They're public universities, so GI Bill covers 100% of in-state tuition. Veterans qualify for in-state tuition under federal law, eliminating any gap. Mount Marty University (private) offers Yellow Ribbon.

**Q: What's the free tuition benefit for disabled veterans?**

A: SD resident veterans with 10%+ service-connected disability receive one month of free tuition for each month of wartime service (up to 4 academic years) at state universities. If you served 48 months during wartime and have a 20% rating, you get four full years of free tuition.

**Q: What's the job market like for veterans in South Dakota?**

A: Excellent. South Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate in America (1.8% in 2024). Jobs are plentiful in healthcare (Sanford, Avera), financial services (Citibank, Wells Fargo), and around Ellsworth AFB. State jobs offer 5-10 point veteran preference.

**Q: Is there VA dental care in South Dakota?**

A: Limited. Dental is available for 100% disabled veterans, those with service-connected dental conditions, or veterans in specific programs. Dental services are provided at Sioux Falls and Hot Springs medical centers.

**Q: Can I get VA healthcare if I live in western South Dakota (Rapid City area)?**
