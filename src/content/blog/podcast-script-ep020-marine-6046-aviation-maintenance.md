[INTRO]
**Cold Open:** 6046 - aircraft maintenance. Airframes, powerplants, hydraulics, avionics. A&P mechanics make seventy-eight thousand median, top earners one hundred twenty thousand plus. Your Marine aviation experience opens doors. Path similar to Air Force 2A (Episode 5).

**Your 6046 Value:** Maintained military aircraft, troubleshot complex systems, performed inspections, worked to strict maintenance standards. Civilian aviation needs exactly this.

**Career Path:** Identical to Episode 5 (Air Force aviation maintenance). A&P license critical. Aircraft mechanic median $78,680. Airlines $80K-$120K+. Major airlines (Delta, American, United) actively hiring Marines. Marine aviation maintenance reputation strong.

**A&P License Process:**

**Option 1 - Military Experience Route:** Use documented Marine aviation maintenance experience to qualify for FAA exams. Need 30 months airframe OR powerplant, or 18 months both simultaneously. Most 6046s qualify.

Process: Get Marine maintenance records/documentation → Apply to FAA FSDO → Take written tests (3 exams) → Take oral/practical exams → Receive A&P license. Cost $1,000-$1,500 total vs $15K-$40K aviation school.

**Option 2 - FAA School:** 18-24 month program if documentation insufficient. GI Bill covers. Comprehensive but time-intensive.

**Companies:** All major airlines (Delta, American, United, Southwest need mechanics), FedEx/UPS cargo operations, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, MRO facilities (maintenance/repair/overhaul), regional airlines, business aviation.

**Certification Timeline:** 12mo out gather Marine maintenance documentation, 6-9mo take A&P written exams, 3-6mo complete practical exams, separation start mechanic job $70K-$90K.

**Specializations:** Avionics tech ($81K median - higher than general mechanics), engine specialist, inspection authorization (IA) after 3 years adds $10K-$20K.

**Marine Advantage:** Marine aviation maintenance standards rigorous. Civilian employers recognize quality. Your troubleshooting under pressure valued.

**Work Environment:** Airlines offer shift premiums, overtime opportunities, flight benefits. MRO facilities steadier schedule. Defense contractors (working on military aircraft as civilian) familiar work at good pay.
