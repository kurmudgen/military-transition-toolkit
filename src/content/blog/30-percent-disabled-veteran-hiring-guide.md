# 30% or More Disabled Veteran Hiring: Your Direct Path to Any Federal Job

If you have a VA disability rating of 30% or higher, you have access to the most powerful veteran hiring authority in federal employment.

The 30% or More Disabled Veteran authority lets agencies hire you non-competitively for ANY federal position—no grade limits, no competition, no waiting for certificates. If you're qualified and the agency wants you, they can hire you directly.

This guide explains how this authority works, how to use it effectively, and how to maximize your advantage as a disabled veteran.

## What Is the 30% or More Disabled Veteran Authority?

This is a special appointing authority (5 CFR 316.302(b)(4) and 5 U.S.C. 3112) that allows federal agencies to directly appoint veterans who have a service-connected disability rated at 30% or more.

### Key Features

**Non-competitive appointment:** Agencies can hire you without posting the job publicly or competing with other candidates.

**No grade limit:** Unlike VRA (capped at GS-11), this authority covers ALL grades—GS-1 through SES.

**Permanent or temporary:** Can be used for permanent, term, or temporary appointments.

**Any position:** Works for competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service positions.

**No time limit:** Your eligibility never expires (as long as you maintain 30%+ rating).

### The Power Comparison

| Authority | Grade Limit | Competition | Time Limit |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **30% Disabled** | None | Non-competitive | None |
| VRA | GS-11 | Non-competitive | 3 years* |
| VEOA | None | Competitive | None |
| Veterans Preference | None | Competitive | None |

*VRA time limit waived if disabled

The 30% disabled authority is objectively the most flexible veteran hiring tool available.

## Eligibility Requirements

### Requirement 1: VA Disability Rating of 30% or More

You must have a **combined** disability rating of at least 30% for **service-connected** conditions.

**What counts:**
- Combined rating of 30%+ from multiple conditions
- Single condition rated at 30%+
- Any service-connected disability that totals 30%+

**What doesn't count:**
- Non-service-connected disabilities
- Pending claims (must be adjudicated)
- Individual conditions under 30% if combined total is under 30%

### Requirement 2: Documentation

You need official VA documentation showing:
- Your disability rating percentage
- That disabilities are service-connected
- Current validity (letter dated within 1 year preferred)

**Acceptable documents:**
- VA Benefits Summary Letter
- VA Rating Decision Letter
- SF-15 (for preference documentation)

### Requirement 3: Position Qualifications

You must still meet the qualifications for the specific position:
- Specialized experience requirements
- Education requirements (if applicable)
- Certifications/licenses (if required)
- Security clearance (if required)

**The authority gets you in the door non-competitively, but you still have to be qualified for the job.**

## How the Hiring Process Works

### Traditional Competitive Hiring
1. Position posted on USAJOBS
2. Hundreds of applications received
3. HR rates and ranks all applicants
4. Certificate of eligibles created
5. Hiring manager selects from certificate
6. Selected candidate receives offer

### 30% Disabled Veteran Hiring
1. Hiring manager has position to fill
2. Manager identifies qualified disabled veteran
3. HR verifies 30%+ rating and qualifications
4. Appointment made

**Notice what's bypassed:** No public posting required, no competition, no certificate process.

### What This Means Practically

You can:
- Apply directly to hiring managers (not just USAJOBS)
- Be considered outside normal competitive processes
- Be hired faster than traditional applicants
- Access positions that may never be publicly posted

The key is connecting with hiring managers who have positions to fill and want to use this authority.

## Finding Opportunities

### Strategy 1: USAJOBS (Still Important)

Many positions are still posted on USAJOBS and note they're open to 30% or more disabled veterans:
- Look for "30% or more disabled veterans" in eligibility
- Filter by "Veterans" in who may apply
- Read announcement for special hiring authority mentions

### Strategy 2: Agency Disabled Veteran Program Managers

Every federal agency has a Selective Placement Program Coordinator (SPPC):
- They help place disabled veterans in positions
- They know about upcoming opportunities
- They can connect you with hiring managers

**Find SPPCs through:**
- Agency human resources websites
- Federal agency SAFECOM databases
- Contacting agency HR directly

### Strategy 3: Direct Hiring Manager Outreach

Because this authority is non-competitive, you can approach hiring managers directly:

**Step 1:** Research agencies and positions of interest
**Step 2:** Identify potential hiring managers via LinkedIn, agency directories
**Step 3:** Craft targeted outreach explaining your qualifications and authority
**Step 4:** Follow up professionally

**Sample outreach:**

> Subject: Qualified Disabled Veteran for [Position Type] Opportunities
>
> Dear [Hiring Manager],
>
> I am a disabled veteran with 8 years of military experience in [relevant field]. I have a VA service-connected disability rating of [X]%, which makes me eligible for non-competitive appointment under the 30% or More Disabled Veteran hiring authority.
>
> I am interested in [position type] opportunities within your organization. My background includes [brief relevant experience]. I have attached my federal resume and can provide VA documentation upon request.
>
> I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your team's needs.
>
> Respectfully,
> [Your Name]
> [Phone]
> [Email]

### Strategy 4: Veteran Employment Programs

**VA for Vets:** vaforvets.va.gov
- Connects disabled veterans with opportunities
- Resume assistance
- Job matching

**Hire Heroes USA:** hireheroesusa.org
- Free career coaching
- Employer connections
- Resume services

**American Corporate Partners:** acp-usa.org
- Mentorship with business leaders
- Career guidance
- Network access

### Strategy 5: Defense Contractors → Federal

Many disabled veterans start with contractors then use their authority for federal positions:
- Contractor experience demonstrates qualifications
- Relationships with federal managers built
- Transition to federal when opportunity arises

## Appointment Types Under This Authority

### Schedule A Appointment (Most Common)

Schedule A excepted service appointment:
- Can be temporary or permanent
- Converts to competitive service after 2 years of successful performance
- Full benefits from day one

### Direct Appointment to Competitive Service

Some agencies can appoint directly to competitive service:
- Check agency-specific policies
- Immediate permanent status
- No 2-year conversion needed

### Term or Temporary Appointments

The authority can also be used for:
- Term appointments (1-4 years)
- Temporary appointments (less than 1 year)
- Intermittent positions

**Consider carefully:** Permanent positions are generally preferable for career stability.

## Conversion to Competitive Service

If initially appointed to excepted service via Schedule A:

### The 2-Year Requirement

- Must complete 2 years of satisfactory service
- Performance must be acceptable or better
- No major disciplinary issues

### After Conversion

- Full competitive service status
- Eligible for merit promotion
- Full appeal and grievance rights
- Career (or career-conditional) appointment

### What Could Prevent Conversion

- Unsatisfactory performance
- Serious misconduct
- Position elimination
- Failure to meet conditions of employment

These are rare—most disabled veterans convert successfully.

## Grade and Salary Considerations

### No Grade Ceiling

Unlike VRA (GS-11 limit), this authority works at any level:
- Entry-level (GS-5/7)
- Journey-level (GS-9/11)
- Senior-level (GS-12/13)
- Executive-level (GS-14/15)
- Senior Executive Service (SES)

### Matching Your Experience

**E-4 to E-6 experience:** Typically GS-7 to GS-11
**E-7 to E-9 experience:** Typically GS-11 to GS-13
**O-3 to O-4 experience:** Typically GS-12 to GS-13
**O-5+ experience:** Typically GS-14 to GS-15

Your grade should match your experience level—the authority doesn't give you a higher grade than you're qualified for.

### Negotiating Salary

You can still negotiate:
- Superior Qualifications appointment (higher step)
- Recruitment incentives
- Relocation bonuses
- Retention incentives (for hard-to-fill positions)

**Strategy:** The authority gives you leverage. Agencies that want to hire you non-competitively may also negotiate more favorably.

## Pass Over Protection

The 30%+ disabled veteran authority includes special protections:

### CPS (Compensable Preference - 30% or More)

Veterans with 30%+ disability have CPS preference status in competitive hiring:
- Must be considered before lower-preference candidates
- Agency must request OPM approval to pass over CPS veteran
- Strong protection in competitive processes

### In Non-Competitive Hiring

When using the 30% authority directly:
- No formal pass over protection (not competing)
- But agencies using this authority are motivated to hire veterans

## Combined Benefits

### 30% Authority + Veterans Preference

You have BOTH:
- Non-competitive appointment option (30% authority)
- 10-point CPS preference (for competitive positions)

**Strategy:** Apply non-competitively via 30% authority AND competitively with 10-point preference to maximize opportunities.

### 30% Authority + VRA

If you also meet VRA requirements:
- VRA for positions GS-11 and below
- 30% authority for positions at any grade
- Use whichever is more advantageous for specific situation

### 30% Authority + VEOA

VEOA gives access to merit promotion announcements:
- Apply to internal federal positions via VEOA
- Apply non-competitively via 30% authority
- Multiple pathways to same positions

## Common Questions

### "Do I need 30% in one condition or combined?"

**Combined.** Your overall VA disability rating is what matters. Multiple conditions that combine to 30%+ qualify you.

### "What if my rating changes?"

- Rating increases: Expanded eligibility (if now 30%+)
- Rating decreases: If you drop below 30%, you lose this specific authority (but may still have VRA, preference, etc.)
- During federal employment: Rating changes don't affect current employment

### "Can agencies refuse to use this authority?"

Agencies aren't required to use this authority—but most are very open to it. If one manager or agency isn't interested, others will be.

### "Is there stigma to being hired this way?"

No. You're hired as a federal employee like everyone else. How you were hired is an administrative detail, not a job performance issue.

### "Do I have to disclose my specific disabilities?"

No. You only need to document the rating percentage and that it's service-connected. Specific conditions are private.

### "What if I have a 100% rating?"

Same authority applies—30% is the minimum, not the maximum. Higher ratings don't provide additional hiring advantages (though they do affect VA benefits).

Apply multiple ways to same positions:
- Non-competitive (30% authority)
- Competitive (with 10-point CPS preference)
- VEOA (for merit promotion positions)

### Don't Undervalue Yourself

You earned this authority through service that resulted in permanent disability:
- It's not charity—it's recognition
- Agencies benefit from hiring experienced veterans
- Use the authority confidently

## The Bottom Line

The 30% or More Disabled Veteran authority is exceptional:

**Unique advantages:**
- Non-competitive appointment
- No grade ceiling
- No time limit

**Your action steps:**
1. Verify your 30%+ combined rating
2. Obtain current VA documentation
3. Prepare federal resume
4. Contact agency SPPCs
5. Apply via USAJOBS AND direct outreach
6. Use all available authorities simultaneously

Your disability rating reflects sacrifice in service to the country. This authority ensures that sacrifice opens doors—not closes them.
