# GI Bill Comparison: Post-9/11 vs. Montgomery GI Bill (Complete Guide)

## Bottom Line Up Front

Most veterans should use the **Post-9/11 GI Bill**—it pays tuition directly, provides a housing allowance, and includes a book stipend. The **Montgomery GI Bill** pays a flat monthly rate regardless of school cost. Post-9/11 is almost always more valuable unless you're attending a very inexpensive school while working full-time. **You can only use one at a time**, and you have **36 months total** between them. This guide helps you choose wisely.

## Overview Comparison

| Feature | Post-9/11 GI Bill | Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Tuition | Paid directly to school | Flat monthly payment |
| Housing | Monthly BAH (E-5 rate) | None (unless kicker) |
| Books | $1,000/year | Included in flat payment |
| Payment method | School + student | All to student |
| Contribution required | None | $1,200 during service |
| Best for | Most situations | Some part-time/cheap school scenarios |

## Scenario Comparisons

### Scenario 1: Full-Time at State University

**School:** State university, $12,000/year tuition, moderate cost area

**Post-9/11:**
- Tuition: $12,000 paid to school
- Housing: $2,000/month × 9 = $18,000
- Books: $1,000
- **Total: $31,000**

**MGIB:**
- Payment: $2,175 × 9 = $19,575
- Tuition: -$12,000
- **Remaining: $7,575**

**Winner: Post-9/11 by ~$23,000**

### Scenario 2: Part-Time at Community College (Working Full-Time)

**School:** Community college, $3,000/year, working full-time so don't need housing

**Post-9/11 (half-time):**
- Tuition: $3,000
- Housing: $1,000/month × 9 = $9,000 (half-time rate)
- Books: $500
- **Total: $12,500**

**MGIB (half-time):**
- Payment: $1,088 × 9 = $9,792
- Tuition: -$3,000
- **Remaining: $6,792 (plus you didn't need housing)**

**Closer call:** Post-9/11 still provides more total value, but if you truly don't need the housing benefit, MGIB keeps more cash in your pocket after tuition.

### Scenario 3: Expensive Private University

**School:** Private university, $50,000/year tuition

**Post-9/11:**
- Tuition cap: $27,120
- Yellow Ribbon (if participating): Could cover remainder
- Housing: $3,000/month × 9 = $27,000
- Books: $1,000
- **Total without Yellow Ribbon: ~$55,000**
- **With Yellow Ribbon: Potentially full coverage**

**MGIB:**
- Payment: $2,175 × 9 = $19,575
- Tuition: -$50,000
- **Gap: -$30,425 out of pocket**

**Winner: Post-9/11 by significant margin**

## Yellow Ribbon Program

### What It Is

Schools can participate in Yellow Ribbon to cover tuition above the Post-9/11 cap:
- School contributes additional funds
- VA matches the school's contribution
- Can cover full tuition at expensive schools

### How It Works

**Example:**
- Private school tuition: $50,000
- Post-9/11 cap: $27,120
- Gap: $22,880
- School contributes: $11,440
- VA matches: $11,440
- **Total coverage: $50,000**

### Finding Yellow Ribbon Schools

Search the VA's Yellow Ribbon directory at va.gov for participating schools and their contribution amounts.

### Eligibility

- Must have 100% Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility
- School must participate
- May have limited spots (first-come basis at some schools)

## Choosing Between Them

### Use Post-9/11 GI Bill If:

- You're attending full-time
- You're attending in-person (or mostly in-person)
- Housing allowance is valuable to you
- You're going to a moderately expensive or expensive school
- Your school participates in Yellow Ribbon (for expensive schools)
- You didn't pay into MGIB

### Consider MGIB If:

- Attending very cheap school while working full-time
- Don't need housing benefit
- Unique circumstances where flat payment is advantageous
- Paid into MGIB and want to "get your money back"

### The 99% Answer

**For 99% of veterans: Post-9/11 GI Bill is better.** The housing allowance alone usually exceeds MGIB's total payment.

## Transfer to Dependents

### Post-9/11 Only

You can transfer Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to spouse or children:

**Requirements:**
- 6+ years of service
- Commit to 4 additional years
- Must apply while still serving
- DoD approval required

**Considerations:**
- Transfer while serving—can't transfer after separation
- Can divide among multiple dependents
- Remaining benefit transfers

### MGIB Cannot Be Transferred

Montgomery GI Bill cannot be transferred to dependents.

## Using Both (Buy-Up and Combinations)

### 36 Months Total

Between both GI Bills, you have 36 months of benefits. You can use both, but they share this pool.

### MGIB to Post-9/11 Conversion

If you were using MGIB and want to switch to Post-9/11:
- You can convert (irrevocable)
- Remaining MGIB months convert to Post-9/11 months
- Does NOT refund your $1,200 contribution

### Post-9/11 Buy-Up (Kicker)

If eligible, you can receive MGIB kicker payments on top of Post-9/11:
- Must have qualified for kicker during service
- Additional $200-600/month

## Tips for Maximizing Benefits

### Time Your Usage

- **Housing allowance varies by location** - More valuable in expensive areas
- **Academic year vs. year-round** - Summer terms can extend value
- **Full-time maximizes housing** - Half-time = half housing

### Combine with Other Benefits

- **Federal financial aid** - GI Bill doesn't affect most aid
- **Scholarships** - Can receive on top of GI Bill
- **Employer tuition assistance** - Sometimes combinable
- **State veteran education benefits** - Additional programs available

### Consider In-State Residency

- Post-9/11 pays in-state tuition at public schools
- Many states offer in-state tuition for veterans regardless of residency
- Research your state's policies

### Use All 36 Months

Plan your education to use your full benefit:
- Undergraduate: 36 months usually covers 4-year degree
- Graduate school: May need to fund final semesters separately
- Certificates/vocational: Can be used for many programs

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not using the benefit** - It's valuable; use it
2. **Using MGIB when Post-9/11 is better** - Post-9/11 usually wins
3. **Not researching Yellow Ribbon** - Free money at expensive schools
4. **Not establishing residency** - In-state saves money
5. **Forgetting transfer deadline** - Must transfer while serving
6. **Not maximizing housing** - Full-time enrollment maximizes benefit
7. **Not combining with other aid** - Scholarships, grants, etc.

2. Complete **VA Form 22-1990**

3. **Housing varies by location** - Worth more in expensive areas
4. **Yellow Ribbon** can cover expensive private schools
