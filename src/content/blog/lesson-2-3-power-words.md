### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Lesson 2.3 - Power Words and Action Verbs]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to the final lesson in Module 2! You've eliminated jargon and quantified your accomplishments. Now we need to make them powerful with the right action verbs.

**[ON SCREEN: "The First Word of Every Bullet Matters Most"]**

Here's the thing: the action verb you choose sets the tone for your entire accomplishment. It tells the hiring manager your level of responsibility and leadership.

"Assisted with" signals junior-level support.
"Directed" signals senior leadership.

In this lesson, I'm going to give you a complete library of 100+ power verbs organized by responsibility level, and show you exactly which verbs to use based on your rank and the job you're targeting.

Let's make every word on your resume count.

---

### PART 1: WHY ACTION VERBS MATTER (0:30-2:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Action Verbs Set Your Level of Responsibility"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me show you why the verb you choose is so critical. Take these three statements:

**[ON SCREEN: Three examples side by side]**

1. "Helped with training for new personnel"
2. "Conducted training for new personnel"
3. "Designed training for new personnel"

All three describe training, but they signal very different levels of responsibility:

**"Helped with" = Support role, junior level**
You assisted someone else who was actually in charge.

**"Conducted" = Execution role, mid-level**
You were responsible for delivering the training.

**"Designed" = Creation role, senior level**
You built the training program from scratch.

**[ON SCREEN: "Passive vs. Active Voice"]**

Now let me show you another critical distinction: passive vs. active voice.

❌ Passive: "Was responsible for training"
✅ Active: "Trained"

❌ Passive: "Tasked with managing inventory"
✅ Active: "Managed inventory"

❌ Passive: "Served as team leader"
✅ Active: "Led team"

**[ON SCREEN: "Passive voice = weaker impact"]**

Passive voice makes you sound like things happened TO you, not that you made things happen. Active voice demonstrates ownership and initiative.

Always use active voice. Always start with a strong action verb.

### PART 2: RANK-APPROPRIATE VERB SELECTION (2:30-6:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "E5-E6 vs. E7-E9 Verb Selection"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's where a lot of veterans go wrong: they either undersell or oversell their level of responsibility by choosing the wrong verbs.

An E-5 shouldn't say they "directed" if they actually "coordinated."
An E-8 shouldn't say they "assisted" if they actually "managed."

Let me break down verb selection by rank.

**[ON SCREEN: E5-E6 Power Verbs]**

**E5-E6 (SERGEANT, STAFF SERGEANT / PETTY OFFICER 2ND & 1ST CLASS)**

At this level, you're supervising teams and executing missions. You're not setting strategic direction yet.

**Leadership verbs:**
- Supervised
- Led
- Trained
- Coordinated
- Facilitated
- Guided
- Mentored
- Coached

**Execution verbs:**
- Executed
- Implemented
- Conducted
- Performed
- Completed
- Delivered
- Maintained
- Operated

**Problem-solving verbs:**
- Resolved
- Improved
- Streamlined
- Enhanced
- Optimized
- Reduced (costs, time, errors)

**Real E-6 Examples:**

✅ "Supervised 12-person maintenance team"
✅ "Coordinated training for 45 personnel"
✅ "Implemented new safety protocols"
✅ "Streamlined supply requisition process"

❌ Don't use (too senior): Directed, Commanded, Established, Architected

**[ON SCREEN: E7-E9 Power Verbs]**

**E7-E9 (SERGEANT FIRST CLASS through SERGEANT MAJOR / CHIEF PETTY OFFICER through MASTER CHIEF)**

At this level, you're managing programs, directing departments, and setting strategic direction.

**Strategic leadership verbs:**
- Directed
- Managed
- Oversaw
- Led (larger scale)
- Spearheaded
- Championed
- Drove

**Program/organizational verbs:**
- Established
- Developed
- Created
- Built
- Designed
- Architected
- Restructured

**Senior advisor verbs:**
- Advised
- Counseled (senior leaders)
- Recommended
- Influenced
- Shaped
- Guided (policy/strategy)

**Real E-8 Examples:**

✅ "Directed 45-person operations department across 3 sections"
✅ "Established comprehensive training program for 200+ personnel"
✅ "Advised commander on personnel and readiness matters"
✅ "Spearheaded equipment modernization initiative"

❌ Don't undersell yourself with: Helped, Assisted, Supported (unless genuinely accurate)

**[ON SCREEN: "Match Your Verb to Your Actual Role"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's the key: be honest about your actual level of responsibility.

If you were an E-7 platoon sergeant, you "supervised" or "led" your platoon - you didn't "assist" with it.

But if you were asked to help the company commander with a special project, you "assisted" or "supported" - you didn't "direct" it.

Accuracy matters. Don't inflate your role, but don't diminish it either.

### PART 4: AVOIDING WEAK AND OVERUSED VERBS (10:00-12:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Verbs to Avoid or Use Sparingly"]**

   ✅ Instead use: Developed, Built, Created, Executed

   ✅ Instead use: Managed, Resolved, Addressed, Handled (in formal context)
