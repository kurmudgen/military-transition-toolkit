# Tennessee Veteran Tax Benefits 2025: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Tennessee's best veteran tax benefit is having no state income tax—saving military retirees $2,500-$5,000+ annually on retirement income alone. For disabled veterans, the state offers property tax relief up to $175,000 of assessed home value for 100% P&T disabled veterans and POWs, worth $2,000-$4,000 annually depending on your county. A 100% disabled veteran with $50,000 military retirement and a $350,000 home can save $5,500+ annually compared to neighboring states with income taxes.

Tennessee ranks in the top 10 states nationally for veteran tax benefits. The combination of no income tax, property tax relief for 100% disabled veterans, and free vehicle registration for certain disabled veterans creates substantial savings. A 100% disabled veteran with $50,000 military retirement saves approximately $6,500 annually compared to Georgia (which taxes military retirement).

The property tax relief structure provides state reimbursement (not an exemption) for qualifying disabled veterans on up to $175,000 assessed value of their primary residence. This means you still receive your tax bill and pay it, but the state reimburses you after payment. Veterans with 100% P&T disability, POW status, or specific service-connected disabilities qualify.

Downsides? Tennessee has high sales tax (9.46% average—highest nationally) and moderate property taxes (0.58-0.68% effective rate), so the relief is valuable but doesn't eliminate all costs. If you don't qualify for the property tax relief (under 100% rating or not service-connected), you'll pay full property tax with no state-level veteran discount.

Overall verdict: Tennessee is excellent for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees, ranking among the best Southern states. If you're under 100% disabled without qualifying conditions, benefits are limited to income tax savings.

## Property Tax Benefits

### Property Tax Relief for Disabled Veterans

**100% Disabled Veterans (Permanent & Total):**
- Relief amount: **Up to $175,000 of assessed property value**
- Typical annual savings: $2,000-$4,000 depending on county tax rate
- Requirements: 100% P&T service-connected disability from VA; primary residence; Tennessee resident
- Process: State reimburses you after you pay property taxes
- Annual savings example: $2,500-$3,500 (based on 0.58-0.68% effective rate)

If you're rated 100% P&T by the VA, Tennessee provides property tax relief on up to $175,000 assessed value of your primary residence. This isn't an exemption—you still pay your tax bill, then the state reimburses you. The actual dollar savings depend on your county's tax rate.

**Alternative Qualifications for Property Tax Relief:**
- **Former Prisoners of War:** Same relief as 100% P&T ($175,000 assessed value)
- **Paraplegic veterans:** Service-connected paraplegia qualifies
- **Loss of use of limbs:** Service-connected total loss of use
- **Legal blindness:** Service-connected blindness qualifies

**Under 100% / General Veterans:**
- Property tax relief: None for veterans rated below 100%
- No general veteran exemption for non-disabled veterans
- Standard property tax applies

Tennessee doesn't offer partial relief for 50-90% disabled veterans. It's all or nothing—full relief at 100% P&T (or qualifying conditions), or no relief.

### How to Apply

1. **Contact your local County Trustee's office** (Davidson County for Nashville, Shelby County for Memphis, Knox County for Knoxville, etc.)
2. **Gather required documents:**
   - DD Form 214 (Member Copy 4)
   - VA award letter showing 100% P&T disability (or POW status, or qualifying disability)
   - Proof of Tennessee residency
   - Property deed showing ownership
   - Social Security card

3. **File application with County Trustee**
   - Deadline: Varies by county (typically by property tax due date)
   - Processing: 30-90 days
   - Effective: Current tax year if filed timely
   - Reimbursement: Issued after you pay your property tax bill

**Important:** You must pay your property tax bill first, then receive reimbursement from the state. The relief is not an automatic exemption. However, once approved, the program typically renews automatically if your status doesn't change.

### Property Tax by County

Tennessee's average effective property tax rate is 0.58-0.68%, which is moderate nationally. This makes the veteran property tax relief valuable:

| County/City | Median Home Value | Effective Tax Rate | Annual Tax (Non-Relief) | Savings (100% Disabled) |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Davidson (Nashville) | $460,000 | 0.63% | $2,898 | $2,500-$2,898* |
| Shelby (Memphis) | $225,000 | 1.16% | $2,610 | $2,610 |
| Knox (Knoxville) | $335,000 | 0.65% | $2,178 | $2,178 |
| Hamilton (Chattanooga) | $295,000 | 0.70% | $2,065 | $2,065 |
| Montgomery (Clarksville) | $310,000 | 0.70% | $2,170 | $2,170 |
| Williamson (Franklin) | $898,000 | 0.55% | $4,939 | $3,500-$4,000* |

*Savings capped at $175,000 assessed value, which varies by county assessment ratio (typically 25% of market value)

**Example:** A 100% disabled veteran with a $460,000 home in Nashville saves approximately $2,500-$2,898 annually in property taxes (depending on assessed value calculation). The state reimburses this amount after the veteran pays the property tax bill.

Over 20 years, that's $50,000-$58,000 in tax relief.

### Assessment Ratios

Tennessee uses assessment ratios to calculate property taxes. Residential property is assessed at 25% of appraised value. So a $400,000 home has an assessed value of $100,000, which is then taxed at the county/city rate.

The $175,000 property tax relief applies to assessed value (not market value), which typically equates to a market value of $700,000 (at 25% assessment ratio). Most homes fall completely within this cap.

## Income Tax Treatment

### Military Retirement Pay

- State tax: **$0—Tennessee has no state income tax**
- Federal tax: Still taxed federally
- Annual savings: $2,500-$5,000+ compared to taxing states

Tennessee is one of eight states with no state income tax (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, and New Hampshire). Military retirement pay, civilian wages, Social Security, pensions—all tax-free at the state level.

**Example savings:**
- O-5 retiree with $70,000 pension:
  - In Georgia (5.75% top rate): $4,025 state tax
  - In Tennessee: $0
  - **Annual savings: $4,025**

- E-7 retiree with $40,000 pension:
  - In North Carolina (4.5% rate): $1,800 state tax
  - In Tennessee: $0
  - **Annual savings: $1,800**

- O-6 retiree with $90,000 pension:
  - In Kentucky (4% rate): $3,600 state tax
  - In Tennessee: $0
  - **Annual savings: $3,600**

**Note:** Tennessee eliminated its Hall Tax (tax on interest and dividends) effective January 1, 2021. Tennessee now has zero state income tax on any income source—wages, retirement, investment income, capital gains—all tax-free.

### VA Disability Compensation

- Tax status: 100% exempt federally and in all states
- Tennessee: Not taxed

All VA disability compensation is tax-free everywhere.

### Survivor Benefits (SBP)

- Tennessee taxation: $0 (no income tax)
- Federal: Taxed federally

Surviving spouses pay zero Tennessee state tax on SBP payments.

### Other Military Income

- **Drill pay (Guard/Reserve):** Not subject to TN state tax (no income tax)
- **Combat pay:** Federally exempt; TN doesn't tax it either
- **Active duty pay:** Not taxed by TN if you maintain out-of-state residency under SCRA

## Vehicle & Registration Benefits

**Disabled Veteran Plates:**
- Cost: **Free registration** for 100% P&T disabled veterans (one vehicle)
- Additional vehicles: Half-price registration
- Disabled Veteran (DV) plates available
- Annual savings: $26-$60 (depending on vehicle weight)

Qualifying disabled veterans (100% P&T) receive free registration for one vehicle and half-price registration for additional vehicles.

**Sales Tax Exemption on Vehicles:**

- **VA Automobile Grant Recipients:** Veterans who receive a VA automobile grant due to service-connected disability are exempt from:
  - Motor vehicle sales tax (7% state)
  - Registration fees
  - Local motor vehicle privilege tax (wheel tax)
- **Exemption amount:** Limited to the portion of sales price exceeding the VA grant amount

**Example:** If you receive a $22,015 VA automobile grant and buy a $40,000 vehicle:
- Taxable amount: $17,985
- You still pay sales tax on $17,985
- If the vehicle costs less than the grant amount, no sales tax is owed

**100% P&T Disabled Veterans with VA Adaptive Vehicle:**
- Full exemption from sales tax
- Full exemption from registration fees
- Full exemption from local wheel tax
- Annual savings on $35,000 vehicle: $2,450 (one-time) + $30-$60/year registration

**Driver's License Benefits:**

Tennessee does not offer specific fee exemptions for disabled veteran driver's licenses, but the state does issue Disabled Veteran designation on licenses/IDs upon request and verification.

## Sales Tax

- General sales tax: **7% state + local (average 9.46% combined—highest nationally)**
- Vehicle purchases: 7% state (see exemptions above for qualifying disabled veterans)
- Groceries: Taxed at 4% (food is taxed in Tennessee)
- Clothing: Fully taxed

Tennessee has no general sales tax exemption for veterans. However, the state has no income tax, which more than offsets high sales tax for most retirees.

**Example:** Buying a $35,000 truck (non-VA grant recipient):
- In Tennessee (7% sales tax): $2,450 state sales tax
- In Georgia (6.6% average): $2,310
- **Difference: $140 more in TN**

However, that same veteran saves $2,500-$4,000 annually on income tax by living in Tennessee vs. Georgia.

## Overall Tax Analysis

### Annual Tax Savings by Rating

**100% Disabled Veteran (Nashville, $460,000 home, $50,000 military retirement):**
- Property tax relief: $2,500
- Income tax saved (vs. Georgia): $2,875
- **Total Annual Savings vs. Georgia: $5,375**
- **Total savings vs. non-relief TN resident: $2,500 (property relief only)**

**80% Disabled, Military Retiree ($45,000 retirement):**
- Property tax relief: $0 (doesn't qualify)
- Income tax saved (vs. Georgia): $2,588
- **Total annual savings vs. Georgia: $2,588**

**Military Retiree, No Disability ($50,000 retirement):**
- Property tax relief: $0
- Income tax saved (vs. Georgia): $2,875
- **Total annual savings vs. Georgia: $2,875**

The massive benefit in Tennessee is for 100% disabled veterans (property relief + no income tax). Everyone else benefits from no income tax, which is excellent but not exceptional compared to other no-income-tax states.

### 20-Year Savings Projection

**100% Disabled Veteran:**
- Annual savings (vs. Georgia): $5,375
- 20-year total: $107,500
- Net present value (3% discount rate): $80,100

**80% Disabled:**
- Annual savings (vs. Georgia): $2,588
- 20-year total: $51,760
- NPV: $38,500

**Military Retiree (No Disability):**
- Annual savings (vs. Georgia): $2,875
- 20-year total: $57,500
- NPV: $42,800

Over 20 years, a 100% disabled veteran saves over $107,000 compared to living in Georgia. That's substantial.

### Comparison to Neighboring States

| State | Military Retirement Tax | 100% Disabled Property Relief | Annual Savings (100% Disabled, $50K Retirement, $460K Home) |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tennessee** | Exempt (no income tax) | Up to $175,000 assessed value ($2,500+) | $5,375 |
| Georgia | Fully taxed (5.75%) | $60,000 exemption ($1,500) | $1,500 |
| North Carolina | Exempt | $45,000 exemption ($1,200) | $1,200 |
| Kentucky | Partially exempt ($31,110) | $43,300 exemption ($1,300) | $2,350 |
| Virginia | Partially exempt (up to $40K) | Varies by county ($500-$1,500) | $2,000 |
| Alabama | Exempt | $5,000 + homestead ($1,000) | $1,000 |
| Mississippi | Exempt | Varies ($800-$1,500) | $1,500 |
| Arkansas | Partially exempt ($6,000) | Varies ($500-$2,000) | $3,200 |

**Verdict:** Tennessee ranks **#1** among all neighboring states for combined tax benefits (income + property relief), especially for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees.

## State vs National Comparison

- **Income tax treatment:** Top tier—no income tax (tied with 7 other states)
- **Property tax relief:** **Top 15 nationally**—$175,000 assessed value relief is generous
- **Sales tax:** Bottom tier—highest combined rate nationally (9.46%), but offset by no income tax
- **Overall ranking:** **Top 10 nationally** for 100% disabled veterans and military retirees

Studies consistently rank Tennessee in the top 5-10 states for military retirees and top 10 for disabled veterans.

## Who Benefits Most

**Best for:**
- 100% P&T disabled veterans (save $5,000-$7,000+ annually)
- POW veterans (full property tax relief)
- Military retirees with pensions over $40,000 (save $2,500-$5,000 annually on income tax)
- Veterans moving from high-tax states (GA, NC, VA, KY)
- Paraplegic, blind, or double amputee veterans (service-connected)

**Less beneficial for:**
- Veterans rated 50-90% disabled (no property tax relief)
- Veterans without military retirement income (no income tax benefit beyond civilian wages)
- Low-income veterans (property tax relief requires owning home)

**Better options:**
- If you're 70-90% disabled and want property tax relief, consider Texas (full exemption at 100%) or Florida (partial exemptions at lower ratings)
- If you want lower sales tax with no income tax, consider New Hampshire or Alaska

## Additional Financial Benefits

### Estate Tax / Inheritance Tax

- Tennessee estate tax: None (repealed 2016)
- Tennessee inheritance tax: None (repealed 2016)
- Veteran exemptions: N/A (no estate/inheritance taxes)

Tennessee has no estate or inheritance taxes, excellent for estate planning.

### Homestead Tax Relief (Age 65+)

Tennessee offers property tax relief for elderly (age 65+) and disabled homeowners, separate from the veteran program. If you qualify as both elderly/disabled AND as a disabled veteran, check with your County Trustee to maximize benefits.

### Hunting and Fishing Licenses

**Disabled Veteran Hunting/Fishing License:**
- **100% P&T disabled veterans:** Permanent combination hunting/fishing license for **one-time $10 fee**
- **30%+ war-related disability:** Sport fishing and hunting license **free**
- **Annual value:** $150-$200 (regular license cost)

This is an excellent additional benefit for outdoor enthusiasts.

### Other Tax Benefits

**No taxes on:**
- Social Security benefits
- Military retirement
- Pension income
- 401(k)/IRA withdrawals
- Investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains)
- Wages/salaries

**Taxes that do exist:**
- Sales tax: 9.46% average (7% state + local)
- Property tax: 0.58-0.68% effective rate
- Vehicle registration: $26-$60/year (free for qualifying disabled veterans)

## How to Maximize Benefits

**Action Plan:**

1. **Establish Tennessee residency immediately.** Get a TN driver's license, register to vote, file declaration of domicile.

2. **Apply for property tax relief with your County Trustee within 60 days of establishing residency.** Provide DD-214, VA award letter, proof of residency, and property deed. This could save $2,500+ annually—don't delay.

3. **Apply for disabled veteran license plates and free registration if you're 100% P&T.** Contact Tennessee Department of Revenue. Free registration saves $30-$60/year.

4. **Update DFAS withholding.** Stop withholding state income tax if you're coming from another state. Tennessee has no income tax.

5. **Apply for hunting/fishing license if you're 30%+ disabled.** One-time $10 fee (100% P&T) or free (30%+ war-related) for permanent license worth $150-$200/year.

6. **Verify VA automobile grant eligibility if you need adaptive vehicle.** Sales tax exemption on vehicle purchases can save $2,000-$3,000.

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Not applying for property tax relief:** You must apply—it's not automatic. Missing this costs $2,500+/year.

- **Assuming partial disability qualifies:** Only 100% P&T, POW, paraplegic, blind, or loss of use of limbs (service-connected) get property tax relief. If you're 90%, you pay full tax.

- **Not claiming free vehicle registration:** 100% P&T disabled veterans get free registration for one vehicle. Don't pay if you qualify.

- **Paying income tax after moving:** Tennessee has no income tax. Update your W-4/DFAS withholding immediately—don't overpay.

- **Not understanding reimbursement process:** Property tax relief is reimbursement, not exemption. You still pay your tax bill, then get reimbursed by the state. Budget accordingly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I pay state income tax on my military retirement in Tennessee?**

A: No. Tennessee has no state income tax. Military retirement, wages, pensions, Social Security—nothing is taxed at the state level.

**Q: How does Tennessee's property tax relief work for disabled veterans?**

A: It's a reimbursement program, not an exemption. You receive your property tax bill and pay it. Then the state reimburses you for taxes paid on up to $175,000 of assessed value (typically $700,000 market value). You must apply with your County Trustee.

**Q: Can I get property tax relief if I'm 90% disabled?**

A: No, unless you also qualify as a former POW, paraplegic, blind, or have total loss of use of limbs (all service-connected). The relief requires 100% P&T disability or qualifying conditions.

**Q: Does the property tax relief apply to second homes or rental properties?**

A: No. Only your primary residence qualifies.

**Q: I'm 100% P&T. Do I need to reapply every year?**

A: Usually no. Once approved, relief typically renews automatically if your status doesn't change. However, verify with your County Trustee—some counties require periodic recertification.

**Q: Can my surviving spouse keep the property tax relief if I die?**

A: Check with your County Trustee. Some counties allow unremarried surviving spouses to continue receiving relief; others require reapplication or have different criteria.

**Q: I'm a former POW. Do I qualify for property tax relief?**

A: Yes! Former POWs qualify for the same property tax relief as 100% P&T disabled veterans (up to $175,000 assessed value).

**Q: Does Tennessee tax Social Security benefits?**

A: No. Tennessee has no income tax, so Social Security is not taxed.

**Q: I'm active duty stationed in Tennessee but my home of record is Texas. Do I pay TN taxes?**

A: No. Tennessee has no income tax anyway, but even if it did, you'd be protected under SCRA.

**Q: When will I receive my property tax reimbursement?**

A: Timing varies by county. Typically within 30-90 days after you pay your property tax bill and the County Trustee processes the reimbursement request. Check with your local County Trustee for specific timelines.

**Q: Are there local income taxes in Tennessee?**

A: No. There are no state or local income taxes in Tennessee.

**Q: Do I get property tax relief if I'm a Purple Heart recipient but under 100% disabled?**

A: Not specifically. Purple Heart alone doesn't grant relief—you must be 100% P&T, former POW, or meet the service-connected disability criteria (paraplegic, blind, loss of use of limbs).

**Q: How much do I save on sales tax living in Tennessee?**

A: Tennessee actually has the highest combined sales tax nationally (9.46% average). However, having no income tax more than offsets high sales tax for military retirees. A retiree with $50,000 pension saves $2,500-$3,000 annually on income tax vs. neighboring states, far exceeding any extra sales tax paid.

**Q: Can I get both property tax relief and free vehicle registration?**

A: Yes, if you're 100% P&T. You qualify for property tax relief on your home and free registration for one vehicle.

**Q: What if I have a 100% VA rating but it's not P&T?**

A: Check your VA award letter. If you have 100% due to individual unemployability (TDIU), you may still qualify—contact your County Trustee. Otherwise, property tax relief requires P&T status or qualifying service-connected conditions.

**Q: How does Tennessee compare to Florida for veteran tax benefits?**

A: Both have no income tax. Florida offers more generous property tax exemptions for lower disability ratings (partial exemptions at 10%+). Tennessee's relief is limited to 100% P&T but generous ($175,000 assessed value). Overall, Florida edges out Tennessee for disabled veterans rated below 100%, while Tennessee is competitive for 100% disabled and military retirees.
