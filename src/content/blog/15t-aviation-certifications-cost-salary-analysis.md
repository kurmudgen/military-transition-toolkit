## FAQ

**Q: How much military experience do I need to test for A&P?**
A: Minimum 18 months of military aircraft maintenance experience, though 24-36+ months is more typical. The FAA recognizes military 15T experience as equivalent to formal aviation school training.

**Q: Can I get hired without the A&P certificate?**
A: Some regional carriers and maintenance contractors hire mechanics-in-training (A&P students) at lower pay ($38,000-$48,000). However, A&P certification significantly accelerates career and earnings.

**Q: How long does A&P certification take?**
A: For military experience holders, 1-3 months of preparation, then 1-2 weeks for actual testing. Military experience typically bypasses lengthy formal schooling requirements.

**Q: Which type rating should I pursue first?**
A: Boeing 737 is the most common and marketable. About 40% of commercial aircraft are 737s. Airbus A320 is second priority (25% of fleet). This sequence maximizes job opportunities.

**Q: Will my employer pay for type ratings and additional certifications?**
A: Major carriers typically pay or significantly reimburse for first type rating ($5,000-$7,000 average reimbursement). Subsequent certifications may be employee-paid but offer advancement benefits.

**Q: How much can I earn with multiple type ratings?**
A: Mechanics with 2-3 type ratings earn $95,000-$135,000+ annually at major carriers, compared to $65,000-$75,000 for single type rating. Each rating adds job security and earning potential.

**Q: Are there union benefits I should know about?**
A: Most major carrier mechanics are unionized (IAM, TWU). Union contracts guarantee wage progression, benefits, and job security. Average union mechanic earnings are 20-30% higher than non-union roles.

**Q: What's the difference between major carriers and cargo operators in earnings?**
A: Cargo operators (FedEx, UPS) typically pay 15-25% more than passenger carriers due to 24/7 operations and continuous demand. Entry at major carriers, then transition to cargo for higher earnings.

**Q: How long does the A&P remain valid?**
A: The Airman Certificate (A&P license) is valid for life with no renewal required. However, you must maintain current knowledge and currency through actual maintenance work.

**Q: Can I transition to business aviation for higher pay?**
A: Yes. Business aviation (NetJets, Flexjet) pays premium rates ($65,000-$95,000 for A&P certified) for fewer work hours. However, major carriers offer better long-term career progression and benefits.

## Conclusion

For 15T Aviation Mechanics, FAA A&P certification represents the critical gateway to civilian aviation careers. Your military training significantly reduces time and cost to certification—typical break-even is 3-9 months. Strategic pursuit of type ratings (Boeing, Airbus) and manufacturer certifications accelerates earnings to $95,000-$135,000+ within 3 years.

The optimal pathway involves completing A&P certification within 2-3 months, securing a major carrier position, then methodically adding type ratings (one per 6-month period) while building seniority. This approach yields total 3-year earnings increases of $105,000-$180,000+, with lifetime earning increases exceeding $700,000.

**Key Takeaway:** Prioritize A&P certification (2-3 months), then systematically add type ratings and manufacturer certifications while building seniority at a major carrier. Each certification tier increases earnings substantially and improves job security across the aviation industry.

Begin your A&P exam preparation immediately—most 15T mechanics pass with first attempt due to military background. Your path to six-figure earnings is achievable within 4-5 years through strategic certification sequencing.
