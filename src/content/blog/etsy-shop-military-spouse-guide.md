## Success Stories

**Ashley, Army Spouse - Digital Planners**
"I started making PCS planners because I needed one myself. Uploaded to Etsy almost as an afterthought. First month: $200. Now I have 50+ digital planning products and make $3,000-4,000/month in pure profit. When we PCS'd from Texas to Germany, I literally watched sales come in during the plane ride. Zero interruption."

**Maria, Marine Corps Spouse - Military SVGs**
"I create SVG cut files for Cricut—military-themed designs for shirts, signs, mugs. Things like deployment countdowns, funny military spouse quotes, welcome home designs. I know what our community wants because I live it. My shop does $2,500/month and I work maybe 10-15 hours a week. All digital, all portable."

**Jennifer, Navy Spouse - Print-on-Demand**
"Physical crafts were a nightmare with PCS moves. I switched to print-on-demand—my designs on t-shirts, mugs, tote bags. Printful handles everything. I just create designs and optimize listings. $1,800/month now with zero inventory. I can run this shop from anywhere in the world."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "The market is too saturated"
**Reality:** Etsy has 7+ million sellers but 90+ million buyers. Niches within niches exist. Military-themed products from authentic military spouse? Less saturated. The key is standing out through quality, branding, and knowing your audience.

### "I'm not creative enough"
**Solution:** You don't need to be an artist. Template-based products (Canva designs), simple patterns, or curated collections work well. Some top sellers create simple but useful products, not artistic masterpieces.

### "No one will find my shop"
**Solution:** Etsy SEO is learnable. Keywords, tags, and titles matter more than luck. Study what successful shops do. Initial traffic is slow for everyone—consistency wins.

### "I don't know what to sell"
**Solution:** Start with what you know. What do you wish existed for military spouses? What products do you buy repeatedly? What skills do you have? Often the best products come from solving your own problems.

### "What about during deployments?"
**Solution:** Digital products and POD require minimal daily attention. A shop can run with 30 minutes a day of maintenance. During deployment, many spouses actually have MORE time for creative work.

## 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Foundation
- **Week 1:** Research Etsy, choose product type, study competitors

### Days 31-60: Growth
- **Week 5-6:** Add 10-20 more products, experiment with variations
- **Week 7-8:** Analyze what's working, optimize bestsellers, try Etsy ads

### Days 61-90: Scale
- **Week 9-10:** Expand successful product lines, create bundles
- **Week 11-12:** Establish consistent rhythm, plan seasonal products

**Realistic Targets:**
- End of Month 1: Shop live with 20+ products
