# VA Disability Rating for Heart Conditions: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Heart conditions are rated under **Diagnostic Codes 7000-7122** with ratings from **10% to 100%** based on **METs (metabolic equivalents)** testing and symptoms. Common service-connected heart conditions include **coronary artery disease**, **hypertensive heart disease**, **arrhythmias**, and **valvular heart disease**. Veterans with ischemic heart disease who served in Vietnam have **presumptive service connection** under Agent Orange regulations. The key evidence is cardiology evaluation with **METs testing** (exercise or interview-based). Claims typically take 6-12 months due to the need for specialized testing.

## Common Heart Conditions

### Ischemic Heart Disease (DC 7005)
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)
- Angina
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack) history
- **Agent Orange presumptive condition**

### Hypertensive Heart Disease (DC 7007)
- Heart disease caused by chronic high blood pressure
- Enlarged heart (cardiomegaly)
- Heart failure from hypertension

### Arrhythmias (DC 7010-7015)
- Atrial fibrillation (DC 7010)
- Ventricular arrhythmias (DC 7011)
- Heart block (DC 7015)
- Pacemaker/implantable defibrillator

### Valvular Heart Disease (DC 7000)
- Aortic valve disease
- Mitral valve disease
- Valve replacement surgery

### Cardiomyopathy (DC 7020)
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

## VA Rating Criteria

### Understanding METs

**METs (Metabolic Equivalents)** measure how much energy activities require compared to rest:
- **1 MET**: Sitting quietly
- **3-5 METs**: Light housework, walking slowly
- **5-7 METs**: Moderate activities, climbing stairs
- **7-10 METs**: Vigorous activities, running
- **10+ METs**: Strenuous exercise

**Lower METs = worse heart function = higher rating**

### General Rating Formula for Heart Disease

Most heart conditions (DC 7005, 7007, 7017, 7020) use this formula:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Workload of greater than 7 METs but not greater than 10 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR continuous medication required |
| **30%** | Workload of greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation on ECG, echocardiogram, or X-ray |
| **60%** | More than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in past year; OR workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 30-50% |
| **100%** | Chronic congestive heart failure; OR workload of 3 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 30% |

### Arrhythmias (DC 7010-7011)

**Supraventricular Arrhythmias (DC 7010):**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Permanent atrial fibrillation (lone atrial fibrillation) or one to four episodes per year of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardia documented by ECG or Holter monitor |
| **30%** | Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardia with more than 4 episodes per year documented by ECG or Holter monitor |

**Ventricular Arrhythmias (DC 7011):**

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Workload of greater than 7 METs but not greater than 10 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR continuous medication or pacemaker required |
| **30%** | Workload of greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope |
| **60%** | More than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in past year; OR workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 30-50% |
| **100%** | Chronic congestive heart failure; OR workload of 3 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; OR left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 30%; OR implantable automatic cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) in place |

### Implantable Cardiac Devices

- **Pacemaker**: Minimum 10% rating plus evaluation under appropriate diagnostic code
- **AICD (Implantable Defibrillator)**: Automatic 100% rating under DC 7011

### Coronary Bypass Surgery

- **100%** for 3 months following hospital discharge
- Then rated based on residual symptoms using METs criteria

### Heart Valve Replacement

- **100%** for one year following implantation
- Then rated based on residual symptoms (minimum 10% if continuous anticoagulation required)

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence

**For Agent Orange presumptive (Ischemic Heart Disease):**
- DD-214 showing Vietnam service or other qualifying location
- Diagnosis of ischemic heart disease
- No nexus letter required for presumptive

**For direct service connection:**
- Service treatment records showing cardiac symptoms
- In-service documentation of heart problems
- Nexus opinion linking current condition to service

**For secondary service connection:**
- Service-connected condition causing heart disease
- Nexus opinion (common secondary to hypertension, diabetes, PTSD, obesity)

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Cardiology evaluation
- Echocardiogram (showing ejection fraction)
- ECG/EKG
- Stress test or METs interview
- Cardiac catheterization results (if applicable)
- Hospital records (if heart attack, surgery)

### Severity Evidence
- METs testing results (exercise or interview-based)
- Ejection fraction measurements
- Documentation of symptoms
- Hospitalization records
- Medication list

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review cardiac history
2. Review all diagnostic testing
3. Conduct physical examination
4. Perform METs assessment (exercise test or interview-based)
5. Review medications
6. Assess functional limitations

**METs Assessment:**
The examiner will determine your METs level either by:
- **Exercise stress test** (most accurate)
- **Interview-based METs** (if exercise test not possible)

**Tell the examiner:**
- All symptoms you experience
- What activities cause symptoms
- How far you can walk
- How many stairs you can climb
- History of hospitalizations
- All cardiac events

**Important:** Be honest about your limitations. Don't overstate OR understate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is coronary artery disease presumptive for Vietnam veterans?
Yes. Ischemic heart disease (including coronary artery disease, angina, and heart attacks) is presumptively service-connected for veterans exposed to Agent Orange.

### What if I can't do an exercise stress test?
The VA can use interview-based METs assessment if you cannot perform an exercise stress test due to other conditions.

### Can I claim heart disease secondary to hypertension?
Yes. Hypertensive heart disease is commonly claimed secondary to service-connected hypertension. Long-term high blood pressure damages the heart.

### What's the rating for a pacemaker?
A pacemaker guarantees a minimum 10% rating, plus evaluation based on the underlying condition and METs level.

### What about an implantable defibrillator (AICD)?
An AICD automatically qualifies for 100% under DC 7011, regardless of METs testing.

### Can PTSD cause heart disease?
Yes. Chronic stress from PTSD is linked to cardiovascular disease. You can claim heart conditions secondary to service-connected PTSD with a nexus opinion.

### What happens after heart surgery?
- **Bypass surgery**: 100% for 3 months, then rated on residuals
- **Valve replacement**: 100% for 1 year, then rated on residuals (minimum 10% if on anticoagulation)

## Common Denial Reasons and Appeals

### Denial Reasons
1. METs testing shows greater than 10 METs
2. No nexus to service (for non-presumptive claims)
3. Condition attributed to non-service factors
4. Insufficient medical documentation

### Appeal Strategies
- Get private METs testing if VA testing seems inaccurate
- Obtain nexus letter from cardiologist
- Document all symptoms and functional limitations
- Request independent medical opinion
