# VA Rating for Hypertension: Blood Pressure Ratings Explained (2025)

Hypertension (high blood pressure) is one of the most common conditions among veterans—and one of the most underrated VA disabilities. If your high blood pressure is connected to military service, you may be entitled to disability compensation from 10% to 60%.

But here's what many veterans don't know: hypertension is incredibly strong as a secondary claim, especially secondary to PTSD, sleep apnea, or kidney conditions. Let's break down everything you need to know.

## How the VA Rates Hypertension

The VA rates hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101 based on your blood pressure readings, specifically your diastolic (bottom number) and systolic (top number) readings.

### Hypertension Rating Criteria

| Rating | Monthly Pay (2025) | Blood Pressure Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **10%** | $175.51 | Diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, OR systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, OR minimum evaluation for individual with history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control |
| **20%** | $357.03 | Diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, OR systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more |
| **40%** | $755.28 | Diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more |
| **60%** | $1,110.55 | Diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more |

### Understanding the Criteria

**Key term: "Predominantly"**
This means most of your readings, not all. If you have 10 readings and 6 of them show diastolic 100+, that qualifies for 10%.

**What counts:**
- Regular doctor visit readings
- VA clinic readings
- Emergency room visits
- Home monitoring logs (if consistent)

**10% rating** is most common. You qualify if:
- Your diastolic is predominantly 100+ OR
- Your systolic is predominantly 160+ OR
- You have history of high BP requiring continuous medication

**Important**: That last criterion is huge. If you're on blood pressure medication to control your hypertension, you qualify for minimum 10% even if your current readings are normal (because medication is controlling it).

### Reading Blood Pressure Numbers

Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic (like 140/90):
- **Systolic** (top number): Pressure when heart beats
- **Diastolic** (bottom number): Pressure between beats

For VA rating purposes:
- Diastolic 100+ = 10%
- Diastolic 110+ = 20%
- Diastolic 120+ = 40%
- Diastolic 130+ = 60%

OR

- Systolic 160+ = 10%
- Systolic 200+ = 20%

## Secondary Service Connection: The Strongest Path

Most veterans get hypertension service-connected through secondary claims. Here are the most successful connections:

### PTSD/Anxiety → Hypertension

**This is the gold standard secondary hypertension claim.**

Medical basis:
- Chronic stress increases cortisol and adrenaline
- Elevated stress hormones constrict blood vessels
- Sustained "fight or flight" response raises BP
- Well-documented in medical literature

If you're rated for PTSD or anxiety, hypertension secondary to that condition is highly winnable with proper nexus.

### Sleep Apnea → Hypertension

Very strong connection:
- Repeated oxygen drops during sleep stress cardiovascular system
- Sleep apnea is independent risk factor for hypertension
- Multiple studies support the connection

If you're rated 50% for sleep apnea (CPAP use), consider adding hypertension as secondary.

### Diabetes → Hypertension

Common combination:
- Diabetes damages blood vessels
- Many diabetics develop hypertension
- Often seen together in same patient

### Kidney Conditions → Hypertension

Strong medical connection:
- Kidney disease directly causes hypertension
- Hypertension can also cause kidney disease (bidirectional)
- If you have kidney damage, hypertension is likely secondary

### Obesity from Service-Connected Conditions → Hypertension

If you gained weight due to:
- Inability to exercise (orthopedic conditions)
- Medications for service-connected conditions
- Mental health conditions affecting activity

Weight gain is a major risk factor for hypertension.

### Agent Orange Exposure → Hypertension

**As of 2022, hypertension is now presumptive for Agent Orange exposure.**

If you served in:
- Vietnam (1962-1975)
- Korean DMZ (1968-1971)
- Thailand (certain bases)
- Other Agent Orange locations

You qualify for presumptive service connection for hypertension—no nexus needed.

## Proving Service Connection

### Presumptive (Agent Orange Veterans)

If you have qualifying Agent Orange exposure:
1. File claim for hypertension
2. VA verifies your service location
3. No nexus letter required
4. Service connection presumed

### Direct Service Connection

To prove hypertension is directly connected to service:

**Evidence needed:**
1. Current diagnosis of hypertension
2. In-service evidence of elevated blood pressure
3. Nexus connecting current condition to service

**In-service evidence:**
- Medical records showing elevated readings during service
- Documentation of treatment or medication
- Physical exam results
- Line of duty determinations

**Reality check**: Many service members had borderline high BP during service that wasn't formally diagnosed. Look for any readings in records that were elevated.

### Secondary Service Connection

For secondary claims:

1. Current diagnosis of hypertension
2. Already service-connected for primary condition (PTSD, sleep apnea, etc.)
3. Nexus opinion explaining the connection
4. Medical literature supporting the link

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Current diagnosis** of hypertension
2. **Blood pressure log** showing readings over time
3. **Medication records** showing continuous treatment
4. **Lab work** related to hypertension (kidney function, etc.)
5. **Any complications** (heart disease, kidney damage, stroke history)

### For Secondary Claims

6. **Documentation of primary condition** severity
7. **Nexus letter** explaining how primary condition causes hypertension
8. **Medical literature** supporting the connection

### Lay Evidence

9. **Personal statement** describing:
   - When hypertension was diagnosed
   - Connection to service or service-connected condition
   - How it affects your life
   - Medication requirements

10. **Buddy statements** if applicable

## C&P Exam for Hypertension

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about medical history
3. **Take blood pressure readings** (usually multiple)
4. Review medication history
5. Assess any complications
6. Provide nexus opinion

### Important About C&P Blood Pressure Readings

The examiner will take your blood pressure. Here's what to know:

**"White coat hypertension"**: Some people have higher readings in medical settings due to anxiety. If your readings at the exam are higher than usual, that's actually helpful for your claim.

**Home readings matter**: If you have documented home readings showing elevated BP, bring that log.

**Don't try to manipulate**: Just be yourself. Drink your normal amount of caffeine, take your medications as prescribed. The VA looks at the whole picture, not just one exam.

### Questions You'll Be Asked

- When were you diagnosed with hypertension?
- What medications do you take?
- What are your typical blood pressure readings?
- Have you had any complications (heart problems, kidney problems, stroke)?
- (For secondary claims) How do you think your [primary condition] affects your blood pressure?

### What to Bring

- List of all blood pressure medications
- Home blood pressure log if you have one
- Records of any hypertension complications
- Lab results (kidney function, etc.)

## Hypertension Secondary Conditions

If your hypertension is service-connected, these conditions may be secondary TO it:

### Heart Disease
- Hypertension damages the heart over time
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart failure
- Rated 10-100% depending on severity

### Kidney Disease
- High BP damages kidney blood vessels
- Chronic kidney disease
- Rated under renal diagnostic codes

### Stroke
- Hypertension is major stroke risk factor
- Rated based on residuals

### Vision Problems
- Hypertensive retinopathy
- High BP damages blood vessels in eyes

### Erectile Dysfunction
- Hypertension and BP medications both cause ED
- ED rated 0% but qualifies for SMC-K ($131.64/month)

## Common Denial Reasons and Solutions

### "Blood pressure readings don't meet criteria"
**Solution**:
- Gather all historical readings, not just recent ones
- If on medication, 10% is the minimum with continuous medication requirement
- Appeal with comprehensive BP log

### "No nexus to service"
**Solution**:
- For secondary claims, get nexus letter explaining connection
- For Agent Orange veterans, verify presumptive eligibility
- For direct claims, review all service treatment records for any elevated readings

### "Attributed to lifestyle factors"
**Solution**:
- If service-connected conditions caused lifestyle changes (can't exercise, weight gain), document that chain
- Get medical opinion addressing non-service factors

### "Condition controlled by medication"
**Solution**:
- Point to rating criteria: continuous medication requirement = minimum 10%
- "Controlled" doesn't mean "not compensable"

## Tips for Maximizing Your Rating

### Track Your Blood Pressure

Keep a detailed log:
- Date and time
- Reading (systolic/diastolic)
- Any symptoms
- Medications taken

This creates a record showing your "predominant" readings.

### Document Medication History

List every blood pressure medication you've ever taken:
- Name
- Dosage
- Duration
- Why it was changed (didn't work? side effects?)

Multiple medication trials suggest difficult-to-control hypertension.

### Get Complications Evaluated

If you have any complications from hypertension:
- Heart problems
- Kidney issues
- Vision changes
- History of stroke

These can be rated separately as secondary to hypertension.

### Consider Combined Claims

Hypertension + heart disease + kidney issues can result in significant combined rating even though hypertension alone caps at 60%.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get 10% just for taking blood pressure medication?
Yes. If you require continuous medication to control hypertension, you qualify for minimum 10% even if your current readings are controlled.

### What if my BP is normal at the C&P exam?
Your rating is based on "predominant" readings, not a single exam. Bring your BP log showing typical readings. Also, if you're on medication, the fact that it's controlled doesn't disqualify you.

### Is hypertension presumptive for Gulf War veterans?
Not currently under Gulf War presumptives, but it is presumptive for Agent Orange exposure. For Gulf War vets, secondary to PTSD is often the best path.

### Can I claim hypertension secondary to anxiety?
Yes. Anxiety and stress directly affect blood pressure. If you're service-connected for anxiety, hypertension secondary is very winnable.

### What's the difference between hypertension and high blood pressure?
They're the same thing. Hypertension is the medical term for chronically elevated blood pressure.

### Can hypertension medication side effects be rated?
Potentially. If BP medication causes erectile dysfunction, that's ratable. Other significant side effects may also be compensable.

## 2025 Compensation Rates

| Rating | Veteran Alone | With Spouse | With Spouse + Child |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 10% | $175.51 | $175.51 | $175.51 |
| 20% | $357.03 | $398.03 | $436.03 |
| 40% | $755.28 | $838.28 | $897.28 |
| 60% | $1,110.55 | $1,204.55 | $1,273.55 |

## Bottom Line

Hypertension is a legitimate, compensable condition that's especially strong as a secondary claim. If you're already rated for PTSD, sleep apnea, diabetes, or kidney conditions, hypertension should be on your radar.

Key steps:
1. Get diagnosed and treated for hypertension
2. Track your blood pressure readings
3. Identify your best service connection path (secondary usually wins)
4. Get nexus letter for secondary claims
5. Document medication requirements
6. Consider secondary conditions FROM hypertension (heart, kidneys)

Your high blood pressure is connected to your service. Get compensated.
