# VA Rating for Hip Pain: Compensation and Secondary Conditions (2025)

Hip pain from military service can significantly impact your daily life—from difficulty walking to problems sleeping. The VA provides disability ratings from 0% to 90% for hip conditions, with the potential for even higher combined ratings when you factor in secondary conditions and bilateral involvement.

This guide covers everything you need to know about getting proper compensation for your hip condition.

## How the VA Rates Hip Conditions

The VA rates hip disabilities under several Diagnostic Codes depending on your specific condition:

### Diagnostic Codes for Hip Conditions

| Code | Condition | Rating Range |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **5250** | Hip ankylosis (fused joint) | 60-90% |
| **5251** | Limitation of thigh extension | 10% |
| **5252** | Limitation of thigh flexion | 10-40% |
| **5253** | Impairment of thigh (rotation, adduction, abduction) | 10-20% |
| **5254** | Hip flail joint | 80% |
| **5255** | Impairment of femur | 10-80% |

### Range of Motion Ratings (Most Common)

**Limitation of Thigh Flexion (DC 5252)**

| Flexion Limited To | Rating |
|-------------------|--------|
| 45° | 10% |
| 30° | 20% |
| 20° | 30% |
| 10° | 40% |

Normal hip flexion is 125°. The more limited your flexion, the higher your rating.

**Limitation of Thigh Extension (DC 5251)**

| Extension Limited To | Rating |
|---------------------|--------|
| 5° | 10% |

Normal hip extension is 0°. If you can't extend to neutral, you get 10%.

**Limitation of Thigh Rotation/Adduction (DC 5253)**

| Limitation | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Cannot cross legs | 10% |
| Cannot toe-out more than 15° | 10% |
| Limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10° | 20% |

### Hip Replacement Rating (DC 5054)

Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) is rated under its own code:

| Status | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| For 1 year following implantation | 100% |
| With chronic residuals (painful motion, weakness) | 70% |
| With intermediate degrees of residuals | 50% |
| Minimum rating after replacement | 30% |

**Important**: After hip replacement, you get 100% for one year, then the VA re-evaluates. Most veterans settle at 30-70% depending on residual symptoms.

### Ankylosis (DC 5250)

If your hip is fused/immobile:

| Position | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Favorable angle (flexion 20-40°, slight adduction or abduction) | 60% |
| Intermediate ankylosis | 70% |
| Unfavorable (extreme position) | 90% |

## The Bilateral Factor

If both hips are service-connected, the VA adds the **bilateral factor**—a 10% increase to the combined value of bilateral disabilities affecting paired limbs.

**Example:**
- Right hip: 20%
- Left hip: 10%
- Combined before bilateral factor: 28%
- After bilateral factor: 28% + 2.8% (10% of 28) = 30.8% → rounds to 31%

This can significantly increase your overall rating.

## Proving Service Connection

### Direct Service Connection

For direct connection, you need:

1. **Current hip diagnosis** (from X-ray, MRI, or physical exam)
2. **In-service event, injury, or condition**:
   - Hip injury documented in service records
   - Repetitive stress (rucking, running, jumping)
   - Training injuries
   - Vehicle accidents
3. **Nexus** connecting current condition to service

**Common in-service causes:**
- Airborne operations (parachuting)
- Infantry rucking with heavy loads
- Vehicle accidents (especially IED blasts)
- Training injuries
- Running on hard surfaces
- Slips and falls

### Secondary Service Connection

Hip conditions are often secondary to other service-connected disabilities:

**Back Conditions → Hip Pain**
- Altered gait from back pain stresses hips
- Compensating for back injury affects hip mechanics
- Very common secondary claim

**Knee Conditions → Hip Pain**
- Changed walking pattern to protect knee
- Places abnormal stress on hip joint
- Well-documented connection

**Ankle/Foot Conditions → Hip Pain**
- Altered biomechanics from lower extremity conditions
- Chain reaction up the leg

**Leg Length Discrepancy → Hip Pain**
- One leg shorter (from injury, fracture, or surgery)
- Causes hip joint stress

**Obesity from Other Conditions → Hip Pain**
- Weight gain from inability to exercise
- Excess weight degrades hip joint

## Evidence You Need

### Medical Evidence

1. **Current diagnosis** with imaging:
   - X-rays showing osteoarthritis, joint space narrowing
   - MRI showing labral tears, cartilage damage
   - Bone scan if stress fractures suspected

2. **Treatment records** showing ongoing care:
   - Physical therapy notes
   - Medication prescriptions
   - Surgical consultations or procedures
   - Joint injections

3. **Range of motion measurements**:
   - From physical therapist or orthopedic doctor
   - Documented in degrees
   - Include painful motion notation

### Service Records

4. **In-service documentation**:
   - Injury reports
   - Sick call visits for hip pain
   - Physical therapy during service
   - Limited duty profiles
   - Jump log (airborne)
   - MOS-related activities

### Lay Evidence

5. **Personal statement**:
   - Describe how injury occurred
   - Symptoms experienced during service
   - Current symptoms and limitations
   - Impact on daily activities

6. **Buddy statements**:
   - Witnessed injury or ongoing symptoms
   - Description of your limitations
   - Before/after comparison

### For Secondary Claims

7. **Nexus letter** explaining:
   - How primary condition affects gait/biomechanics
   - Medical rationale for connection
   - Literature supporting the link

## C&P Exam for Hip Conditions

### What the Examiner Will Do

1. Review your claims file
2. Ask about medical history and symptoms
3. **Measure range of motion** (critical)
4. Test for pain during movement
5. Check for instability
6. Assess functional impairment

### Range of Motion Testing

The examiner will measure:
- **Flexion** (bending hip, bringing knee to chest)
- **Extension** (moving leg backward)
- **Abduction** (moving leg outward)
- **Adduction** (moving leg inward)
- **External rotation** (rotating foot outward)
- **Internal rotation** (rotating foot inward)

**Critical**: The examiner must document where pain begins during motion. Your rating can be based on where pain limits motion, not just where physical motion ends.

### The DeLuca Factors

Under DeLuca v. Brown, the VA must consider:
- Pain on movement
- Weakness
- Fatigue
- Lack of endurance
- Incoordination
- Flare-ups

**Always mention flare-ups**. If your hip is worse some days, describe:
- How often flare-ups occur
- How long they last
- What causes them
- How they affect your function

### What to Tell the Examiner

**Describe your worst days:**
- "During flare-ups, I can barely walk to the bathroom"
- "After prolonged sitting, my hip locks up"
- "I use a cane on bad days"

**Don't push through pain:**
- Stop movement when pain begins, not when you physically can't move
- Say "that's where the pain stops me"
- Don't try to impress the examiner

**Mention all symptoms:**
- Pain
- Stiffness
- Grinding/clicking
- Giving way
- Sleep disruption
- Need for assistive devices

### What to Bring

- List of current symptoms
- Notes on flare-up frequency and triggers
- Assistive devices you use (cane, walker)
- Medical records if not in VA system
- Buddy statements

## Secondary Conditions FROM Hip Pain

If your hip is service-connected, consider claiming:

### Back Pain (Lumbar Strain)
- Altered gait from hip pain stresses lower back
- Very common secondary
- Rated 10-40% for limitation of motion

### Knee Pain
- Hip mechanics affect knee alignment
- Compensating for hip creates knee stress

### Radiculopathy
- Hip position can affect nerve compression
- If you have shooting pain down leg, document it

### Depression/Anxiety
- Chronic pain affects mental health
- Rated under mental health criteria

### Obesity
- Inability to exercise leads to weight gain
- Weight gain worsens joint conditions (cycle continues)

### Erectile Dysfunction
- Hip pain and medications can affect sexual function
- ED is rated 0% but qualifies for SMC-K ($131.64/month)

## Increasing Your Hip Rating

### When to File for Increase

- Condition has worsened since last rating
- New imaging shows progression
- Range of motion has decreased
- You've had surgery
- Flare-ups are more frequent/severe
- You now use assistive devices

### Tips for Higher Rating

1. **Document range of motion decline** - Get new measurements from your doctor
2. **Describe flare-ups in detail** - Frequency, duration, severity
3. **Note functional impairment** - What can't you do anymore?
4. **Get current imaging** - Shows arthritis progression
5. **Update buddy statements** - Current impact on daily life

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get ratings for both hips?

Yes. Each hip is rated separately, and if both are service-connected, you get the bilateral factor (10% boost).

### What if my hip pain is from arthritis?

Arthritis is rated based on limitation of motion it causes. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the hip is compensable if service-connected.

### Is hip bursitis ratable?

Yes. Hip bursitis is typically rated under the limitation of motion codes based on how it affects your movement.

### What if I need a hip replacement?

You'll be rated at 100% for one year post-surgery, then re-evaluated. Most veterans receive 30-70% after.

### Can I claim hip pain secondary to back pain?

Absolutely. Altered gait and biomechanics from back conditions commonly cause hip problems. Get a nexus letter explaining the connection.

### What's the average hip rating?

Most veterans receive 10-20% for hip conditions. Higher ratings (30-40%) require significant range of motion loss.

## 2025 Compensation Rates

| Rating | Veteran Alone | With Spouse | With Spouse + Child |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 10% | $175.51 | $175.51 | $175.51 |
| 20% | $357.03 | $398.03 | $436.03 |

## Bottom Line

Hip pain affects everything—walking, sleeping, working, enjoying life. The VA recognizes this and provides compensation for service-connected hip conditions.

Key steps:
1. Get current imaging (X-ray/MRI)
2. Document range of motion limitations
3. Establish service connection (secondary often works)
4. Don't minimize pain during C&P exam
5. Claim secondary conditions
6. Consider bilateral factor if both hips affected

Your hip pain is real. You deserve compensation.
