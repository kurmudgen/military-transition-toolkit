# Jobs That Require Security Clearances: Maximize Your Military Advantage

## Bottom Line Up Front

Your security clearance is worth **$10,000-$30,000+ in salary premium**. It takes 6-12+ months and $5,000-$50,000 for employers to sponsor a new clearance—you already have one. **Don't let it lapse.** The defense, intelligence, and government contracting industries desperately need cleared workers. If you have a clearance, you have a significant competitive advantage in the job market.

## Understanding Security Clearances

### Clearance Levels

**Confidential:**
- Lowest level
- Most common
- 15-year reinvestigation cycle

**Secret:**
- Most widely held clearance
- Access to classified information
- 10-year reinvestigation cycle

**Top Secret (TS):**
- Access to information that could cause "exceptionally grave damage"
- 5-year reinvestigation cycle
- Requires more extensive background investigation

**Top Secret/SCI (TS/SCI):**
- Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information
- Additional access beyond standard TS
- Requires polygraph for some positions

### Clearance Value to Employers

| Clearance | Sponsorship Cost | Processing Time | Your Advantage |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Secret | $5,000-$10,000 | 4-8 months | Medium |
| Top Secret | $15,000-$30,000 | 8-15 months | High |
| TS/SCI | $30,000-$50,000+ | 12-18+ months | Very High |

**The math:** An employer can hire you immediately vs. waiting 6-18 months and paying $15K+ to clear someone else. You're significantly more attractive.

## Salary Premiums for Cleared Positions

Cleared positions typically pay more than equivalent non-cleared roles:

| Role | Without Clearance | With Secret | With TS/SCI |
|------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| IT Specialist | $65,000 | $75,000 | $90,000+ |
| Analyst | $55,000 | $70,000 | $85,000+ |
| Engineer | $80,000 | $95,000 | $115,000+ |
| Project Manager | $75,000 | $90,000 | $105,000+ |

**Clearance premiums range from 10-35%** depending on role and clearance level.

## Keeping Your Clearance Active

### The Critical Window

Your clearance status after separation:

**Active clearance:** Currently sponsored by employer
**Current clearance:** Left sponsor but within "grace period"

**Grace periods:**
- After leaving: Your clearance becomes "current" (not active)
- Secret: Good for 2 years
- Top Secret: Good for 2 years
- After grace period: Investigation must be repeated (you lose the advantage)

**Key:** Get hired into a cleared position before your grace period expires.

### Reinstatement vs. New Investigation

If you get a cleared job within the grace period:
- New employer sponsors/activates your clearance
- No new investigation required (usually)
- Process takes weeks, not months

If you wait too long:
- Full investigation required
- Takes months
- Employer may choose someone already cleared

### What to Do If Separating

1. **Identify your clearance status** and grace period end date
2. **Target cleared positions** in your job search
3. **Prioritize clearance-required jobs** if timeline is tight
4. **Get hired before grace period expires**

2. **Search cleared job boards** for matching positions
3. **Apply with clearance level** prominently noted
4. **In interviews, confirm your clearance is active/current**
5. **Get hired while clearance is valid**

## Reporting Requirements

### Maintaining Your Clearance

While cleared, you must report:
- Foreign contacts
- Foreign travel
- Financial issues
- Legal issues
- Changes in personal status
- Security incidents

### After Separation

Keep your records:
- Know your investigation date
- Know your clearance level
- Have documentation if possible
- SF-86 information (for reinstatement)

## Common Questions

### Can I tell employers I have a clearance?

Yes. Your clearance level (Secret, TS, TS/SCI) is not classified. You can and should include it on your resume and LinkedIn.

### How do I prove I have a clearance?

Employers verify through official channels (DISS/JPAS). You provide your full name and SSN; they verify.

### What if my clearance is expired?

If within 2 years, reinstatement is usually straightforward. Beyond 2 years, you may need a new investigation, but prior clearance history helps.

### Can I get a clearance as a civilian?

Yes, but employers must sponsor you. It's expensive and time-consuming for them, so having an existing clearance is a major advantage.

### Will my clearance transfer between contractors?

Yes. Your clearance "travels" with you. New employer picks up sponsorship.
