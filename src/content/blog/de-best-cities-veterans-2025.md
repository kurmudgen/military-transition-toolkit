# Delaware Military Retirement: Best Cities, Housing Costs & Quality of Life

Delaware is America's second-smallest state—you can drive from its northern border to its southern beaches in 90 minutes. But packed into those 96 miles are three distinctly different regions: the Philadelphia-influenced north, the state capital center, and the beach resort south.

For veterans, Delaware offers an unusual proposition: **zero sales tax**, some of the nation's lowest property tax rates, full property tax exemption for 100% disabled veterans, strategic Mid-Atlantic location, and beach access—all without the crushing housing costs of neighboring New Jersey or Maryland's urban areas.

So where should you actually live in Delaware? This isn't a Chamber of Commerce promotional piece. This is a realistic assessment of which Delaware cities make sense for veterans, and which ones will cost you more than the benefits are worth.

## Bottom Line Up Front

**Most affordable for veterans**: Dover, Middletown, Smyrna, Georgetown
**Best military community**: Dover (Dover AFB area)
**Best VA healthcare access**: Wilmington, Newark (direct access to VA Medical Center)
**Best job opportunities**: Wilmington (finance), Dover (state government/Dover AFB), commute to Philadelphia
**Best overall value**: Dover, Middletown
**Best beach retirement**: Lewes (affordable beach option)

**Reality check**: Delaware has only 3 counties and limited geographic diversity. Your realistic choices are: northern Delaware (Wilmington/Newark area, expensive but near Philadelphia jobs), central Delaware (Dover area, affordable and military-friendly), or southern Delaware (beach towns, mixed costs).

**Median home price range**: $262,000 (Dover) to $1,300,000+ (Rehoboth Beach)
**State median**: ~$300,000-$350,000

**Delaware's advantage**: Even "expensive" Delaware costs less than comparable areas in New Jersey, Maryland, or Pennsylvania—and you pay zero sales tax and minimal property taxes.

## The Delaware Veteran Profile

Before ranking cities, understand Delaware's veteran landscape.

**Total veterans**: ~61,454 (7.5% of population)
**Veteran-friendly ranking**: Delaware consistently ranks in top 20 states for veterans
**Average veteran age**: 60+ (older veteran population, many retirees)

**Why veterans choose Delaware**:
1. Strategic location (DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, NYC all accessible)
2. Zero sales tax (save thousands annually)
3. Low property taxes (0.43-0.55% average vs. 2%+ in NJ)
4. Beach access without Florida humidity
5. Small state (short commutes, everything accessible)
6. No vehicle property tax

**Why some veterans leave Delaware**:
1. Small state limits options (only 3 counties)
2. Limited defense contractor presence (must commute to MD/PA/DC)
3. Higher housing costs than Southern states
4. Cold winters (not Sun Belt)
5. Limited military installations (only Dover AFB)

## Top Cities/Areas for Veterans in Delaware

## The Harsh Reality: Can You Actually Afford Delaware?

Let's run real numbers for typical veteran scenarios.

### Scenario 1: E-7 Retiree, 100% Disabled, Single

**Income**:
- Military retirement: $32,000/year
- VA disability (100%): $3,946/month = $47,352/year
- **Total**: $79,352/year

**Can afford** (using 28% housing cost ratio):
- Maximum housing payment: $1,850/month
- Affordable home price: ~$350,000 (with VA loan, zero down)

**Delaware cities you can afford**:
- **Dover**: $262K-$335K ✓ (comfortably)
- **Georgetown**: $280K-$320K ✓ (comfortably)
- **Smyrna**: $300K-$380K ✓ (barely, at lower end)
- **Wilmington**: $295K-$327K ✓ (barely, at lower end)
- **Middletown**: $407K-$520K ✗ (too expensive)
- **Newark**: $365K-$390K ✗ (too expensive)
- **Lewes**: $400K-$600K ✗ (too expensive)

**Reality**: You can afford Dover, Georgetown, and lower-end Wilmington/Smyrna. Middletown, Newark, and beach towns are out of reach.

### Scenario 2: O-4 Retiree, 70% Disabled, Married, Dual Income

**Income**:
- Military retirement: $50,000/year
- VA disability (70% with dependents): $2,000/month = $24,000/year

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dover offers best overall value for veterans** - Affordable housing, military community, state/federal jobs, VA clinic, lowest cost of living

2. **Middletown best for families with kids** - Top schools, safe suburbs, Amazon employment, but expensive ($400K-$520K)

3. **100% disabled veterans eliminate property taxes entirely** - Saves $1,000-$3,000+/year depending on location; huge benefit

4. **Zero sales tax benefits everyone** - Save $3,000-$4,000/year vs. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland

5. **Commuting to Philadelphia/Baltimore expands options** - Live in Delaware, work in higher-wage markets, keep Delaware tax advantages

6. **Dover AFB drives military culture** - Kent County (Dover area) has strongest military community in Delaware

7. **Small state = limited choices** - Only 3 counties; if you need geographic diversity, Delaware isn't for you

8. **Beach towns expensive** - Lewes ($400K-$600K) barely affordable; Rehoboth ($1M+) out of reach for most veterans

9. **Most veterans can afford Dover, Georgetown, Smyrna** - At $260K-$380K, these cities work on military retirement + VA disability alone

10. **Dual income or civilian job required for Wilmington/Newark/Middletown** - At $365K-$520K, these cities need additional income beyond military retirement

The bottom line: Delaware works exceptionally well for veterans who:
- Are 100% disabled (property tax exemption + school tax credit = massive savings)
- Want Mid-Atlantic location without Mid-Atlantic costs
- Value zero sales tax (saves thousands annually)
- Prefer small state with short commutes
- Are willing to live in Dover/Kent County for affordability + military community

Delaware won't work for veterans who:
- Need robust defense contractor job market (limited in-state; must commute)
- Want large state with geographic variety (Delaware is tiny)
- Need warm weather year-round (Delaware has cold winters)
- Are on fixed income and need beach living (only affordable if you avoid Rehoboth)
