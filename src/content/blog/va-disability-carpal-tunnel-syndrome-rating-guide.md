# VA Disability Rating for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is rated under **Diagnostic Code 8515** (median nerve) with ratings from **10% to 70%** depending on severity and which hand is affected. **Dominant hand receives higher ratings**. Most veterans receive **10-30%** per affected hand. CTS is common from military duties involving repetitive hand motions (typing, weapons maintenance, mechanical work). Each hand is rated separately. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome occurs when the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist.

**Symptoms:**
- Numbness and tingling in thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers
- Pain in wrist and hand
- Weakness in hand and grip
- Tendency to drop things
- Symptoms worse at night
- Symptoms aggravated by repetitive activities

**Military causes:**
- **Repetitive motions**: Typing, data entry, driving
- **Weapons maintenance**: Cleaning, assembly
- **Mechanical work**: Using tools, equipment repair
- **Vibration exposure**: Operating vehicles, equipment
- **Physical training**: Pushups, weight lifting
- **Combat**: Gripping weapons, carrying loads

## VA Rating Criteria

CTS is rated under **38 CFR § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8515** (Median Nerve):

| Severity | Major (Dominant) | Minor (Non-Dominant) |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Mild** | 10% | 10% |
| **Moderate** | 30% | 20% |
| **Severe** | 50% | 40% |
| **Complete paralysis** | 70% | 60% |

### Understanding Severity

**Mild:**
- Intermittent numbness/tingling
- Minimal weakness
- Minor functional impairment

**Moderate:**
- Regular numbness/tingling
- Noticeable grip weakness
- Difficulty with fine motor tasks
- Symptoms affecting daily activities

**Severe:**
- Constant symptoms
- Significant weakness
- Muscle wasting (thenar atrophy)
- Major functional impairment

**Complete paralysis:**
- Total loss of median nerve function
- Unable to grip with thumb
- Loss of sensation in affected fingers

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing hand/wrist complaints
- MOS involving repetitive hand use
- Documentation of duties requiring hand motions
- Buddy statements about work activities

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- EMG/Nerve Conduction Study (gold standard)
- Orthopedic or neurological evaluation
- Physical examination showing:
  - Positive Phalen's test
  - Positive Tinel's sign
  - Sensory deficits

### Severity Evidence
- EMG results showing severity
- Documented weakness
- Treatment records (splints, injections, surgery)
- Functional limitations

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Perform Phalen's test (wrist flexion)
2. Perform Tinel's sign (tap over carpal tunnel)
3. Test grip strength
4. Check for thenar atrophy
5. Test sensation in affected fingers
6. Review EMG results

**What to tell them:**
- Which hand is dominant
- Symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness)
- What activities cause symptoms
- Impact on work and daily activities

## Secondary Conditions

**CTS can be secondary to:**
- Diabetes (service-connected)
- Wrist fractures
- Thyroid conditions

**CTS can cause:**
- Depression (from chronic pain/limitation)
- Tendinitis in opposite hand (compensation)

## Personal Statement Template

---

**Personal Statement for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

I, [Full Name], submit this statement for carpal tunnel syndrome in my [left/right/both] hand(s). My [dominant/right/left] hand is my dominant hand.

**Military Duties Causing CTS:**

- [Mechanical work—describe]
- [Weapons maintenance—describe]
- [Other repetitive activities]

**Symptom Onset:**
I first noticed symptoms [during service/timeframe].

**Current Symptoms:**
- Numbness/tingling: [which fingers, frequency]
- Pain: [location, severity]
- Weakness: [describe grip problems]
- Night symptoms: [describe]

**Functional Impact:**
- Gripping: [difficulty]
- Fine motor tasks: [buttons, writing, typing]
- Work: [limitations]
- Dropping items: [frequency]

**Treatment:**
- Wrist splints: [use pattern]
- Injections: [number, effectiveness]
- Surgery: [if applicable]

I certify these statements are true.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does it matter which hand is affected?
Yes. Your dominant hand receives higher ratings than your non-dominant hand for moderate, severe, and complete paralysis levels.

### Do I need an EMG?
While not absolutely required, an EMG/nerve conduction study provides objective evidence that significantly strengthens your claim and helps establish severity.

### Can I claim both hands?
Yes. Each hand is rated separately. Bilateral CTS with both hands affected can significantly increase your combined rating.

### What if I had carpal tunnel surgery?
Surgery doesn't prevent a rating. You're rated on residual symptoms after surgery. Scarring from surgery may also be rated separately if painful.
