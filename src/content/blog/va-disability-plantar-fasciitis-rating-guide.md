# VA Disability Rating for Plantar Fasciitis: Complete Claims Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

Plantar fasciitis is rated under **Diagnostic Code 5276** (flatfoot) or **DC 5284** (other foot injuries) with ratings from **0% to 50%**. Most veterans receive **10-30%** depending on severity. This condition is extremely common among veterans due to running, rucking, and standing on hard surfaces during service. Each foot is rated separately, and bilateral (both feet) plantar fasciitis can significantly increase your combined rating. The key is documenting **pain, limitation, and failed treatments**. Claims typically take 3-6 months.

## What Is Plantar Fasciitis and How Does Military Service Cause It?

Plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the plantar fascia—the thick band of tissue connecting your heel bone to your toes. It causes stabbing heel pain, especially with first steps in the morning or after prolonged rest.

**Symptoms:**
- Sharp, stabbing heel pain (especially first steps)
- Pain worse in morning or after sitting
- Pain increases with activity
- Tenderness on bottom of foot/heel
- Difficulty standing or walking for extended periods

**Military causes:**

- **Running**: Thousands of miles on hard surfaces
- **Rucking**: Heavy loads putting stress on feet
- **Standing**: Long hours in formation, guard duty
- **Footwear**: Military boots often provide poor arch support
- **Impact training**: Jumping, obstacle courses
- **Weight carried**: Full combat load stresses feet
- **Concrete/hard surfaces**: Bases, ships, flight lines

## VA Rating Criteria

Plantar fasciitis can be rated under two diagnostic codes:

### DC 5276 - Flatfoot (Acquired)

Often used for plantar fasciitis if arch is affected:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | Mild; symptoms relieved by built-up shoe or arch support |
| **10%** | Moderate; weight-bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of tendo achillis, pain on manipulation and use of feet, bilateral or unilateral |
| **20%** | Severe; objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities, unilateral |
| **30%** | Severe; objective evidence of marked deformity, pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities, bilateral |
| **30%** | Pronounced; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of tendo achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances, unilateral |
| **50%** | Pronounced; bilateral |

### DC 5284 - Other Foot Injuries

If plantar fasciitis doesn't fit flatfoot criteria:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **10%** | Moderate |
| **20%** | Moderately severe |
| **30%** | Severe |
| **40%** | Actual loss of use of foot |

### Key Rating Points

- **Each foot rated separately** under DC 5276 for unilateral ratings
- **Bilateral ratings available** under DC 5276
- **Failed conservative treatment supports higher ratings**
- **Use of orthotics shows treatment need**

## Evidence You Need

### Service Connection Evidence
- Service treatment records showing foot complaints
- Sick call visits for heel/foot pain
- Physical profiles limiting running/marching
- MOS requiring extensive standing/running

### Current Diagnosis Evidence
- Diagnosis from podiatrist or orthopedist
- Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, or MRI) showing plantar fascia changes
- Physical examination findings

### Severity Evidence
- Treatment records showing failed conservative treatments
- Prescription orthotics records
- Documentation of steroid injections
- Surgical records (if applicable)
- Impact on walking/standing

## C&P Exam: What to Expect

**The examiner will:**
1. Review your medical history
2. Examine both feet
3. Assess pain on palpation
4. Check for arch abnormalities
5. Evaluate gait
6. Review imaging

**What to tell them:**
- Describe morning pain and first-step pain
- Explain how far you can walk before pain worsens
- List all treatments tried and their effectiveness
- Describe impact on work and daily activities

**Don't minimize pain:** Tell them about your worst days, not your best.

## Secondary Conditions

**Plantar fasciitis can cause:**
1. **Knee conditions** - Altered gait stresses knees
2. **Hip conditions** - Gait changes affect hips
3. **Back pain** - Compensatory changes
4. **Achilles tendinitis** - Related structure
5. **Heel spurs** - Often develops with plantar fasciitis

**Plantar fasciitis can be secondary to:**
- Obesity from service-connected conditions
- Knee/hip conditions causing altered gait
- Back conditions affecting posture

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I claim both feet separately?
Under DC 5284 (other foot injuries), each foot is rated separately. Under DC 5276 (flatfoot), there are specific bilateral ratings at 30% and 50%.

### What if I've tried everything and nothing helps?
This supports higher ratings. Document all failed treatments—the fact that orthotics and injections don't help shows severity.

### Do I need imaging?
While not required, X-rays or MRIs showing heel spurs, thickened fascia, or other changes strengthen your claim.

### Can plantar fasciitis be secondary to other conditions?
Yes. If knee, hip, or back problems cause altered gait leading to plantar fasciitis, it can be claimed as secondary.
