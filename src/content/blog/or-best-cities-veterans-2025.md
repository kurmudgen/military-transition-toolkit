# Best Cities in Oregon for Veterans 2025

## Bottom Line Up Front

Portland ranks #1 for Oregon veterans—it offers the best job opportunities (Intel, Nike, Providence Health), direct access to Portland VA Medical Center, strong veteran community (20,000+ veterans), and excellent quality of life despite expensive housing ($537,200 median). Eugene takes #2, combining University of Oregon GI Bill opportunities, Roseburg VA access (40 min), outdoor recreation paradise, and more affordable housing ($485,000 median) with progressive college-town culture.

For affordability, Medford and Klamath Falls offer median home prices under $400,000, though they're smaller with limited tech/corporate jobs. Salem balances cost ($423,498 median), state government jobs with veteran hiring preference, and 45-minute access to Portland VA.

Oregon's challenge is expensive housing across the board—statewide median is $475,000, well above national average ($404,400). However, no sales tax saves $1,500-$2,500 annually, and 40%+ disabled veterans get property tax exemptions worth $300-$500+ annually. Portland's high median ($537,200) is offset by higher wages and job diversity.

Overall, Oregon cities excel for outdoor recreation, progressive culture, and quality of life, but you'll pay premium costs in desirable areas. Best for veterans prioritizing nature access, liberal values, craft beer culture, and environmental consciousness over maximum financial savings.
