## Success Stories

**Jessica, Navy Spouse - Military Spouse Career Coach**
"I was the spouse everyone asked for job search advice. After three PCS cycles of rebuilding my own career, I knew the struggles intimately. I got my ICF certification, niched down to military spouse career coaching, and now I coach spouses worldwide on finding portable careers. I charge $250/session and have a waitlist. When we PCS'd to Japan, zero clients even noticed—we just adjusted session times by a few hours."

**David, Army Spouse - Executive Transition Coach**
"My background was corporate leadership. When my wife joined the Army, my career cratered. Coaching was my way back. I now coach service members and spouses transitioning out of military life. The corporate world pays premium rates—$400/session. I work 15-20 hours a week making more than I did in corporate."

**Aisha, Marine Corps Spouse - Wellness Coach**
"I got my health coaching certification through MyCAA. Started coaching military spouses on stress management and self-care during deployments. My clients are all military—they find me through spouse groups and word of mouth. I do group coaching programs for $500/person, six-week program. Twenty people per cohort = $10,000 per program. I run four per year."

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "I don't have credentials"
**Solution:** Coaching doesn't require licensure. Start with an affordable certification to build confidence and skills. Experience and results matter more than credentials over time.

### "Who would pay me for advice?"
**Reality:** People pay for accountability, support, and structured help—not just advice. Coaching is about asking questions and guiding clients, not lecturing. Your life experience makes you relatable.

### "The market is too saturated"
**Solution:** General life coaching is crowded. Niches are not. Military spouse coaching, career transition coaching, deployment resilience coaching—these have less competition and better targeting.

### "I don't know how to find clients"
**Solution:** Start with your network. Offer discovery calls. Create content that demonstrates your expertise. Most coaches build clientele through relationships, not ads.

### "What if a client needs therapy, not coaching?"
**Solution:** Know the difference and refer out when needed. Coaching is about goals and forward movement; therapy addresses clinical mental health issues. Build relationships with therapists for referrals.
