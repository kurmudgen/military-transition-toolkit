**Marine Logistics NCO to Operations Manager**
"I started as a part-time package handler while using my GI Bill. UPS promoted me to supervisor within a year when they saw my leadership skills. Now I manage an entire hub operation with 200+ employees. The military logistics experience was directly applicable."

**Navy Machinist's Mate to Fleet Mechanic**
"My Navy engine experience translated perfectly to UPS fleet maintenance. I work on their package cars and tractor-trailers. The diagnostic skills are identical. Great pay, union benefits, and I'm home every night."
