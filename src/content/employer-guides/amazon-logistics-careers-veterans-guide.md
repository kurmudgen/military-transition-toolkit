## Success Stories

**Army Logistics Officer to Senior Operations Manager**

**Marine Corps NCO to Area Manager**
"I thought my infantry experience wouldn't apply. Wrong. Amazon cares about leadership, decision-making, and results—not your MOS. I manage a team of 150 associates and use my fire team leadership daily. The mission-focus is familiar."

**Navy Logistics Specialist to Delivery Station Manager**
"My supply chain experience was perfect for Amazon's last-mile operations. I manage a delivery station ensuring thousands of packages reach customers daily. The urgency and logistics complexity mirror naval operations."
