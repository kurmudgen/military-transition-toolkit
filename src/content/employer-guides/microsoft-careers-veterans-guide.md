## Success Stories

**Army Signal Officer to Cloud Solution Architect**

**Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant to Customer Success Manager**
"I didn't think a non-technical Marine could work at Microsoft. But they valued my 20 years of leadership and customer-facing experience. MSSA helped me get the technical foundation, and now I manage relationships with Microsoft's largest commercial accounts."

**Navy IT to Security Engineer**
"My Navy cybersecurity experience translated directly. Microsoft's military recruiting team found me on LinkedIn and guided me through the process. The interview focused on how I think about security problems, not just certifications. I was hired at a senior level."
