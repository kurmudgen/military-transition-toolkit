**Air Force C-17 Pilot to FedEx Captain**
"FedEx actively recruits military pilots. My C-17 experience gave me the heavy aircraft time they wanted. Within 5 years, I upgraded to Captain on the MD-11. The flying is challenging (night cargo ops), but the pay and schedule beat the military. I'm home most nights."

**Army Transportation NCO to Operations Manager**
"I started at FedEx Express as a courier while finishing my degree. My military logistics experience caught management's attention. I was promoted to operations manager within 3 years, now overseeing 150 couriers. The mission-focused environment feels like the Army."

**Navy Aviation Mechanic to FedEx Aircraft Technician**
"My experience on naval aircraft—especially troubleshooting under pressure—translated directly to FedEx. They valued my military training and A&P license. I work on the 777s now, maintaining the aircraft that move packages worldwide."
