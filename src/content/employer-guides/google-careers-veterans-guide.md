# Google Careers for Veterans: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

- **Company Size**: 180,000+ employees globally (Alphabet)
- **Veteran Hiring Program**: Google for Veterans, VetNet Employee Resource Group

Google may seem intimidating, but they actively seek military talent. Their structured hiring process, while rigorous, actually benefits veterans who can demonstrate leadership, problem-solving, and adaptability through concrete examples.

## Company Overview

Google (part of Alphabet Inc.) is the world's leading technology company, dominating search, advertising, cloud computing, and mobile operating systems. Beyond search, Google operates YouTube, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Android, and invests in emerging technologies like AI and autonomous vehicles.

### By the Numbers
- **Employees**: 180,000+ globally
- **Annual Revenue**: $300+ billion
- **Market Cap**: $1.7+ trillion
- **Locations**: Headquarters in Mountain View, CA (Googleplex) with offices in 50+ countries
- **Data Centers**: 35+ data center locations worldwide

### Culture for Veterans

Google's culture emphasizes psychological safety, data-driven decisions, and "failing fast." While less hierarchical than the military, veterans often excel at Google because military service develops exactly what Google calls "emergent leadership"—the ability to step up when needed regardless of title. Google values diverse perspectives, and military experience provides a viewpoint many tech workers lack.

## Success Stories

**Army Captain (Logistics) to Program Manager**
