## Success Stories

**Navy Nuke to Electric Boat Engineer**
"My nuclear submarine experience was directly applicable at Electric Boat. I work on the same reactor systems I operated in the Navy, but now I help design the next generation. Understanding how sailors actually use these systems makes me a better engineer."

**Army Armor NCO to Land Systems Technician**
"I maintained M1 Abrams tanks for 12 years. Now I work at the Lima plant where they're made. My operational experience helps me understand what tankers need in the field. I've been promoted to supervisor and help train the next generation of tank builders."

**Air Force Cyber to GDIT Security Engineer**
"GDIT recruited me before I even separated. My TS/SCI and cyber experience were exactly what they needed for a government contract. The mission feels similar to active duty—protecting DoD networks from adversaries. The pay is significantly better."
