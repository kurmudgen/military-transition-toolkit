# How to Use LinkedIn Premium for Veterans (Free Year)

## Bottom Line Up Front

LinkedIn offers transitioning service members and veterans one full year of Premium Career for free—a $360 value. Most veterans either don't claim it or don't use it effectively. This guide shows you exactly how to claim your free year, explains every Premium feature, and provides strategies to maximize value during your transition. Don't leave this benefit on the table.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

LinkedIn Premium gives you:
- Direct messaging to anyone (InMail)
- See who viewed your profile
- Applicant insights showing how you compare
- Salary data for negotiation
- LinkedIn Learning access (16,000+ courses)
- Featured applicant status

These tools accelerate job search significantly. The question isn't whether Premium is valuable—it's whether you'll use it strategically.

## How to Claim Your Free Year

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Go to linkedin.com/veterans**
2. **Click "Get your free year of Premium"**
3. **Sign in to your LinkedIn account** (or create one)
4. **Verify your military service:**
   - Enter service dates
   - Provide DD-214 or service verification
   - Some users verified via ID.me
5. **Activate Premium Career**

### Eligibility

- Active duty service members (6+ months remaining)
- Veterans (any era, any discharge status)
- National Guard and Reserve members
- Military spouses (through separate program)

### Timing Tips

- **Best time to claim:** 3-6 months before separation
- **Don't claim too early:** The year starts when you activate
- **Don't wait too long:** Use it while actively job searching

### If You Have Issues

- Try a different browser or clear cache
- Use ID.me for verification if direct verification fails
- Contact LinkedIn Support: linkedin.com/help
