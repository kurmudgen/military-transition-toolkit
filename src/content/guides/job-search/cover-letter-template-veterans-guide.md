# Cover Letter Template for Veterans (5 Industries)

## Bottom Line Up Front

A strong cover letter translates your military experience into value that civilian employers understand. Most veterans either skip cover letters or write generic ones that don't connect their service to the role. This guide provides ready-to-use templates for five industries, with a framework for customizing to any opportunity.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Cover letters are your opportunity to:
- Explain why you're transitioning
- Connect military experience to the specific role
- Demonstrate written communication skills
- Show you researched the company
- Address any concerns proactively

For veterans, cover letters are especially important because:
- They bridge the military-civilian gap
- They translate experience in context
- They show you understand the company's needs
- They differentiate you from other veterans

## The Universal Framework

### Structure

**Paragraph 1: The Hook (2-3 sentences)**
- Why you're writing
- What position you want
- Your most compelling qualification

**Paragraph 2: Your Value (4-6 sentences)**
- Translate military experience to the role
- Specific accomplishments that matter
- Why your background is relevant

**Paragraph 3: Why This Company (3-4 sentences)**
- Why you want THIS role at THIS company
- What you know about them
- How you align with their mission

**Paragraph 4: The Close (2-3 sentences)**
- Restate interest
- Call to action
- Thank them
