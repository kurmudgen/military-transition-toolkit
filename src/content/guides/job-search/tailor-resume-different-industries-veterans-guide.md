# How to Tailor Your Resume for Different Industries

## Bottom Line Up Front

Sending the same resume to every job is one of the biggest job search mistakes. Each industry values different experiences, uses different terminology, and has different expectations. This guide teaches you how to tailor your veteran resume for any industry—keeping your core experience while emphasizing what each employer wants to see.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Tailoring is critical because:
- Different industries use different keywords
- What impresses one sector may not matter to another
- ATS systems filter for industry-specific terms
- Hiring managers scan for relevant experience first

Veterans face extra challenges:
- Military experience translates differently by industry
- The same skill may be valued in one sector but not another
- Terminology varies dramatically between sectors

A tailored resume shows you understand the employer's world, not just your own.

## The Master Resume Method

### Step 1: Create Your Master Resume

Keep a comprehensive document (3-5 pages) with:
- ALL positions and accomplishments
- ALL certifications and training
- ALL skills and tools
- Multiple versions of bullets

This is your source document—never submit it directly.

### Step 2: Create Industry-Specific Versions

From your master, create tailored versions:
- Keep core structure consistent
- Change emphasis and keywords
- Adjust skills section
- Modify summary statement

### Step 3: Customize for Each Application

For specific jobs, further refine:
- Mirror language from job posting
- Highlight most relevant experience
- Adjust skills order
- Tweak summary to match
