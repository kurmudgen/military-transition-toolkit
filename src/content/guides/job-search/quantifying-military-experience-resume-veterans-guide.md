# Quantifying Military Experience on Your Resume

## Bottom Line Up Front

Numbers make your resume believable and memorable. "Managed logistics" is forgettable. "Managed logistics for 500 personnel across 3 countries, moving $45M in equipment with zero losses" is impressive. This guide teaches you how to find, calculate, and present the metrics that make civilian hiring managers take notice. Every military job has numbers—you just need to know where to look.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Quantified resumes get results:
- 40% more likely to get interviews
- Easier for hiring managers to assess impact
- Differentiates you from other candidates
- Proves you can measure and improve performance

Veterans often undersell because:
- Military downplays individual accomplishment
- You weren't taught to track metrics for job searches
- Numbers feel like "bragging"
- You don't know what civilians find impressive

The truth: Civilian hiring managers expect quantified accomplishments. Without numbers, your claims are just opinions.

## Calculating Metrics You Don't Have

### Estimating Team Size

**If you don't remember exactly:**
- Platoon: 30-50 personnel
- Company: 100-200 personnel
- Battalion: 500-800 personnel
- Brigade: 3,000-5,000 personnel

Use ranges or conservative estimates: "40+ personnel" or "approximately 150 personnel"

### Estimating Equipment Value

**Common equipment values:**
- HMMWV: $70,000-$220,000
- LMTV: $100,000-$150,000
- Bradley: $2.8-3.6 million
- Helicopter (UH-60): $21 million
- Fighter jet: $80-100+ million

Add up your property book or estimate based on equipment types.

### Calculating Percentages

**Improvement percentage:**
(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value × 100

Example: Reduced errors from 50 to 10 per month
(50 - 10) / 50 × 100 = 80% reduction

**Achievement percentage:**
Actual / Target × 100

Example: Required 90% readiness, achieved 98%
98 / 90 × 100 = 109% of standard

### Estimating Time Savings

**Calculate weekly/monthly/annual impact:**
- Hours saved per task × Tasks per week = Weekly savings
- Weekly savings × 52 = Annual savings

Example: Saved 30 minutes per report × 20 reports per week = 10 hours weekly
10 hours × 52 weeks = 520 hours per year

### Converting to Dollars

**Time to money:**
Hours saved × Hourly rate = Dollar savings

Example: 520 hours saved × $30/hour = $15,600 annually

**Efficiency to money:**
% improvement × Original cost = Savings

Example: 20% reduction in $100K process = $20K savings

## Formatting Numbers Effectively

### When to Use Digits vs. Words

**Use digits for:**
- All metrics and measurements
- Numbers that should stand out
- Statistics and percentages

**Examples:**
- "Led 45-person team" (not "forty-five person")
- "Saved $150K annually"
- "Achieved 98% accuracy"

### Formatting Large Numbers

**Use symbols for readability:**
- $1.5M instead of $1,500,000
- $150K instead of $150,000
- 3K instead of 3,000 (for casual contexts)

**Be consistent throughout resume**

### Ranges and Approximations

**When exact numbers unknown:**
- "40+ personnel" (minimum known)
- "Approximately $2M" (estimate)
- "$3-5M in equipment" (range)
- "150-200 customers daily" (range)

### Percentage vs. Multiplier

**Both work:**
- "Improved by 50%" = "Improved by 1.5x"
- "Tripled output" = "Increased by 200%"
- "Reduced by 75%" = "Cut to one-quarter"

Choose whichever sounds more impressive for your achievement.

**With context:** "Trained 200 soldiers annually, highest volume in brigade"

### Show Comparison

**Against standard:** "Exceeded 90% standard with 98% achievement"
**Against peers:** "Ranked #1 of 15 teams"
**Against history:** "Best performance in unit's 20-year history"

### Demonstrate Impact

**Connect to outcomes:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: No Numbers At All

**Before:** "Managed logistics operations."
**After:** "Managed $15M logistics operation supporting 3,000 personnel."

### Mistake 2: Vague Approximations

**Before:** "Supervised some soldiers."
**After:** "Supervised 25 soldiers across 3 shifts."

### Mistake 3: Irrelevant Numbers

**Skip:** "5 years in Army" (already in dates)
**Include:** "Led 5 complex operations simultaneously"

### Mistake 4: Unimpressive Numbers Made Prominent

**Reconsider:** "Managed 2-person team" (too small to highlight)
**Better:** "Independently managed operations in supervisor's absence"

### Mistake 5: Numbers Without Context

**Before:** "Achieved 87% on inspection."
**After:** "Achieved 87% on inspection, highest score in division history."

### Mistake 6: Inconsistent Formatting

**Wrong:** "Managed $1.5 million budget and 50 personnel"
**Right:** "Managed $1.5M budget and 50 personnel"
