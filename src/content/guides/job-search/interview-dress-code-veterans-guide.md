# What to Wear to Interviews as a Veteran (By Industry)

## Bottom Line Up Front

What you wear to an interview affects how you're perceived before you say a word. Veterans are used to dress codes—but civilian dress codes vary dramatically by industry, company, and region. Wearing a suit to a startup interview can be as damaging as wearing jeans to a bank interview. This guide provides specific dress code guidance by industry, explains the unwritten rules of professional appearance, and helps you make the right first impression in any setting.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Dress codes are more complex in the civilian world:
- No uniform regulations to follow
- Varies by industry, company, and region
- "Business casual" means different things everywhere
- Overdressing can be as problematic as underdressing

Veterans often:
- Default to overdressing (feels safe)
- Don't know industry norms
- Haven't updated civilian wardrobe in years
- Underestimate importance of fit and style

Getting this right shows you understand the culture you're entering.

## Virtual Interview Dress Code

For video interviews, adjust your approach:

### What to Wear

**Top half matters most:**
- Solid colors work better on camera
- Avoid busy patterns (they can look strange on video)
- Blue looks good on most skin tones on camera
- Avoid white (can wash you out) and black (can look flat)

**Still dress the full part:**
- Wear pants (you might need to stand up)
- Keeps you in professional mindset

### Background and Lighting

**Background:**
- Clean, uncluttered space
- Neutral background preferred
- Remove distractions
- Bookshelves are fine; messy rooms are not

**Lighting:**
- Natural light in front of you (not behind)
- Avoid shadows on your face
- Test your setup before the interview

## The Details That Matter

### Fit Is Everything

Clothes that don't fit well look unprofessional regardless of quality:
- Shirts should fit at the shoulders
- Pants shouldn't bunch at the ankles
- Jackets should button without pulling
- Nothing too tight or too loose

**Veteran tip:** Military uniforms are fitted specifically. Get civilian clothes tailored or buy from stores with good fit for your body type.

### Grooming

**Hair:**
- Clean and neat
- Doesn't have to be military short, but well-kept
- Facial hair is acceptable if groomed

**Nails:**
- Clean and trimmed
- Natural polish acceptable for women

**Scent:**
- Minimal or no cologne/perfume
- Deodorant is essential
- Fresh breath (avoid garlic/onions before interviews)

### Accessories

**Watch:** Simple and professional (no smart watches showing notifications)

**Jewelry:** Minimal and tasteful

**Bag:** Professional bag or briefcase (not military-style backpack)

**Shoes:** Clean and polished (this gets noticed)

### Things That Get Noticed

**Positive signals:**
- Well-fitted clothes
- Polished shoes
- Clean, pressed appearance
- Appropriate for the industry

**Negative signals:**
- Wrinkled clothes
- Scuffed shoes
- Visible stains
- Strong cologne/perfume
- Overly casual for the industry
- Overdressed for the culture

## How to Research Dress Code

### Before the Interview

1. **Check the company website** - Photos often show employees
2. **Look at LinkedIn** - See what employees wear in photos
3. **Ask the recruiter** - "What's the typical dress code for interviews?"
4. **Ask veteran employees** - If you know veterans at the company, ask them
5. **Visit the office** - If possible, walk by and observe

### The Safe Question to Ask

When scheduling the interview, it's perfectly acceptable to ask:

"What's the typical dress code for interviews at [Company]?"

This shows you're thinking about culture fit, not that you're clueless.

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Defaulting to suits everywhere** - Tech and startups don't want formal.

2. **Ignoring fit** - Baggy or tight clothes look unprofessional.

3. **Military accessories** - Save the challenge coins for networking, not interviews.

4. **Not researching** - Every company is different; do your homework.

5. **Wearing a uniform or uniform-adjacent clothing** - Civilian interviews call for civilian clothes.

6. **Forgetting shoes** - Scuffed or inappropriate shoes get noticed.

7. **Overdoing fragrance** - Less is more; some offices are scent-free.

8. **Not having a backup** - Bring extra clothes if traveling; things happen.
