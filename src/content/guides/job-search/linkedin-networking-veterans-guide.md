# How to Network on LinkedIn as a Veteran

## Bottom Line Up Front

LinkedIn networking isn't about collecting connections—it's about building relationships that open doors. Veterans often have smaller civilian networks and feel uncomfortable "networking." This guide gives you the exact strategies, message templates, and daily actions to build a network that generates opportunities. You'll learn who to connect with, what to say, and how to maintain relationships that lead to jobs.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The numbers are clear:
- 85% of jobs are filled through networking
- Candidates with referrals are 4x more likely to get hired
- Veterans transitioning often have networks limited to military contacts

Military culture teaches us to earn everything. But in the civilian world, asking for help isn't weakness—it's how things work. Your network is your net worth, especially during transition.

### The Veteran Networking Challenge

Most veterans struggle with networking because:
- Military networks don't translate to civilian job markets
- Reaching out feels like "begging" or "using people"
- We're uncomfortable talking about ourselves
- We don't know what to say or who to contact

This guide solves all of these problems.

## Who to Connect With

### Priority 1: Fellow Veterans (Easiest)

Veterans hire veterans. Start here because:
- Shared experience creates instant rapport
- They understand your background without translation
- Many actively help transitioning service members

**How to find them:**
- Search "Army veteran [target industry]"
- Search "Marine veteran [target company]"
- Look for "Hire Heroes USA," "American Corporate Partners," "Shift.org" in profiles
- Join veteran LinkedIn groups and connect with active members

### Priority 2: People at Target Companies

Build connections before you apply:
- Recruiters and talent acquisition
- Hiring managers in your target function
- Veterans already working there
- People with similar career paths

**How to find them:**
- Search LinkedIn for "[company name] + [job function]"
- Use "People" filter to see company employees
- Look at "People Also Viewed" on relevant profiles
- Check company's LinkedIn page for employee list

### Priority 3: Industry Professionals

Expand beyond specific companies:
- Industry thought leaders
- People posting content in your target field
- Conference speakers and authors
- Consultants and advisors

### Priority 4: Alumni and Affinity Groups

Leverage existing connections:
- College/university alumni
- Military school classmates (OCS, NCO Academy, etc.)
- People from your hometown
- Members of professional associations

## Connection Request Strategy

### The Golden Rule

Never send a blank connection request. Always personalize.

### Connection Request Template: Fellow Veteran

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're an [Branch] veteran now working in [industry/company]. I'm currently transitioning from [X] years in the [Branch] and researching opportunities in [field].

I'd love to connect and learn from your experience making the transition.

[Your name]
```

### Connection Request Template: Target Company Employee

```
Hi [Name],

I'm a military veteran researching [Company] for my career transition. Your background in [their role/department] caught my attention.

I'd love to connect and learn more about [Company]'s culture and opportunities.

[Your name]
```

### Connection Request Template: Industry Professional

```
Hi [Name],

Your posts about [topic] have been valuable as I transition from [X] years in the military to [industry]. I'm building my network in [field] and would be honored to connect.

[Your name]
```

### Connection Request Template: Alumni

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed we both attended [school/program]. I'm a military veteran transitioning to [industry] and building my professional network.

I'd appreciate the chance to connect with a fellow [school] alum.

[Your name]
```

## Message Strategy After Connecting

### The 48-Hour Follow-Up

When someone accepts your connection, follow up within 48 hours:

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! As mentioned, I'm transitioning from the [Branch] after [X] years. I'm particularly interested in [specific thing about their work/company].

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share your perspective on [specific topic]? I'd be grateful for any insights.

[Your name]
```

### Key Principles

1. **Be specific** - "Can you help me?" is bad. "Can you tell me about the hiring process at [Company]?" is good.

2. **Be brief** - Respect their time. No one wants to read a paragraph.

3. **Ask for little** - 15 minutes, one question, a specific piece of advice.

4. **Give before asking** - Comment on their posts, share their content, offer help first.

## The Informational Interview Ask

Once you've built rapport, ask for informational interviews:

### Template: Informational Interview Request

```
Hi [Name],

I've really appreciated connecting and learning from your insights on [topic]. As I continue my transition from [Branch] to [industry], I'd love to hear more about your career journey.

Would you have 20-30 minutes in the next few weeks for a phone or video call? I'm researching [specific area] and your experience at [Company/in industry] would be incredibly valuable.

I'm flexible on timing—happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks for considering,
[Your name]
```

### What to Ask in Informational Interviews

**About Their Path:**
- How did you make the transition to this industry?
- What surprised you most about civilian work culture?
- What do you wish you'd known when you were transitioning?

**About the Industry:**
- What skills are most valued in this field?
- What certifications or credentials should I pursue?
- What trends are shaping this industry?

**About Their Company:**
- What's the culture like at [Company]?
- How does [Company] view military experience?
- What does success look like in your role?

**For Direction:**
- Based on my background, what roles should I target?
- Who else would you recommend I talk to?
- What should I research next?

## Daily Networking Actions

### Commenting That Gets Noticed

Bad comment: "Great post!"

### What to Post

- Insights from informational interviews (with permission)

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because I saw a [Job Title] position at [Company] that looks like a great fit for my background.

Given your experience at [Company], I was hoping you might be willing to refer me or introduce me to the hiring team. I've attached my resume for reference.

I understand if this isn't something you're comfortable doing—I value our connection regardless.

Thanks for considering,
[Your name]
```

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Waiting until you need something** - Build relationships before job searching.

2. **Sending generic connection requests** - Personalization matters. A lot.

3. **Asking for too much too soon** - "Can you get me a job?" on first contact doesn't work.

4. **Not following up** - One conversation isn't a relationship.

5. **Only connecting with recruiters** - Employees can refer you; recruiters can't.

6. **Being too formal** - LinkedIn is professional but conversational.

7. **Ignoring alumni connections** - Shared background creates instant rapport.

## Real Examples

### Connection to Interview Pipeline

**Week 1:** Connect with veteran at target company
**Week 2:** Thank them for connecting, ask about their experience
**Week 3:** Have 20-minute informational call
**Week 4:** Follow up with thank you, ask who else to talk to
**Week 5:** Connect with their referral, repeat process
**Week 6:** Learn about opening, ask original contact for referral
**Result:** Referred application, interview scheduled

### Building Industry Network

**Month 1:** Connect with 50 veterans in target industry, join 3 groups
**Month 2:** Have 8 informational interviews, start commenting on industry content
**Month 3:** Post about transition journey, receive 2 inbound messages about opportunities
**Result:** Multiple warm leads, industry knowledge, insider referrals
