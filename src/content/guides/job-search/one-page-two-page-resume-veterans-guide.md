# One-Page vs Two-Page Resume: What Works for Veterans

## Bottom Line Up Front

The "one-page resume" rule is a myth that hurts experienced veterans. Your resume length should match your experience level and target role. Most veterans with 8+ years of military service need two pages to properly showcase their qualifications. This guide helps you decide the right length and shows you how to format both one-page and two-page resumes effectively.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Veterans often face this dilemma:
- Career counselors say "one page only"
- Military experience is substantial and varied
- Cutting content feels like underselling yourself
- But a 5-page federal resume won't work either

The truth: **Content relevance trumps arbitrary length rules.**

Hiring managers prefer a clear, comprehensive two-page resume over a cramped one-page resume that omits important qualifications.

## When to Use One Page

### One Page Works For:

**Experience level:**
- Less than 8 years total experience
- E-1 to E-5 enlisted
- O-1 to O-2 officers
- One or two distinct military roles

**Target roles:**
- Entry-level positions
- Individual contributor roles
- Positions where military experience is less central

**Situations:**
- Career fairs (need quick scanning)
- Entry-level applications
- Industries where brevity is valued (some tech startups)
- When you have limited relevant experience

### One Page Example Scenario

**Profile:** E-5 with 6 years of service, one primary MOS, targeting entry-level operations role.

**Why one page works:**
- Limited career progression to detail
- Few distinct roles/assignments
- Entry-level target doesn't require extensive history
- Can include all relevant experience concisely

## When to Use Two Pages

### Two Pages Works For:

**Experience level:**
- 8+ years total experience
- E-6 and above enlisted
- O-3 and above officers
- Multiple significant roles/assignments
- Career progression to demonstrate

**Target roles:**
- Management and leadership positions
- Senior individual contributor roles
- Positions requiring substantial experience
- Defense contractor roles

**Situations:**
- Most veteran job searches
- When multiple assignments are relevant
- When extensive training/certifications matter
- For comprehensive skill demonstration

### Two Page Example Scenario

**Profile:** E-7 with 15 years of service, multiple assignments, leadership progression, targeting operations manager role.

**Why two pages works:**
- Significant career progression to show
- Multiple relevant leadership positions
- Certifications and training that matter
- Cannot adequately present experience on one page

## The Decision Framework

### Ask These Questions

**1. How much relevant experience do you have?**
- Less than 8 years → Consider one page
- 8+ years → Likely need two pages

**2. How senior is your target role?**
- Entry-level → One page acceptable
- Mid-level and above → Two pages expected

**3. Can you fit all important content on one page?**
- Yes, without cramming → One page
- No, content is compressed → Two pages

**4. What does your industry expect?**
- Most industries → Two pages fine for experienced professionals
- Some startups → Preference for brevity
- Federal → Longer resumes expected

### The "Cut Test"

Write everything relevant, then try to cut to one page:
- If nothing can be cut without losing value → Two pages
- If significant content is fluff → One page

## Formatting One-Page Resumes

### Maximize Space

**Header:**
```

City, ST | (555) 123-4567 | email@email.com | linkedin.com/in/johndoe
```
- One-line header saves space
- Only essential contact info

**Summary:**
- 2-3 lines maximum
- Or skip entirely for more space

**Margins:**
- 0.5 inch acceptable (0.75-1.0 standard)
- Don't go below 0.5 inch

**Font:**
- 10-11 pt for body text
- Don't go below 10 pt

**Spacing:**
- Single space within sections
- Small space between sections

### Content Prioritization

**Include:**
- Most relevant experience (last 2-3 roles)
- Key achievements with metrics
- Essential skills
- Relevant certifications
- Education

**Consider cutting:**
- Older or less relevant positions
- Detailed duty descriptions
- All but top achievements
- Non-essential certifications

## Common Questions

### "Career counselors say one page only"

Many career counselors learn outdated rules. The "one-page rule" came from an era before ATS systems, when resumes were physically handled. Modern hiring managers prefer comprehensive information over arbitrary brevity. Research shows recruiters spend MORE time on two-page resumes when they contain relevant content.

### "Hiring managers only spend 7 seconds on resumes"

This statistic refers to initial scanning, not total review. If your first page passes the 7-second scan, they read the full document. Your job is to make page 1 compelling enough for continued reading.

### "Will recruiters read the second page?"

Yes—if page 1 captures their interest. Studies show hiring managers review complete resumes when candidates seem qualified. The risk isn't that they won't read page 2; it's that a cramped one-page resume won't capture interest at all.

### "What about career fairs?"

For career fairs, a one-page resume is practical for quick exchanges. Consider maintaining both versions: a two-page "full" resume for applications and a one-page "highlight" resume for events.

## Mistakes to Avoid

### One-Page Mistakes

**Cramming:**
- 9pt font is too small
- 0.25 margins are too narrow
- Eliminate bullets, not formatting

**Omitting important content:**
- Cutting quantified achievements
- Removing relevant experience
- Skipping certifications that matter

### Two-Page Mistakes

**Padding:**
- Adding irrelevant content to fill space
- Including outdated experience
- Listing every task ever performed

**Poor page breaks:**
- Breaking mid-position
- Having 3 lines on page 2
- Orphaning section headers

**Forgetting page 2 header:**
- Always include name and "Page 2"
- Ensures pages stay together if separated

## The Hybrid Approach

### Master Resume + Tailored Versions

**Keep:**
- Master resume with all content (may be 3+ pages)
- Update whenever you have new accomplishments

**Create as needed:**
- Two-page version for most applications
- One-page version for career fairs
- Tailored versions for specific opportunities

### What to Cut When Shortening

**Priority 1 (keep):**
- Most relevant experience
- Top achievements with metrics
- Required skills and certifications

**Priority 2 (keep if space):**
- Supporting achievements
- Professional development
- Additional certifications

**Priority 3 (cut first):**
- Older, less relevant experience
- Generic job duties
- Non-essential information

## Action Checklist

- [ ] Assess your experience level (years, roles)
- [ ] Identify target role seniority
- [ ] Write out all relevant content without length constraint
- [ ] Try fitting on one page—what's lost?
- [ ] Try two pages—is there meaningful content?
- [ ] Choose format based on content needs
- [ ] Format appropriately for chosen length
- [ ] Create alternative version for different uses
- [ ] Have someone review for right balance
- [ ] Keep master document updated

*Resume length should serve your content, not arbitrary rules. If you need two pages to present your qualifications effectively, use two pages. If one page tells your story completely, that's enough. Choose the length that gets you interviews.*
