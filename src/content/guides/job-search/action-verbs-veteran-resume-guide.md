# Action Verbs for Veteran Resumes (200+ Examples)

## Bottom Line Up Front

Every resume bullet should start with a powerful action verb. Using "Responsible for" or "Duties included" weakens your resume instantly. This guide provides 200+ action verbs organized by skill category, with examples showing how veterans should use them. Replace weak language with strong verbs and watch your resume transform.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Action verbs matter because:
- They show you taking initiative, not just filling a role
- Strong verbs grab attention in 7-second resume scans
- They help ATS systems identify your skills
- Different verbs demonstrate different competencies

Veterans often default to passive language:
- "Was responsible for..." (passive)
- "Duties included..." (list, not achievement)
- "Assisted with..." (minimizes contribution)

Replace these with action verbs that show you delivered results.
