# How to Use USAJOBS Effectively: Complete Guide

## Bottom Line Up Front

USAJOBS is the gateway to federal employment, and veterans have significant advantages through veterans' preference. But the system is complex—wrong formatting or incomplete applications get rejected before human review. This guide walks you through creating a winning USAJOBS profile, understanding veterans' preference, and navigating the federal hiring process.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Federal employment benefits for veterans:
- **Veterans' preference:** 5-10 points added to your score
- **Special hiring authorities:** VRA, 30% disabled, Schedule A
- **Preference in reductions:** Protected during layoffs
- **Military service credit:** Counts toward retirement

Federal employment benefits:
- Job security and stability
- Strong benefits package
- Pension and retirement
- Work-life balance
- Clear advancement paths

The challenge: USAJOBS has a specific process that frustrates many applicants. Understanding it gives you a major advantage.

## Understanding Veterans' Preference

### Types of Preference

**5-Point Preference (TP):**
- Served during wartime or campaign
- No disability required
- Honorable discharge required

**10-Point Preference (multiple categories):**

**CP (Compensable Disability):**
- 10-30% service-connected disability

**CPS (Compensable Disability - Severe):**
- 30%+ service-connected disability

**XP (Other 10-Point):**
- Purple Heart recipients
- Certain specific conditions

### Eligibility Requirements

### How Preference Works

**Category Rating System (most common):**
1. Applicants sorted into "Best Qualified," "Well Qualified," "Qualified"
2. Veterans with preference float to top of their category
3. 10-point veterans considered before 5-point

**Numerical Rating System:**
1. Points added to your score
2. 5-point preference adds 5 points
3. 10-point preference adds 10 points
4. Maximum score remains 100 (points can exceed threshold)
