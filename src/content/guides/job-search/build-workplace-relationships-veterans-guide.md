# How to Build Relationships at Work Without Military Camaraderie

## Bottom Line Up Front

Military service creates instant, deep bonds—shared hardship, common purpose, and a unique culture forge relationships quickly. Civilian workplaces don't work that way. Relationships take longer to develop, form around different dynamics, and require different approaches. Many veterans struggle with this, feeling isolated or frustrated that connections don't happen naturally. This guide shows you how to build meaningful workplace relationships in civilian environments where camaraderie isn't automatic.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Relationships affect everything:
- Career advancement often depends on who knows and vouches for you
- Collaboration requires trust and connection
- Job satisfaction is heavily influenced by relationships
- Information and opportunities flow through networks

Veterans miss:
- Automatic belonging to a unit
- Shared identity with colleagues
- Deep bonds formed quickly
- The sense of "we're in this together"

The adjustment is real:
- Civilian relationships form differently
- It takes longer than you're used to
- The absence of camaraderie can feel lonely
- Your skills in relationship-building need updating

## Understanding the Difference

### Military Relationship Formation

**How it happens:**
- Automatic shared identity (all wearing the same uniform)
- Common mission and purpose
- Shared hardships (training, deployments, long hours)
- Forced proximity (living and working together)
- Clear hierarchy creates known dynamics
- "In-group" status is instant

**Result:**
Deep bonds form quickly, often lasting a lifetime.

### Civilian Relationship Formation

**How it happens:**
- No automatic shared identity
- Individual goals may differ from team goals
- Hardships are less intense and not shared equally
- People go home at the end of the day
- Hierarchy is flatter and more ambiguous
- Trust builds gradually through interactions

**Result:**
Meaningful relationships take months or years to develop.

### The Emotional Gap

Many veterans experience:
- Loneliness when work friendships don't materialize quickly
- Frustration that colleagues seem superficial
- Confusion about how to connect without shared experience
- Grief for the loss of military camaraderie
- Feeling like an outsider looking in

This is normal. Acknowledging it is the first step to addressing it.

## Relationship-Building Strategies

### 1. Show Up Consistently

**In the military:** You were together constantly, so relationships happened.
**In civilian work:** You need to be intentional about presence.

**Actions:**
- Be physically present (or virtually present) in common spaces
- Attend optional meetings and events
- Participate in team activities
- Don't always eat lunch at your desk
- Join coffee breaks or informal gatherings

**Why it matters:**
Relationships require repeated interactions. Showing up creates opportunities for connection.

### 2. Find Common Ground

**In the military:** Shared identity was automatic.
**In civilian work:** You need to discover shared interests.

**Actions:**
- Ask about hobbies, interests, family
- Notice what colleagues care about outside work
- Find shared interests (sports, music, kids, travel)
- Discuss non-work topics when appropriate
- Remember details and follow up

**Conversation starters:**
- "What do you do outside of work?"
- "Any plans for the weekend?"
- "How was your [thing they mentioned]?"
- "I noticed you have a [sports team/interest] on your desk..."

### 3. Be Helpful Without Strings

**In the military:** Helping your buddy was natural and expected.
**In civilian work:** Helpfulness builds relationships, but differently.

**Actions:**
- Offer help when you see someone struggling
- Share information that might benefit others
- Volunteer for tasks that help the team
- Give credit to others publicly
- Be generous with your knowledge

**Why it matters:**
Helpfulness without expecting immediate return builds trust and goodwill over time.

### 4. Show Genuine Interest

**In the military:** You knew your people's stories because you lived together.
**In civilian work:** You have to actively learn about colleagues.

**Actions:**
- Ask questions and listen to answers
- Remember what people tell you
- Follow up on things they shared
- Show interest in their work, not just yours
- Acknowledge their accomplishments

**Sample questions:**
- "How did you get into this field?"
- "What's the most interesting project you've worked on?"
- "What do you enjoy most about working here?"
- "Tell me more about that..."

### 5. Be Appropriately Vulnerable

**In the military:** Vulnerability came from shared hardship.
**In civilian work:** Strategic vulnerability builds connection.

**Actions:**
- Admit when you don't know something
- Share (appropriate) personal information
- Acknowledge mistakes
- Ask for help when you need it
- Express genuine emotions (appropriately)

**Why it matters:**
Vulnerability invites connection. If you're always perfect and self-sufficient, you're hard to connect with.

**Note:** Don't overshare or trauma-dump. Appropriate vulnerability means being human, not unloading.

### 6. Navigate Social Events

**In the military:** Social events were often mandatory or unit-based.
**In civilian work:** Social events are optional but important.

**Actions:**
- Attend happy hours, team events, and celebrations
- Stay for a reasonable amount of time (not first to leave)
- Engage with different people, not just your immediate team
- Limit alcohol consumption at work events
- Follow up on conversations afterward

**Tips:**
- Prepare a few conversation topics in advance
- Have a polite exit strategy if needed
- Use these events to meet people outside your team
- Remember: these are networking opportunities

### 7. Leverage One-on-Ones

**In the military:** You talked to your people constantly.
**In civilian work:** One-on-ones may need to be scheduled.

**Actions:**
- Have regular one-on-ones with your manager
- Ask colleagues for coffee or lunch
- Use meetings for relationship building, not just tasks
- Request informational one-on-ones with people in other departments
- Make one-on-ones about them, not just about you

**How to ask:**
"Would you be up for grabbing coffee sometime? I'd love to learn more about [their work/experience]."

### 8. Build Your Network Deliberately

**In the military:** Your network was your unit.
**In civilian work:** You need to build your network intentionally.

**Actions:**
- Connect with colleagues on LinkedIn
- Seek mentors in the organization
- Join employee resource groups (especially veteran ERGs)
- Participate in cross-functional projects
- Maintain relationships with people who leave

**Why it matters:**
Your network is your career safety net. Invest in it before you need it.

## Relationship Levels

Not all workplace relationships need to be deep. Understand the different levels:

### Level 1: Professional Acquaintance
- You know each other's names and roles
- Polite, professional interactions
- Small talk in passing
- Most colleagues are at this level

### Level 2: Working Relationship
- Regular collaboration
- Trust in work context
- Understand each other's work styles
- Will help each other out

### Level 3: Work Friend
- Talk about non-work topics
- Enjoy each other's company
- Look out for each other
- May socialize outside work occasionally

### Level 4: True Friend
- Relationship transcends the job
- Would stay connected if one left
- Share personal matters
- Rare in any workplace

**Goal:** Have mostly Level 1-2, some Level 3, and if you're lucky, a Level 4 or two.

## Navigating Specific Challenges

### "I Don't Have Anything in Common with These People"

**Reality check:** You may have more in common than you think. The difference is the experiences aren't shared—you need to discover common ground.

**What to do:**
- Look for universal topics (family, hobbies, goals)
- Find professional common ground (challenges, aspirations)
- Recognize that different backgrounds can be interesting, not alienating
- Give people a chance before writing them off

### "Small Talk Feels Pointless"

**Reality check:** Small talk is the gateway to deeper conversation. It's how civilians build familiarity before trust.

**What to do:**
- Reframe small talk as reconnaissance—you're learning about people
- Keep a few reliable topics in mind (weather, weekend plans, local events)
- Use small talk as a transition to more meaningful conversation
- Remember: everyone finds it awkward; you're not alone

### "No One Understands My Background"

**Reality check:** True, but they don't need to understand your military experience to be good colleagues and friends.

**What to do:**
- Don't expect civilians to understand military culture
- Share stories in ways civilians can connect with
- Find other veterans in the organization
- Focus on forward, not backward—what you're building now

### "I'm Older Than My Peers Because of My Service"

**Reality check:** Age differences can feel awkward, but they matter less than you think.

**What to do:**
- Focus on shared interests, not age
- Respect colleagues regardless of age
- Don't emphasize the age gap
- Bring your experience as an asset, not a barrier

### "I Miss the Military Brotherhood/Sisterhood"

**Reality check:** That level of bond is rare outside the military. It's okay to grieve that loss.

**What to do:**
- Maintain relationships with military friends
- Join veteran organizations outside of work
- Accept that civilian friendships are different, not lesser
- Give yourself time to adjust expectations

## Building Relationships Remotely

If you work remotely or hybrid:

### Virtual Presence

- Turn camera on for meetings
- Speak up and participate
- Use chat features actively
- Be responsive to messages

### Intentional Connection

- Schedule virtual coffee chats
- Reach out to new team members
- Participate in virtual social events
- Share personal updates in appropriate channels

### Building Trust Remotely

- Deliver consistently
- Communicate proactively
- Be reliable and responsive
- Make extra effort to connect personally

## Red Flags in Work Relationships

Not everyone is worth investing in. Watch for:

- People who take but never give
- Those who gossip excessively
- Anyone who undermines colleagues
- People who violate confidence
- Those who consistently negative
- Anyone who asks you to do inappropriate things

You can be professional with everyone while being selective about who you invest in deeply.

## Making the Transition Easier

### Find Other Veterans

- Join the veteran employee resource group (ERG)
- Look for veterans on LinkedIn at your company
- Ask HR if there are veteran support programs
- Connect with veterans even outside your team

### Get a Mentor

- Someone who's navigated the organization
- Ask them about relationship dynamics
- Learn who to invest in and who to be cautious with
- Get feedback on how you're perceived

### Be Patient

- Civilian relationships take longer—that's normal
- Don't judge too quickly (positive or negative)
- Give yourself grace during the adjustment
- Trust builds over months, not days

*The camaraderie you built in the military was forged in unique circumstances. Civilian workplace relationships are different—slower to form, based on different dynamics, and no less valuable once developed. Invest intentionally, be patient, and trust that meaningful connections will come. The relationships you build now will shape your entire civilian career.*
