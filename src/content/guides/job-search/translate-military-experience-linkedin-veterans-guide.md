# How to Translate Military Experience on LinkedIn

## Bottom Line Up Front

Civilian recruiters spend 7 seconds scanning your LinkedIn profile. If they hit "11B" or "NCO" and don't understand it, they move on. This guide gives you the exact translations and frameworks to convert any military experience into language that gets interviews. You'll learn the translation formula, see 100+ examples, and understand which military terms to keep vs. eliminate.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The translation problem is the #1 reason qualified veterans don't get interviews:
- 87% of recruiters have no military background
- Military acronyms immediately confuse civilian readers
- Translated experience shows 3x higher engagement on LinkedIn
- Proper translation connects your skills to their job descriptions

You could be the perfect candidate, but if your profile reads like a military brief, you'll never get the call.

## The Translation Framework

Use this three-step process for every piece of military experience:

### Step 1: Eliminate Jargon
Remove or translate:
- Military acronyms (MOS, TDY, PCS, etc.)
- Rank structures (E-5, O-3, etc.)
- Unit designations (2/75 RGR, 1-187 IN, etc.)
- Military-specific terms (NCOER, ETS, etc.)

### Step 2: Find the Civilian Equivalent
Ask yourself:
- What would this job be called in a corporation?
- What skills did I use that exist in civilian jobs?
- What results did I achieve that civilians would care about?

### Step 3: Quantify Everything
Add numbers to show scale:
- Team size
- Budget managed
- Equipment/asset value
- Percentage improvements
- Timeline achievements

## What to Keep vs. Remove

### Keep These Terms (Civilians Know Them)
- U.S. Army/Navy/Air Force/Marines/Coast Guard
- Veteran
- Active Duty
- Deployment (but explain context)
- Security Clearance levels (TS/SCI, Secret)
- Drill Sergeant (recognized leadership)
- Basic Training/Boot Camp (but translate what you taught)

### Always Remove or Translate
- MOS numbers (11B, 0311, etc.)
- Unit designations (2nd BCT, VFA-192)
- Military acronyms (NCOER, APFT, UCMJ)
- Rank abbreviations (SSG, SGT, CPL)
- Military slang (high speed, ate up, etc.)
- Internal systems (unless civilian equivalent exists)

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Assuming everyone knows military terms** - They don't. "NCO" means nothing to most recruiters.

2. **Over-explaining deployments** - Focus on skills used, not combat details.

3. **Underselling leadership experience** - A Sergeant leads more people than many corporate managers.

4. **Using military dates** - Write "January 2020 - December 2022" not "JAN20-DEC22"

5. **Keeping unit numbers** - "3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division" → "U.S. Army Airborne Division"

6. **Not quantifying achievements** - Numbers translate universally. Always include them.

7. **Describing duties instead of accomplishments** - "Was responsible for" → "Achieved, Delivered, Improved"
