# How to List Security Clearance on Your Resume

## Bottom Line Up Front

A security clearance is a significant competitive advantage—worth $5,000-$15,000 to employers in saved investigation costs. But listing it incorrectly can hurt you or violate security protocols. This guide shows you exactly how to present your clearance: what to include, where to place it, what to avoid, and how to leverage it in your job search.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Clearance value for employers:
- **TS/SCI:** Costs $3,000-$15,000 and 6-12 months to obtain
- **Secret:** Costs $400-$3,000 and 1-3 months to obtain
- **Pre-cleared candidates can start immediately**

Veterans with active clearances are in high demand:
- Defense contractors require cleared personnel
- Federal agencies need cleared candidates
- Some private companies value clearance for sensitive work
- Clearance indicates trustworthiness and background check completion

The challenge: Presenting clearance appropriately without security violations.

## Understanding Clearance Types

### Clearance Levels

**Confidential:**
- Lowest level
- Less common and less valuable
- 15-year reinvestigation cycle

**Secret:**
- Most common military clearance
- Moderate value to employers
- 10-year reinvestigation cycle

**Top Secret (TS):**
- High value to employers
- Significant competitive advantage
- 5-year reinvestigation cycle

**TS/SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information):**
- Top Secret with SCI access
- Highest value
- Enables access to most sensitive programs

### Additional Access Types

**SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information):**
- Access to compartmented programs
- Requires Top Secret as base

**SAP (Special Access Programs):**
- Access to specific programs
- Don't list program names publicly

**Polygraph:**
- CI Poly (Counter-Intelligence)
- Full Scope (Lifestyle)
- Adds value, can be mentioned

## What to Include

### Clearance Level

Clearly state:
- Confidential
- Secret
- Top Secret
- TS/SCI

### Clearance Status

Indicate whether clearance is:
- **Active:** Currently valid and in use
- **Current:** Valid but may not be actively used
- **Inactive:** Was active, now in deactivated status

### Investigation Date

Include when helpful:
- Last investigation date
- Shows how recent the clearance is
- Particularly valuable if recent (within 5 years)

### Polygraph (If Applicable)

If you have polygraph, state type:
- "CI Polygraph"
- "Full Scope Polygraph"
- Don't provide details about polygraph content

## What NOT to Include

### Never Disclose

**Specific programs:**
- Don't name classified programs
- Don't describe classified work
- Don't mention codewords

**Investigation details:**
- Don't describe investigation process
- Don't mention issues that arose
- Don't list agencies that investigated

**Classified locations:**
- Don't identify classified facilities by name
- Use general descriptions instead

### Avoid

**Expired clearance status:**
- If clearance is truly expired (2+ years inactive), don't list it
- "Previously held Secret clearance" adds little value

**Unofficial terminology:**
- Don't invent clearance terms
- Stick to standard designations

## Clearance Verification

### What Employers Can Verify

Employers with facility clearance can verify:
- Whether you have a clearance
- Current status
- Level of access
- Through DISS (Defense Information System for Security)

### What You Should Know

**Your clearance status:**
- Check via your Security Manager
- Know your investigation date
- Know your status (active, current, inactive)

**If separating soon:**
- Clearance remains for up to 24 months after leaving cleared position
- Status moves from "active" to "current" when not actively used
- Reinvestigation easier than new investigation

### DISS Access

Veterans can check their clearance status:
- Contact your last security office
- Some transition centers can help
- Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) replaced by DISS

## Clearance Status Definitions

### Active

- Currently valid
- Associated with active position
- Immediately usable

**How to list:** "Active" or "Current Active"

### Current

- Valid but not actively used
- Can be transferred to new employer
- Doesn't require new investigation

**How to list:** "Current" or "Valid"

### Inactive

- Was active, now deactivated
- May be reactivatable (within 24 months)
- Check with security office

**How to list:** "Inactive (eligible for reactivation)" or don't list

### Expired

- No longer valid (2+ years)
- Requires new investigation
- Little value to list

**How to list:** Don't list, or "Previously held [Level]" with explanation

### Clearance as Negotiating Leverage

Your clearance has monetary value:
- **Use it in negotiation:** "I understand cleared candidates are in high demand..."
- **It's a differentiator:** Emphasize immediate start capability
- **It reduces employer risk:** They know you're background-checked

### Sponsoring Clearance vs. Transferring

**Transferring (you have clearance):**
- Quick process
- No investigation needed
- Employer incurs minimal cost

**Sponsoring (no clearance):**
- 3-12+ months
- $3,000-$15,000 cost
- Employer takes risk

Emphasize your ability to transfer existing clearance immediately.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Oversharing

**Wrong:**
"Held TS/SCI with access to XYZ Program at [classified facility], involved in operations including..."

**Right:**
"TS/SCI (Active)"

Keep it simple. Don't discuss specifics.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Terminology

**Wrong:**
- "High security clearance"
- "Government clearance"
- "Military clearance Level 5"

**Right:**
- "Secret" or "Top Secret" or "TS/SCI"

Use standard terms only.

### Mistake 3: Listing Expired Clearance Prominently

**Wrong:**
"Security Clearance: Secret (Expired 2019)"

**Right:**
Don't list expired clearances prominently. If mentioned at all, note in context of military service.

### Mistake 4: Misrepresenting Status

**Wrong:**
Claiming "Active" when clearance is inactive

**Right:**
Be honest about status. Employers will verify.

### Mistake 5: Omitting Clearance Entirely

**Wrong:**
Not mentioning clearance on resume for cleared position

**Right:**
Clearly state clearance for any position that requires it.

### Mistake 6: Forgetting LinkedIn

**Wrong:**
Resume shows clearance, LinkedIn doesn't

**Right:**
Consistent clearance information across all platforms

## FAQ

### "My clearance is about to expire. Should I mention it?"

If you're within the 5-year reinvestigation window and clearance is active, list it normally. If you're past reinvestigation date but still within 24 months of last active use, you may note "eligible for reinvestigation."

### "I had an incident but kept my clearance. Do I mention it?"

No. If you retained your clearance, list it normally. Don't volunteer negative information.

### "I'm separating soon. How long is my clearance good?"

Generally, 24 months from when you leave your cleared position. After that, it typically expires. Check with your security office for your specific situation.

### "Can I mention clearance for non-cleared jobs?"

Yes, if relevant. A clearance indicates you've passed extensive background checks, which can be valuable for sensitive (but not classified) roles. But prioritize other qualifications for non-cleared positions.

### "Should I mention SAP access?"

You can mention you held SAP access without naming the programs. "Held Special Access Program authorizations" is acceptable.
