# How to Use Alumni Networks for Job Search

## Bottom Line Up Front

You have more alumni connections than you realize. Beyond college alumni, veterans have military schools, training programs, and professional education that create instant rapport with fellow graduates. This guide shows you how to identify, activate, and leverage all your alumni networks for job search success.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Alumni networks work because:
- Shared experience creates instant connection
- Alumni want to help fellow alumni
- "Cold" outreach becomes "warm" outreach
- Organizations have formal alumni support programs

Veterans have unique alumni opportunities:
- Military schools (OCS, BOLC, NCO academies, specialty schools)
- Service academies
- ROTC programs
- Professional military education (War College, Staff College)
- Plus civilian education

Most veterans underutilize these networks because they don't think of military education as "alumni."
