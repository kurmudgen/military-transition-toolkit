# How to Connect with Recruiters on LinkedIn as a Veteran

## Bottom Line Up Front

Recruiters are paid to find candidates—they want to connect with you. But most veterans either avoid recruiters or reach out ineffectively. This guide teaches you how to find the right recruiters, make connections that stick, and turn recruiter relationships into interviews. You'll get templates, timing strategies, and insider knowledge on how recruiters actually work.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Understanding recruiters accelerates your job search:
- 87% of recruiters use LinkedIn as their primary sourcing tool
- Recruiters can fast-track you past initial screening
- Good recruiter relationships lead to multiple opportunities
- Veterans' profiles often get overlooked due to translation issues

Recruiters aren't gatekeepers—they're matchmakers. They succeed when you succeed. Understanding their perspective helps you work together effectively.

## Working with Multiple Recruiters

### Why Work with Multiple

- Different recruiters have different clients
- Expands your opportunities
- No exclusivity expected

### How to Manage Multiple Recruiters

**Track everything:**
- Which roles each submits you for
- Which companies each represents
- Communication history

**Be transparent:**
- If already submitted to a company, tell other recruiters
- If interviewing somewhere, mention it
- Never let two recruiters submit you for the same role

**Warning:** If two recruiters submit you for the same role, it creates confusion and can disqualify you. Always ask: "Has [Company] already received my resume?"

## What to Ask Recruiters

### During Initial Conversation

- What types of roles do you typically fill?
- What industries or companies do you work with?
- What's the typical timeline for your roles?
- What do you look for in candidates?
- How do you prefer to communicate?

### About Specific Opportunities

- What's the salary range for this role?
- Why is the position open?
- What's the interview process like?
- What's the timeline for hiring?
- What does the hiring manager prioritize?
- What happened to previous candidates?

### About Your Candidacy

- How does my background compare to other candidates?
- What could strengthen my application?
- What concerns might the hiring manager have?
- How should I prepare for the interview?
- What feedback have you heard about candidates from my background?

## Red Flags to Watch

### Recruiter Red Flags

- Won't share company name or job details upfront
- Pressures you to accept roles you don't want
- Asks you to pay fees (legitimate recruiters are paid by employers)
- Makes promises that seem too good
- Doesn't listen to your preferences

### How to Handle

- Ask direct questions about their process
- Trust your instincts
- Never pay to be placed
- Work with multiple recruiters to compare experiences

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Avoiding recruiters entirely** - They're valuable allies, not obstacles.

2. **Treating all recruiters the same** - Internal, agency, and military-focused recruiters work differently.

3. **Not following up** - Recruiters are busy; polite follow-up is expected.

4. **Being passive** - "Let me know if anything comes up" doesn't work.

5. **Not being honest about fit** - Wastes everyone's time.

6. **Forgetting to check submission** - Getting double-submitted to companies causes problems.

7. **Burning bridges** - Recruiting is a small world. Professionalism matters.

## Special Situations

### No Response After Multiple Attempts

Move on. Not every recruiter will be a fit. Focus energy on more responsive relationships.

### Recruiter Ghosted After Interview

Follow up once, then move on. It's unprofessional on their part but common.

### Bad Experience with Agency

Work with different agencies. Quality varies widely.

### Recruiter Wants Exclusivity

Be cautious. Most legitimate recruiters don't require exclusivity. If they do, ensure time limits and specific terms.

## Real Examples

### Cold Outreach Success

**Week 1:** Connected with 10 recruiters in target industry
**Week 2:** 4 accepted, followed up with all
**Week 3:** Phone call with 2 recruiters
**Week 4:** Submitted for 3 roles by different recruiters
**Week 5:** 2 interviews scheduled
**Result:** Job offer through agency recruiter relationship

### Building Long-Term Relationship

**Month 1:** Connected with veteran-focused recruiter, no immediate fit
**Month 3:** Recruiter reached out about new role, not quite right
**Month 5:** Recruiter submitted me for ideal role
**Result:** Hired through recruiter who remembered me
