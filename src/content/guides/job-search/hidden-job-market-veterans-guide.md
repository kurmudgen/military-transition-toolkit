# Hidden Job Market: How Veterans Find Unadvertised Jobs

## Bottom Line Up Front

Up to 80% of jobs are never publicly posted. They're filled through internal referrals, networking, and direct outreach before reaching job boards. Veterans who only apply to posted jobs miss most opportunities. This guide teaches you how to access the hidden job market through strategic networking, direct outreach, and relationship building.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The hidden job market exists because:
- Hiring managers prefer referrals (4x more likely to be hired)
- Companies save money avoiding job postings and recruiters
- Internal candidates know the culture and hit the ground running
- Posting attracts hundreds of applications to sort through

Veterans face unique challenges:
- Military networks don't translate directly to civilian jobs
- You may not know anyone at target companies
- Networking feels uncomfortable to many veterans
- The system isn't taught in TAP/TAPS programs

But veterans also have advantages:
- Veteran affinity creates instant rapport
- Companies actively want to hire veterans
- Your network is larger than you think
- Military reputation precedes you

## Understanding the Hidden Job Market

### What "Hidden" Means

**Not posted publicly:**
- Internal-only job postings
- Positions filled before posting
- Roles created for specific people
- Positions in planning but not yet approved

**Not obviously accessible:**
- Jobs shared through personal networks
- Positions mentioned at industry events
- Opportunities discussed informally
- Roles communicated through recruiters to select candidates

### Why Jobs Stay Hidden

**Cost savings:**
- Job board fees: $200-$500 per posting
- Recruiter fees: 15-25% of salary
- Screening hundreds of applications: 20+ hours

**Quality preference:**
- Referred candidates perform better
- Cultural fit is more predictable
- Background is already known
- Faster time to productivity

**Speed:**
- Internal candidates start immediately
- No application screening needed
- Interview process is shorter
- Decisions are faster

## Strategy 1: Network Activation

### Your Existing Network

**Start with who you know:**
- Former military colleagues (where do they work now?)
- Family and friends (who do they know?)
- Alumni from schools and training
- Previous civilian employers
- Religious and community connections

### The Network Audit

Make a list of everyone you know:

**Military contacts:**
- Former commanders and supervisors
- Peers from various assignments
- Subordinates who've transitioned
- Training classmates
- Joint assignment colleagues

**Personal contacts:**
- Family members (and their spouses)
- Neighbors (current and former)
- Friends from before military
- Spouse's network
- Children's friends' parents

**Community contacts:**
- Church/religious community
- Volunteer organizations
- Sports teams and clubs
- Professional associations
- Alumni groups

### Activating Your Network

**Let people know you're looking:**

```
Hey [Name],

I'm transitioning from [X] years in the [Branch] and actively looking for [type of role] opportunities. I know you work at [Company/Industry] and wanted to reach out.

Would you be open to a quick call to share any insights about your industry? And if you know of any opportunities or people I should connect with, I'd really appreciate the introduction.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**The "Weak Ties" Power:**
Research shows loose connections (friends of friends) often provide better job leads than close contacts. Your close contacts know the same people you do. Weak ties access different networks.

## Strategy 2: Target Company Approach

### Identify Target Companies

**Create your list:**
- 20-30 companies you'd like to work for
- Mix of sizes and types
- Research military-friendly employers

**Research criteria:**
- Do they hire veterans?
- Do they have positions matching your skills?
- Where are they located?
- What's their culture like?
- Are they growing?

### Find Your Way In

**For each target company:**

1. **Search LinkedIn for veterans at the company**
   - Search: "[Company name] veteran"
   - Search: "[Company name] Army/Navy/etc."

2. **Find alumni connections**
   - Same school, same military school, same unit

3. **Identify hiring managers**
   - Search for managers in your target department
   - Connect with their teams

4. **Find recruiters**
   - Search: "[Company name] recruiter talent acquisition"

### Outreach Sequence

**Step 1: Connect with veterans at the company**
```
Hi [Name], I'm a fellow [Branch] veteran looking at opportunities at [Company]. I'd love to connect and hear about your experience there.
```

**Step 2: Build the relationship**
- Ask about their role and the company
- Learn about culture and opportunities
- Offer value where you can

**Step 3: Ask for guidance**
```
I'm targeting [type of role] at [Company]. Based on what you know, who would be the best person for me to talk to? And would you be comfortable making an introduction?
```

**Step 4: Get introduced or referred**
- Warm introductions are powerful
- Ask if they can refer you when positions open
- Stay connected for future opportunities

## Strategy 3: Informational Interviews

### What Informational Interviews Are

**Not job interviews:**
- You're gathering information, not asking for a job
- Learning about industries, roles, companies
- Building relationships

**Why they work:**
- 85% of jobs come through networking
- People like helping veterans
- You become top of mind when opportunities arise

### Requesting Informational Interviews

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm a [Branch] veteran transitioning to [industry/function] and researching my career options. I came across your profile and was impressed by your background in [specific area].

Would you have 20 minutes in the next few weeks for a phone call? I'd love to learn about your career path and any advice you might have for someone entering the field.

I'm not asking for a job—just looking to learn from people who've been successful in [industry].

Thanks for considering,
[Your name]
```

### During the Interview

**Questions to ask:**
- How did you get into this field?
- What's a typical day like in your role?
- What skills are most important for success?
- What trends are shaping the industry?
- What do you wish you'd known starting out?
- What companies would you recommend I research?
- Who else should I talk to?

**Always end with:**
"Is there anyone else you'd recommend I speak with?"

This keeps your network expanding.

### After the Interview

**Follow up within 24 hours:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for your time today. Your insights about [specific topic] were really helpful. I'm going to follow up on your suggestion to [specific action].

I'll keep you posted on my progress, and please let me know if I can ever return the favor.

Best,
[Your name]

## Strategy 4: Direct Hiring Manager Contact

### Finding Hiring Managers

**LinkedIn search:**

- "[Department] director [company name]"
- "[Team] lead [company name]"

**Company website:**
- Leadership pages
- Team bios
- Press releases

**Industry events:**
- Speaker lists
- Attendee networking
- Panel participants

### Approaching Hiring Managers

**The "Value First" Approach:**

Don't lead with asking for a job. Lead with offering value.

```
Hi [Name],

I came across your team's work on [specific project/initiative] and was impressed by [specific aspect]. As a [Branch] veteran with experience in [relevant area], I've worked on similar challenges and would love to learn more about your approach.

Would you have 15 minutes for a call? I promise to be respectful of your time.

[Your name]
```

**The "Specific Interest" Approach:**

Show you've done your research.

```
Hi [Name],

I've been researching [Company] as part of my transition from [X] years in the [Branch], and your team's focus on [specific area] aligns well with my background in [relevant experience].

I'm not reaching out about a specific posting—I'm interested in learning more about where [Company] is heading and whether my skills might be valuable.

Would you be open to a brief conversation?

[Your name]
```

### If No Response

**Follow up once after one week:**
```
Hi [Name],

Just following up on my previous message. I understand you're busy—if now isn't a good time, I'd be happy to connect whenever works for you.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**If still no response:**
Move on. Not everyone will respond, and that's okay.

```

## Strategy 7: Company Research Reveals Opportunities

### Signs of Hidden Opportunities

**Growth indicators:**
- Press releases about expansion
- New office openings

```
"I noticed [Company]'s recent announcement about [expansion/initiative]. As a veteran with experience in [relevant area], I'm interested in how my skills might contribute to this growth..."
```
3. **Ask about opportunities before they're posted**

## Building a Hidden Job Market System

- Engage with content from hiring managers
- Send 2-3 connection requests
- Follow up on pending conversations

### Weekly Actions (2-3 hours)

### Monthly Review

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Only Applying to Posted Jobs

Posted jobs are just the tip of the iceberg. Diversify your approach.

### Mistake 2: Asking for a Job Too Soon

Build relationships before asking. People help those they know and like.

### Mistake 3: Being Too Broad

"I'm looking for any opportunity" doesn't help anyone help you. Be specific.

### Mistake 4: Not Following Up

One message isn't enough. Follow up respectfully and consistently.

### Mistake 5: Neglecting Your Existing Network

Your current network is valuable. Don't only seek new connections.

### Mistake 6: Transactional Networking

Relationships work both ways. Offer value, not just requests.
