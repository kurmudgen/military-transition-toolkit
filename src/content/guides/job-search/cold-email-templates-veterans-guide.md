# Cold Email Templates for Veterans Reaching Out to Companies

## Bottom Line Up Front

Cold emails work when done right. The key is providing value, showing relevance, and making it easy to respond. This guide provides tested email templates for every situation veterans encounter during job search—from initial outreach to follow-ups, with customization tips and best practices.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Cold email advantages:
- Reaches people who aren't on LinkedIn
- More professional than social media DMs
- Creates a record for reference
- Higher response rates than applications alone

Veterans can leverage:
- Veteran identity creates connection
- Military experience shows reliability
- Unique backgrounds generate curiosity
- Respect for service opens doors

## Cold Email Fundamentals

### Anatomy of Effective Cold Emails

**Subject line:** Get them to open (3-8 words)
**Opening:** Hook them immediately (1-2 sentences)
**Body:** Provide context and value (3-5 sentences)
**Ask:** Clear, specific request (1 sentence)
**Close:** Make it easy to respond (1-2 sentences)

### Key Principles

1. **Keep it short** - Under 150 words ideal
2. **Be specific** - Generic emails get deleted
3. **Provide value** - What's in it for them?
4. **Make action easy** - Clear next step
5. **Be professional** - But human

### Subject Line Best Practices

**Effective subject lines:**
- Include the job title or specific topic
- Keep under 8 words
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, URGENT)
- Personalize when possible

**Examples:**

- "Quick Question About [Company] Engineering Team"
- "Referred by [Name] - Project Manager Position"
- "[Mutual Connection] Suggested I Reach Out"
