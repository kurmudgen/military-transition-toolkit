# LinkedIn Headline Examples for Transitioning Service Members

## Bottom Line Up Front

Your LinkedIn headline has 220 characters to make recruiters stop scrolling. The default "Sergeant at U.S. Army" gets ignored. This guide provides 50+ headline templates organized by target industry and military background. Copy, customize, and start attracting opportunities today.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Your headline appears in:
- Search results (how recruiters find you)
- Connection requests
- Comments you make on posts

## Keywords Recruiters Search For

Include these in your headline where relevant:

**Clearance-Related:**
- TS/SCI
- Secret Clearance
- Active Clearance
- Cleared Professional

**Certifications:**
- PMP
- Six Sigma
- CISSP
- Security+
- AWS Certified

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Default headline** - "Sergeant at U.S. Army" tells recruiters nothing about your future goals.

2. **Too humble** - "Looking for opportunities" is weak. State what you do.

3. **All military jargon** - "Former 11B NCO seeking opportunities" doesn't translate.

4. **Too long without focus** - Don't try to include everything. Pick your best elements.

5. **No target role** - Without a target, recruiters don't know where you fit.

6. **Missing keywords** - If you have PMP, TS/SCI, or other credentials, include them.

7. **Generic statements** - "Hard worker" and "team player" are meaningless. Be specific.
