# "Tell Me About Yourself" - Perfect Answer for Veterans

## Bottom Line Up Front

"Tell me about yourself" is the most important interview question—and the one veterans most often get wrong. This guide provides the exact formula for structuring your answer, examples by military background, and scripts you can customize. Nail this question and you set a positive tone for the entire interview.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

This question matters because:
- It's almost always asked first
- Sets the tone for the interview
- Your only chance to frame the narrative
- Determines interviewer's first impression

Veterans struggle because:
- Military jargon doesn't translate
- Tendency to give chronological life history
- Modesty conflicts with self-promotion
- Unsure how much military to include

The perfect answer is prepared, practiced, and precisely targeted to the role.

## What They're Really Asking

### Not Asking
- Your life story
- Your childhood
- Everything you've ever done
- Why you joined the military

### Actually Asking
- Why should I keep listening?
- Are you a fit for this role?
- Can you communicate effectively?
- What value do you bring?

### What Good Answers Do
- Connect your background to the role
- Highlight relevant experience
- Show you understand their needs
- Create interest for deeper questions

## The Formula

### The Present-Past-Future Formula

**Present (30%):** Where you are now
**Past (40%):** Relevant background
**Future (30%):** Why you're here and what you want

### Timing

- **60-90 seconds** is ideal
- Under 60 seconds feels incomplete
- Over 2 minutes loses attention
- Practice with a timer

### Structure

```
[Present - 20 seconds]
"I'm a [description] with [X years] of experience in [relevant area]..."

[Past - 40 seconds]
"In my military career, I [most relevant experiences]. I particularly excelled at [transferable skills]. For example, [brief concrete example]..."

[Future - 30 seconds]
"Now I'm looking to [transition goal]. I'm excited about [this role/company] because [specific reason]. My experience in [skill] would help me [contribute to their needs]."

**Right:**
Jump to relevant experience and keep it focused.

Five-minute monologue covering everything.

## Practice Exercise

Using the formula, write your answer. Don't worry about length—just get it all down.

### Step 2: Edit Ruthlessly

Cut anything that doesn't directly support why you're right for THIS role.

### Step 3: Time It

Read aloud with a timer. Aim for 60-90 seconds.

Say it until it sounds natural, not memorized.

### Step 5: Get Feedback

Ask someone to listen and tell you:

## Variations

### "Walk Me Through Your Resume"

Use the same formula but in slightly more detail, touching on each position. Still stay focused on what's relevant.

### "What's Your Background?"

Same as "Tell me about yourself." Use the formula.

### "Tell Me About Your Military Experience"

Focus on the "Past" section with more detail, but still connect to why it matters for this role.

### "Why Are You Transitioning?"

Positive framing only:
"I'm excited to apply what I've learned in a new context. After [X] years, I'm ready to [growth goal]. The skills I developed in [area] translate well to [civilian field], and I'm energized by [specific aspect of new career]."
