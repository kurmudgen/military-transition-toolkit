# 90-Day Plan for Veterans in New Civilian Job

## Bottom Line Up Front

Your first 90 days in a civilian job set the trajectory for your entire career at that organization. This is when impressions are formed, relationships are built, and your reputation is established. Veterans often struggle during this period—culture shock, unfamiliar expectations, and the absence of military structure can be disorienting. This guide provides a week-by-week plan to succeed in your first 90 days, with specific actions for learning, contributing, and building relationships. Execute this plan, and you'll be positioned for long-term success.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The first 90 days are critical because:
- First impressions are lasting and hard to change
- Early relationships shape your entire tenure
- Initial contributions build or undermine confidence
- Culture adaptation happens (or doesn't) in this window
- Most employers evaluate new hires at 90 days

Veterans face specific challenges:
- Culture shock from military to civilian transition
- Unfamiliar workplace norms and expectations
- No clear rank or role structure to rely on
- Different communication and decision-making styles
- Need to prove themselves in a new environment

This plan gives you structure during an unstructured time.
