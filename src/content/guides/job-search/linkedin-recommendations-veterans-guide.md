# LinkedIn Recommendations: What to Ask For and From Whom

## Bottom Line Up Front

LinkedIn recommendations are social proof that you deliver results. Unlike endorsements (one-click), recommendations are written testimonials visible to every recruiter who views your profile. Veterans often have stellar service records but zero recommendations. This guide shows you exactly who to ask, how to ask, and what to request—with templates that make it easy for recommenders to write something powerful.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Recommendations impact your job search because:
- 87% of recruiters check recommendations during evaluation
- Profiles with recommendations get 14x more profile views
- Written testimonials carry more weight than self-descriptions
- Third-party validation builds trust with hiring managers

Veterans face specific challenges:
- Military leaders may not know LinkedIn well
- Civilian contacts are limited during transition
- We're uncomfortable asking for praise
- Our accomplishments deserve better documentation than military evaluations provide

## Who to Ask for Recommendations

### Tier 1: Former Military Leaders (Most Valuable)

**Who:**
- Former commanders/supervisors
- Senior NCOs who supervised you
- Officers you worked for directly
- Warrant officers in your specialty

**Why valuable:**
- Can speak to leadership in high-pressure environments
- Validate military accomplishments in civilian terms
- Carry weight as senior leaders
- Know specific examples of your performance

### Tier 2: Military Peers and Colleagues

**Who:**
- Fellow officers/NCOs at your level
- Peers from joint assignments
- Colleagues from professional military education
- Team members who saw your work

**Why valuable:**
- Speak to collaboration and teamwork
- Can address day-to-day work ethic
- Provide peer validation
- Often easier to get than senior leaders

### Tier 3: Subordinates (If Applicable)

**Who:**
- Service members you led directly
- Personnel you trained or mentored
- Team members who worked for you

**Why valuable:**
- Shows leadership from the follower's perspective
- Demonstrates how you treat and develop people
- Powerful counterbalance to senior recommendations

### Tier 4: Civilian Contacts

**Who:**
- Internship supervisors (SkillBridge, etc.)
- Volunteer organization leaders
- Civilian instructors or mentors
- Contractors you worked with
- ACP mentors

**Why valuable:**
- Provide civilian vocabulary and perspective
- Bridge military and civilian worlds
- Show you function well in civilian environments

### Tier 5: Professional Contacts

**Who:**
- Industry mentors
- Networking contacts who know your work
- Professional association colleagues
- Career coaches or counselors

**Why valuable:**
- Industry credibility
- Demonstrate professional network
- Can speak to industry-relevant skills

## How Many Recommendations to Get

### Minimum Target: 3-5

**Ideal mix:**
- 2 from military leadership
- 1 from military peer
- 1-2 from civilian contacts (if available)

### Stretch Target: 7-10

For senior roles or competitive industries, more recommendations strengthen your profile.

### Quality Over Quantity

One detailed, specific recommendation beats five generic ones. Focus on getting substantive recommendations, not just numbers.

## How to Ask: The Process

### Step 1: Make a List

Write down everyone who could recommend you:
- All supervisors from last 5-10 years
- Peers who saw your best work
- Anyone you mentored successfully
- Civilian contacts during service

### Step 2: Reconnect First

If you haven't talked recently, reach out before asking:

```
Hey [Name],

I hope you're doing well. I'm [current situation - transitioning, job searching, etc.] and wanted to reconnect. It would be great to catch up when you have time.

[Your name]
```

Wait for response before asking for recommendation.

### Step 3: Make the Ask

**Key principles:**
- Make it easy for them
- Be specific about what you want highlighted
- Offer to draft something for them to edit
- Give them an out (no pressure)

### Step 4: Provide Guidance

The more specific you are, the better the recommendation. Tell them:
- What role you're targeting
- Which skills/accomplishments to highlight
- Specific examples they could mention
- Any civilian terms to use

### Step 5: Follow Up

If they agree but don't write it:
- Wait 1-2 weeks
- Send a gentle reminder
- Offer to draft it for them again

### Step 6: Thank Them

After they write the recommendation:
- Send a personal thank you
- Offer to recommend them in return
- Keep them updated on your job search

## What Makes a Good Recommendation

### Elements of Powerful Recommendations

1. **Specific examples** - Not "great leader" but "led team through specific challenge"
2. **Quantified results** - Numbers make accomplishments concrete
3. **Character traits** - Work ethic, integrity, teamwork
4. **Context** - Explains the difficulty or significance
5. **Civilian language** - Translated, not military jargon
6. **Strong close** - Clear endorsement statement

### Before and After Example

**Weak:**
"John was a great soldier. He always did his job well and was reliable. I would recommend him for any position."

**Strong:**
"I supervised John for two years while he managed logistics for our 500-person organization. He transformed our supply operations, reducing equipment shortages by 40% and saving over $200K through improved inventory management. John's calm leadership during our deployment—where he coordinated support for operations across three locations—earned him recognition from senior commanders. He develops his team members, with three of his direct reports promoted under his mentorship. Any organization would benefit from John's operational expertise and leadership. He has my strongest recommendation."

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Never asking** - Pride prevents veterans from seeking recommendations they deserve.

2. **Generic requests** - "Can you recommend me?" without guidance gets weak results.

3. **Wrong people** - Asking contacts who don't know your work well.

4. **Not providing context** - Recommenders don't know your career goals.

5. **Forgetting civilians** - Only military recommendations limits your appeal.

6. **Not following up** - Letting requests die without gentle reminders.

7. **Not reciprocating** - Taking without giving damages relationships.

## Real Examples

### Before Requesting

**Profile:** 500 connections, complete profile, zero recommendations.

**Perception:** "This veteran looks qualified but has no validation."

### After 5 Targeted Recommendations

**Recommendations include:**
- Former battalion commander (speaks to leadership at scale)
- Senior NCO supervisor (validates technical and leadership skills)
- Military peer (demonstrates teamwork and collaboration)
- SkillBridge supervisor (proves civilian workplace success)

**Perception:** "This veteran has validated accomplishments and is recommended by multiple credible sources."
