# Informational Interview Guide for Veterans

## Bottom Line Up Front

Informational interviews are the most underutilized tool in job search. They're not job interviews—they're conversations that build relationships, provide insights, and often lead to opportunities. This guide teaches you how to request, conduct, and follow up on informational interviews that generate career momentum.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Informational interviews are valuable because:
- 85% of jobs are filled through networking
- People who help you once want to help you again
- Insider knowledge improves your applications
- Conversations lead to referrals

Veterans benefit especially because:
- Learn how military experience translates
- Understand civilian workplace culture
- Build network in target industry
- Get advice specific to your transition

Military culture makes us uncomfortable asking for help. But civilians expect networking—and informational interviews are normal.

## What Informational Interviews Are (and Aren't)

### What They Are

- **Learning conversations** - You're gathering information
- **Relationship building** - Creating allies for your search
- **Industry education** - Understanding how things work
- **Resume research** - Learning what employers want

### What They're Not

- **Job interviews** - Don't ask for a job
- **Thinly veiled pitches** - Genuine curiosity required
- **Favors to collect on** - Value the conversation itself
- **One-time transactions** - Build lasting relationships

## Who to Request Informational Interviews With

### Ideal Candidates

**Veterans who've made similar transitions:**
- Same branch/MOS to similar role
- Transitioned 1-5 years ago (fresh perspective)
- Now in your target industry/function

**Professionals in target roles:**
- People doing the job you want
- Managers who hire for these roles
- Successful people in target industry

**Alumni connections:**
- Same schools (civilian and military)
- Same military units/assignments
- Same certifications

**Second-degree connections:**
- Friends of friends
- Your contact's contacts
- People who receive warm introductions

### Less Ideal (But Still Valuable)

- People too senior (busy, removed from day-to-day)
- People who just started (limited perspective)
- People in different functions than your target

## How to Request an Informational Interview

### Finding People

**LinkedIn search:**
- "[Target role] [industry/company]"
- Filter by veteran, alumni, mutual connections

**Your network:**
- Ask contacts: "Who do you know that does [role]?"
- Request introductions

**Events and groups:**
- Professional associations
- Veteran networking groups
- Industry meetups

### Request Best Practices

**Keep it short** - Under 100 words
**Be specific** - About why them
**Ask for little** - 15-20 minutes
**Make it easy** - Offer flexibility

## Conducting the Interview

- Explain what you're hoping to learn

**Their story (5-10 minutes):**
- Let them share their background
- Listen actively
- Ask follow-up questions

- Work through prepared questions
- Be flexible—follow interesting threads
- Take notes (ask permission)

### Sample Opening

"Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. As I mentioned, I'm transitioning from [X] years in the [Branch] and exploring [field]. I've done some research but really wanted to learn from someone who's been successful in this space. I have a few questions prepared, but I'd love to start by hearing a bit about your career journey."

**Near the end:**
- "Based on what you know about my background, what advice would you give me?"
- "Is there anyone else you'd recommend I speak with?"
- "Would it be okay if I followed up with you as I progress?"

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't ask for a job** - This isn't a job interview
- **Don't overstay** - Respect the time limit
- **Don't talk more than listen** - Ratio should be 70/30 them
- **Don't skip the preparation** - Wasting their time damages relationship
- **Don't forget to follow up** - Critical for relationship building

## After the Interview

### Immediate Follow-Up (Within 24 Hours)

**Send thank you email:**

```
Subject: Thank You - Great Speaking With You

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for your time today. Our conversation about [specific topic] was incredibly valuable.

I'm going to follow up on your suggestions to [specific action—e.g., research a company, pursue a certification, reach out to someone]. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

If there's ever anything I can do to return the favor, please let me know.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Connect on LinkedIn (If Not Already)

Include a note: "Great speaking with you today. Thanks again for your insights about [topic]."

### Take Action on Their Suggestions

If they recommended:
- Someone to talk to → Reach out
- A certification → Research it
- A company to look at → Research it

Then update them on what you did.

### Long-Term Relationship Building

**After 4-6 weeks:**
Send a brief update on your progress. Reference their advice.

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up and share an update. Since we spoke, I [action you took—got the certification, applied to the companies, had conversations with people they referred].

[Brief result or learning]

I really appreciate your guidance. I'll keep you posted as things develop.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**When something happens:**
Let them know if their advice paid off—interview, job offer, etc. People want to know their help mattered.

### If They Referred You to Someone

When reaching out:
"Hi [New Name], [Original Contact] suggested I reach out to you. I'm a veteran transitioning to [field] and [Original Contact] thought you might have valuable insights..."

Always follow up with original contact: "Thanks again for the connection to [New Name]—we had a great conversation."

## Turning Informational Interviews Into Opportunities

### Building Advocates

The goal isn't one conversation—it's creating allies who:
- Think of you when they hear of opportunities
- Refer you to others
- Advocate for you internally

### From Information to Opportunity

**Natural progression:**
1. Informational interview (learning)
2. Follow-up and relationship building
3. They hear of opportunity and think of you
4. Introduction or referral
5. Interview and offer

This often happens weeks or months later—patience required.

### Direct Paths

Sometimes, during or after the conversation:
- They mention an opening
- They offer to introduce you to hiring manager
- They offer to submit your resume

**If this happens:**
- Express genuine interest
- Thank them
- Follow through immediately

## Tracking Your Informational Interviews

### Spreadsheet Tracking

| Name | Company | Date | Key Insights | Referrals | Follow-up Done | Next Action |
|------|---------|------|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| J. Smith | Acme | 1/15 | Focus on PMP | K. Jones | Yes | Connect to K. Jones |
| M. White | XYZ | 1/18 | Company growing | None | Yes | Check-in Feb |

### CRM Tools (Optional)

- **Streak** (Gmail extension) - Free for personal use
- **HubSpot CRM** - Free tier available
- **Notion** - Flexible tracking

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Turning It Into a Job Interview

Keep it focused on learning. Don't ask "Are you hiring?" or "Can you get me a job?"

### Mistake 2: Not Preparing

Showing up without research wastes their time and your opportunity.

### Mistake 3: Talking Too Much

You're there to learn. Listen 70% of the time.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting to Follow Up

The thank you note and ongoing contact are essential.

### Mistake 5: Not Asking for Referrals

"Who else should I talk to?" should always be asked.

### Mistake 6: Treating It as One-Time

The real value is the ongoing relationship.
