# Email Etiquette for Veterans in Corporate America

## Bottom Line Up Front

Email is the primary communication channel in most civilian workplaces, and doing it wrong can hurt your reputation. Veterans often struggle with tone—military email is direct and brief, but corporate email requires more finesse. This guide covers email norms, common mistakes, when to email versus other channels, and templates for common situations. Master email etiquette and you'll communicate more effectively and build better professional relationships.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Email mistakes are costly:
- Emails are permanent records
- Tone is easily misread
- CC and BCC choices have political implications
- Response time signals engagement
- Poor email habits damage your reputation

Veterans face specific challenges:
- Military emails are extremely direct
- Civilian email requires more relationship-building
- Political navigation via email is unfamiliar
- Email volume and management is different

The good news:
- Email etiquette is learnable
- Templates help you get started
- Observation helps you calibrate
- Mistakes are recoverable

## Email Fundamentals

### Subject Lines

**Purpose:** Help recipients prioritize and find emails later

**Best practices:**
- Be specific: "Q4 Budget Review - Action Needed by Friday"
- Include action required: "DECISION NEEDED: Vendor Selection"
- Indicate urgency when appropriate: "URGENT: System Down"
- Keep it short: Under 50 characters ideal

**Military vs. Civilian:**
- Military: Highly structured, often formulaic
- Civilian: More flexible, but clarity still matters

**Good examples:**
- "Meeting Request: Project Kickoff - Thurs 2pm"
- "Quick Question: Report Format"
- "FYI: Customer Feedback Summary"
- "Action Required: Approve PTO Request"

**Bad examples:**
- "Question" (too vague)
- "Hey" (too casual, no information)
- "URGENT!!!" (overused, loses meaning)
- "Follow up" (follow up on what?)

### Opening Lines

**Purpose:** Set tone and establish context

**Civilian norms:**
- Some greeting is expected (unlike military)
- Tone varies by relationship and culture
- Going straight to business can seem abrupt

**Opening options by formality:**

**Formal:**
- "Dear [Name],"
- "Good morning/afternoon,"

**Professional (most common):**
- "Hi [Name],"
- "Hello [Name],"

**Casual (established relationships):**
- "[Name],"
- "Hi,"
- "Hey [Name]," (only if that's your culture)

**Context-setting openers:**
- "Thank you for your email regarding..."
- "Following up on our conversation..."
- "Hope you had a good weekend." (use sparingly)

**Military translation:**
- Military: Jump straight to the point
- Civilian: Brief greeting, then the point

### Body Content

**Structure:**
1. Purpose (why you're writing)
2. Context (background if needed)
3. Ask/Information (the main content)
4. Next steps (what happens now)

**Best practices:**
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Bold key information or action items
- Be concise but not curt

**Military vs. Civilian:**
- Military: Extremely brief, BLUF focused
- Civilian: Still concise, but more context and relationship-building

**Formatting tips:**
- Use white space (break up text)
- Highlight action items: **Action needed: Please review by EOD Thursday**
- Number steps if there's a sequence
- Use formatting sparingly (too much bold/color is distracting)

### Closing Lines

**Purpose:** End professionally, clarify next steps

**Common closings:**
- "Please let me know if you have any questions."
- "I look forward to your response."
- "Thank you for your time."
- "Let me know if you need anything else."

**Sign-offs by formality:**

**Formal:**
- "Best regards,"
- "Sincerely,"
- "Respectfully," (more common in military; less common civilian)

**Professional (most common):**
- "Best,"
- "Thanks,"
- "Thank you,"

**Casual:**
- "Cheers," (culture dependent)
- "-[Name]"
- "Thanks!"

### Signature Block

**Include:**
- Full name
- Title
- Company
- Phone number (optional)
- LinkedIn (optional)

**Don't include:**
- Inspirational quotes
- Too many credentials
- Personal information
- Giant logos

**Example:**
```
Sarah Johnson
Program Manager, Operations
Company Name
(555) 123-4567
```

## Tone Calibration

### The Directness Spectrum

**Too Direct (Military default):**
"The report has errors. Fix them and resubmit by tomorrow."

**Too Soft (Overcorrection):**
"Hi there! I hope you're doing well! I was just wondering if you maybe had a chance to possibly take another look at the report? There might be a few small things to adjust. No rush! Thanks so much!"

**Just Right:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed a few items in the report that need adjustment before we can submit. Could you please review pages 3-5 and resubmit by end of day tomorrow? Happy to discuss if you have questions."

### Softening Language

Military directness needs softening in civilian email:

| Military | Civilian |
|----------|----------|
| "This is wrong." | "I noticed something that might need adjustment." |
| "You need to..." | "Could you please..." |
| "Do this immediately." | "When you have a moment..." or "By [specific deadline]..." |
| "That won't work." | "I'm wondering if we might consider an alternative approach." |
| "Fix this." | "Would you be able to revise this?" |

### Reading Tone in Others' Emails

**Signs of frustration:**
- Very short responses
- Formal language that was previously casual
- No pleasantries
- CC'ing additional people
- "As I mentioned before..."

**Signs of approval:**
- Prompt response
- Enthusiastic language
- "Great work!"
- Expanding on your ideas

**Signs of political maneuvering:**
- Adding CCs strategically
- Very careful wording
- Creating paper trail
- "Just to clarify..."

## When to Email vs. Other Channels

### Email Is Best For

- Formal requests and approvals
- Documentation/paper trail
- Communicating with external parties
- Non-urgent information sharing
- Complex information that needs to be referenced
- Requests that need a written response

### Instant Message/Slack Is Best For

- Quick questions
- Casual coordination
- Time-sensitive but not urgent matters
- Team chatter and rapport building
- "Are you free to chat?"

### Phone/Video Is Best For

- Sensitive or emotional topics
- Complex discussions
- When you've exchanged 3+ emails without resolution
- Relationship building
- Anything that could be misinterpreted

### In-Person Is Best For

- Performance feedback
- Conflict resolution
- Important relationship conversations
- Celebrating success
- Anything where body language matters

## CC and BCC Strategy

### CC Best Practices

**Why CC someone:**
- They need to be informed
- You want them to see the exchange
- They're a stakeholder in the topic
- Protocol requires their awareness

**Why NOT to CC:**
- To embarrass or pressure someone
- To CYA excessively
- When it's not their business
- When it adds to email overload

### BCC Best Practices

**Appropriate uses:**
- Large distribution lists (to protect email addresses)
- Removing someone from a thread gracefully
- Occasionally, to keep someone privately informed

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Setting someone up
- Political maneuvering
- Anything that would embarrass you if discovered

### Managing CC Politics

**If you're CC'd:**
- You're usually just being kept informed
- Reply all only if you have valuable input
- Don't feel obligated to respond

**When someone CC's your boss:**
- Stay calm—it may not be hostile
- Respond professionally
- Address the issue directly
- Don't escalate unnecessarily

## Response Time Expectations

### General Guidelines

|---------|---------------|
| Urgent (marked urgent) | Same day, within hours |

| FYI/informational | May not need response |
| Low priority | Within a week |

If you need immediate assistance, please contact [name] at [email/phone].

I'll respond to your email upon my return.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

### Being Too Brief

**Military style:** "See attached. Complete by Friday."
**Problem:** Comes across as curt, demanding, impersonal
**Better:** "Hi [Name], I've attached the form for your review. Could you please complete it by Friday? Let me know if you have any questions."

### Overusing "Respectfully"

**Military style:** Ending every email with "Respectfully" or "V/R"
**Problem:** Sounds overly formal in most civilian contexts
**Better:** "Best," "Thanks," or "Thank you"

### No Greeting

**Military style:** Jumping straight to content
**Problem:** Seems abrupt in civilian culture
**Better:** Always include a brief greeting ("Hi [Name],")

### All Caps for Emphasis

**Military style:** Using caps for emphasis
**Problem:** COMES ACROSS AS YELLING
**Better:** Use bold for emphasis, sparingly

### CC'ing Everyone

**Military style:** Wide distribution to cover all bases
**Problem:** Contributes to email overload, seems political
**Better:** CC only those who need to know

### Not Enough Context

**Military style:** Assuming everyone knows the background
**Problem:** Civilians may need more context
**Better:** Include brief context so email stands alone
