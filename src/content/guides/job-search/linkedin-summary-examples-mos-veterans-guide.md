# LinkedIn Summary Examples for Veterans (By MOS)

## Bottom Line Up Front

Your LinkedIn summary (About section) is your 2,600-character elevator pitch. A blank or military-jargon-filled summary gets ignored. This guide provides ready-to-customize summary templates organized by MOS category, target industry, and career level. Find your background, customize the template, and immediately improve your profile.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The About section is where recruiters decide if you're worth contacting. Research shows:
- Profiles with complete summaries get 40% more connection requests
- Recruiters spend 30% of their profile review time on the About section
- Keywords in your summary affect search rankings

Most veteran summaries fail because they:
- Are left completely blank
- Copy/paste military bios
- Use jargon civilians don't understand
- Don't state what role they want

## Summary Structure Template

Every effective veteran summary follows this structure:

```
PARAGRAPH 1: THE HOOK (2-3 sentences)
What you do + value you bring + current goal

PARAGRAPH 2: YOUR BACKGROUND (3-4 sentences)
Military experience translated + key accomplishments + unique qualifications

PARAGRAPH 3: WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING (2-3 sentences)
Target role + industry preferences + location/flexibility

PARAGRAPH 4: CALL TO ACTION (1-2 sentences)
How to contact you + what you're open to discussing
```

4. **No call to action** - Tell people how to reach you and what you want to discuss.

5. **Too much jargon** - Every acronym should be spelled out or removed.

6. **No target stated** - Saying "open to opportunities" is too vague.
