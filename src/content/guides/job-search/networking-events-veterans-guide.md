# Networking Events for Veterans: What to Attend

## Bottom Line Up Front

Not all networking events are worth your time. This guide identifies the highest-value events for transitioning veterans, explains what to expect at each type, and provides strategies to maximize your return on time invested. Focus on quality events where you can make meaningful connections, not quantity of events attended.

In-person networking advantages:
- Face-to-face connections are stronger
- Employers meet you, not just your resume
- Real-time assessment of fit (both ways)

Veterans should prioritize events because:
- 85% of jobs are filled through networking
- Military-focused events have committed employers
- Fellow veterans want to help each other
- Your presence demonstrates initiative

Quality conversations matter more than quantity.
