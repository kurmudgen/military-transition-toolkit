# How to Negotiate Salary as a Veteran (With Scripts)

## Bottom Line Up Front

Veterans consistently leave money on the table by not negotiating. Military pay is fixed—you had no experience negotiating—but civilian compensation is almost always negotiable. This guide provides a complete framework for salary negotiation, including word-for-word scripts for every scenario. You'll learn how to research fair compensation, when and how to negotiate, what to say in difficult situations, and how to secure the best offer possible. One successful negotiation can mean tens of thousands of dollars over your career.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Veterans face unique challenges in salary negotiation:
- **No experience:** Military pay is set; you never negotiated
- **Discomfort with self-promotion:** Asking for more feels wrong
- **Fear of losing the offer:** You assume negotiation is risky
- **Lack of market knowledge:** You don't know what you're worth
- **Gratitude trap:** "I should be grateful for any offer"

The truth:
- Employers expect you to negotiate
- Most initial offers have room to move
- Not negotiating can cost $5,000-$15,000+ initially
- That compounds over your career to six figures or more

## Understanding Your Worth

### Calculate Your Target Salary

Start by determining what you should make:

**Step 1: Research market rates**

Use multiple sources:
- **Glassdoor** - Search specific job titles and companies
- **LinkedIn Salary** - Free with Premium (free for veterans)
- **Salary.com** - Detailed compensation data
- **PayScale** - Salary by experience and skills
- **Levels.fyi** - Tech industry specific
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics** - National averages

**Step 2: Factor in your qualifications**

Adjust market rate based on:
- Years of relevant experience
- Specialized skills or certifications
- Security clearance (can add $10K-$30K+ in relevant industries)
- Advanced education
- Unique expertise

**Step 3: Consider total compensation**

Base salary is just one component:
- Bonus potential
- Equity/stock
- Benefits value (health, retirement, etc.)
- PTO/vacation
- Signing bonus
- Relocation assistance

**Step 4: Set your range**

- **Walk-away number:** Minimum you'll accept
- **Target:** What you're aiming for
- **Stretch:** Best-case scenario

### Translating Military Compensation

Your military pay wasn't just base pay:
- Basic Pay
- BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing)
- BAS (Basic Allowance for Subsistence)
- Special pays
- Tax advantages (some allowances tax-free)

**Calculate your total military compensation** to understand your starting point. A rough rule: your civilian salary should roughly match your total military compensation to maintain lifestyle—but many veterans can earn significantly more.

## When to Discuss Salary

### Early in the Process

If asked about salary expectations early:

**Script 1: Deflect politely**
"I'm focused on finding the right fit first. I'm confident we can find a number that works for both of us once I better understand the full scope of the role."

**Script 2: Give a researched range**
"Based on my research for similar roles in this market, I'm targeting the $X to $Y range. But I'm flexible depending on the total compensation package and the specific responsibilities."

**Script 3: Ask for their range**
"I'd like to learn more about the role before discussing specific numbers. Could you share the budgeted range for this position?"

### After Receiving an Offer

This is when real negotiation happens. You have maximum leverage once they've decided they want you.

## The Negotiation Process

### Step 1: Get the Offer in Writing

Always get the full offer documented before negotiating:
- Base salary
- Bonus structure
- Equity (if applicable)
- Benefits details
- Start date
- Any other terms

**Script:**
"Thank you so much for this offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity. Could you send me the full details in writing so I can review everything carefully?"

### Step 2: Express Enthusiasm, Buy Time

Never accept or negotiate immediately. Take time to evaluate.

**Script:**
"Thank you for this offer. I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to join [Company]. I'd like to take a day or two to review everything carefully. When do you need my response?"

### Step 3: Evaluate the Offer

Review the complete package:
- Base salary vs. market rate
- Bonus potential and likelihood
- Equity value (if applicable)
- Benefits (health, 401k match, etc.)
- PTO and flexibility
- Growth opportunity

### Step 4: Prepare Your Counter

Based on your research, prepare:
- Your counter number (typically 10-20% above offer)
- Justification for the increase
- Alternative asks if salary is fixed

### Step 5: Make the Counter

**Script for salary counter:**
"Thank you again for this offer. I'm very excited about joining [Company] and contributing to [specific goal]. I've done research on comparable roles in this market, and given my [specific qualifications/experience], I was hoping we could get closer to $[target]. Is there flexibility on the base salary?"

### Step 6: Handle Their Response

They'll respond in one of three ways:

**If they accept:** Great! Get it in writing.

**If they meet in the middle:** Consider if it's acceptable. You can accept or try one more time.

**If they say no:** Explore other areas of the package.

## Word-for-Word Scripts

### The Initial Counter

**Script:**
"I'm very enthusiastic about this role and [Company]. Based on my research and my experience in [relevant area], I was hoping the base salary could be closer to $[target]. My [specific experience/certification/clearance] brings immediate value, and I'm confident I can make a strong impact. Is there room to get closer to that number?"

### Countering a Counter-Offer

**Script:**
"I appreciate you coming up to $[their counter]. Given my [specific value point] and the market data I've seen for similar roles, I'd really like to land at $[your number]. Would $[compromise slightly above their counter] work?"

### When Salary Is Firm

**Script:**
"I understand the base salary is set at $[offer]. Are there other components of the package we could discuss? I'm thinking about [signing bonus/additional PTO/early review for raise/equity/relocation/professional development budget]."

### Negotiating Non-Salary Items

**Signing bonus:**
"Since there's limited flexibility on base salary, would a signing bonus be possible? Given the transition I'm making [from military/from another city], a one-time bonus of $[amount] would help me join the team in a strong position."

**Additional PTO:**
"The base salary works for me, but the PTO is less than I currently have. Would it be possible to start with [X] weeks instead of [Y] weeks?"

**Early performance review:**
"I understand the salary bands. Would you be open to a performance review at 6 months instead of 12, with the possibility of an increase based on performance?"

**Remote work/flexibility:**
"I'm very interested in the role. Is there flexibility on the hybrid schedule? The ability to work remotely [X] days per week would make a significant difference for me."

### Responding to Pressure

**If they say "This is our best offer":**
"I appreciate you sharing that. Can I ask if there are any other components of the package that might have flexibility—like signing bonus, start date, or professional development budget?"

**If they need an answer immediately:**
"I'm very interested and want to make sure I give this the consideration it deserves. Would 24 hours be possible to ensure I'm making this commitment with full confidence?"

**If they seem frustrated:**
"I want to be clear that I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity. I'm asking these questions because I want to make sure we start this relationship on strong footing. I appreciate you working with me on this."

### Accepting the Offer

**Script:**
"Thank you for working with me on this. I'm excited to accept the offer at $[final number]. I'm looking forward to joining the team and making an impact. Could you send me the updated offer letter to sign?"

### Declining Gracefully

**Script:**
"Thank you so much for this opportunity and for working with me through the process. After careful consideration, I've decided to pursue another direction that's a better fit for my current situation. I really appreciate your time and the offer. I hope we can stay connected for potential opportunities in the future."

## Special Considerations for Veterans

### Security Clearance Premium

If you have an active clearance:
- This has significant value in defense, government contracting, and some tech roles
- Research the premium in your target industry
- Don't undersell this asset

**Script:**
"I have an active [TS/SCI/Secret] clearance, which I know has value given the time and cost to obtain one. I'd like the salary to reflect that asset."

### Military Experience Translation

Help them understand your value:

**Script:**
"My military experience includes [X years] of leadership, managing teams of [Y] people and budgets of $[Z]. While it's a different environment, the skills translate directly to [relevant job functions]."

### Competing Offers

If you have multiple offers:

**Script:**
"I want to be transparent with you—I have another offer I'm considering. [Company] is my preferred choice, but the other offer is at $[X]. Is there flexibility to match or get close to that number?"

### When You Have No Other Offers

You can still negotiate:
- Focus on market data
- Emphasize your value
- Be confident but not aggressive

**Script:**
"Based on my research, the market rate for this role with my qualifications is $[X to Y]. I'm asking because I want to start at a level that reflects my value and will allow me to fully commit to this opportunity."

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

1. **Not negotiating at all** - The biggest mistake. Almost every offer is negotiable.

2. **Accepting immediately** - Always take time to evaluate, even if you love the offer.

3. **Anchoring too low** - Don't give a number below market rate.

4. **Focusing only on salary** - Total compensation matters; negotiate the whole package.

5. **Being apologetic** - You're not asking for a favor; you're having a business discussion.

6. **Lying about competing offers** - Don't fabricate offers; it can backfire.

7. **Negotiating via email when call is better** - Important negotiations are better voice-to-voice.

8. **Not getting it in writing** - Always get the final offer documented.

9. **Thinking negotiation will cost you the offer** - Employers expect it; professional negotiation won't rescind an offer.

10. **Underselling security clearance** - This is a valuable asset in relevant industries.

## Psychology of Negotiation

### Mindset Shifts for Veterans

**Old thinking:** "I should be grateful for any offer."
**New thinking:** "I deserve fair compensation for my value."

**Old thinking:** "Negotiating is greedy."
**New thinking:** "Negotiating is a professional business discussion."

**Old thinking:** "They might take back the offer."
**New thinking:** "Professional negotiation is expected."

**Old thinking:** "I don't deserve more than what they offered."
**New thinking:** "The offer is a starting point, not a final answer."

### The Employer's Perspective

Remember:
- They want you (that's why they made an offer)
- They have budget flexibility (usually)
- They expect you to negotiate
- They'd rather increase salary than lose a good candidate
- Initial offers are rarely their best offers
