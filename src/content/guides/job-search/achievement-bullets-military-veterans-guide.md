# How to Write Achievement Bullets for Military Experience

## Bottom Line Up Front

Achievement bullets are the difference between a resume that gets interviews and one that gets ignored. Most veterans list duties when they should be showcasing results. This guide teaches you the exact formulas to transform military responsibilities into powerful achievement statements. You'll see before-and-after examples and get templates you can customize immediately.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The problem with most veteran resumes:

**Duty-focused bullet:**
"Responsible for maintaining vehicles and equipment."

**Achievement-focused bullet:**
"Maintained fleet of 24 vehicles worth $3.2M, achieving 98% readiness rate and reducing breakdown incidents by 40%."

The first says what you did. The second proves you did it well.

Hiring managers spend 7 seconds scanning your resume. Achievement bullets grab attention; duty lists don't.

## The Achievement Formula

### Basic Structure

**Action Verb + Task + Result**

Every bullet should answer: "So what? What difference did you make?"

### Advanced Structure

**Action Verb + What You Did + How You Did It + Measurable Result**

### The "CAR" Method

- **Challenge:** What problem or situation did you face?
- **Action:** What did you do about it?
- **Result:** What was the measurable outcome?

### The "PAR" Method

- **Problem:** What needed to be solved?
- **Action:** What steps did you take?
- **Result:** What did you achieve?

## Types of Achievements to Highlight

### Efficiency Improvements

Did you make something faster, cheaper, or easier?

**Examples:**
- "Reduced processing time from 5 days to 2 days by implementing..."
- "Cut supply costs by 25% through renegotiating vendor contracts..."

### Cost Savings

Did you save money or prevent waste?

### Performance Metrics

**Examples:**
- "Achieved 98% readiness rate against 90% standard..."
- "Exceeded production targets by 15% for 8 consecutive months..."
- "Scored 295/300 on physical fitness, top 5% of unit..."

### Leadership and Development

**Examples:**

### Innovation

Did you create or improve something?

### Recognition

**Examples:**

- "Awarded Meritorious Service Medal for exceptional performance..."
- "Chosen as Subject Matter Expert for division-wide initiative..."

## Quantifying Military Achievements

### What to Quantify

**People:**
- Team size managed
- Personnel trained
- Customers/clients served

**Money:**
- Budget managed
- Savings achieved
- Revenue generated

**Time:**
- Processing time improved
- Hours saved
- Response time reduced

**Scale:**
- Equipment value
- Geographic coverage
- Transactions processed

**Percentages:**
- Improvement rates
- Accuracy levels
- Efficiency gains

### Finding Numbers in Military Experience

**Ask yourself:**
- How many people were on my team?
- What was the value of equipment I managed?
- What was my operating budget?
- How many transactions/missions/projects did I handle?
- What were my performance scores?
- How much did I improve something?
- What was the "before" and "after"?

### Creating Percentages

If you don't have exact percentages, calculate them:

**Before:** 5-day processing time
**After:** 3-day processing time
**Calculation:** (5-3)/5 = 40% reduction

**Before:** 10 errors per month
**After:** 3 errors per month
**Calculation:** (10-3)/10 = 70% reduction

## Building Bullets from Your Experience

### Step 1: List Your Responsibilities

What were you supposed to do?
- Maintain vehicles
- Train soldiers
- Manage supply

### Step 2: Add Numbers

Quantify scope:
- Maintain 24 vehicles worth $3.2M
- Train 150 soldiers per year
- Manage $500K inventory

### Step 3: Identify Results

What happened because of your work?
- Maintain 24 vehicles worth $3.2M → 98% readiness rate
- Train 150 soldiers per year → 95% first-time pass rate
- Manage $500K inventory → Zero losses, 30% cost reduction

### Step 4: Add Context

Why did this matter?
- 98% readiness rate → 8% above standard
