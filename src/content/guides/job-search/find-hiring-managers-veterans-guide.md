# How to Find Hiring Managers and Skip HR

## Bottom Line Up Front

HR departments filter candidates. Hiring managers make decisions. When you connect directly with hiring managers, you bypass gatekeepers and get in front of decision-makers. This guide shows you how to find hiring managers for any role, how to reach out appropriately, and how to turn that contact into an interview opportunity.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The traditional application path:
1. Apply online
2. ATS filters your resume
3. HR reviews what's left
4. HR screens candidates
5. Hiring manager finally sees select few

The direct path:
1. Find hiring manager
2. Make connection
3. Demonstrate value
4. Get referred for interview

Studies show referred candidates are:
- 4x more likely to be hired
- Hired faster (29 days vs 45 days)
- Better performers once hired

For veterans, this is especially powerful because:
- Hiring managers often appreciate military background
- You can explain your experience directly
- You bypass ATS translation issues
- Personal connection builds rapport

## Who Is the Hiring Manager?

### Definition

The hiring manager is the person who:
- Has the open position on their team
- Makes the final hiring decision
- Will be your direct supervisor
- Defined the job requirements

### Not the Hiring Manager

**Recruiter/Talent Acquisition:**
- Handles sourcing and screening
- Doesn't make final decision
- Useful but not decision-maker

**HR Business Partner:**
- Supports hiring process
- Advises on compensation
- Doesn't manage the role

**Executive/VP:**
- May approve hire
- Usually not the day-to-day manager
- Sometimes involved for senior roles

## Strategy 1: LinkedIn Search

### Basic Search Method

**Search query:**
"[Department] Manager [Company Name]"
"[Job Function] Director [Company Name]"

**Examples:**
- "Operations Manager Acme Corporation"
- "Engineering Director XYZ Inc"
- "Marketing Manager ABC Company"

### Advanced Search Filters

1. Go to LinkedIn
2. Enter company name in search
3. Click "People"
4. Filter by:
   - Current company
   - Title keywords
   - Location

### Identifying the Right Person

**Likely hiring managers:**
- Same department as the role
- Manager/Director/VP in title
- Team size matches role level
- Been at company 6+ months

**Check their profile for:**
- Current team size
- Recent "We're hiring!" posts
- Department alignment
- Tenure (newer managers may not be hiring)

## Strategy 2: Job Posting Clues

### Information in Postings

Sometimes job postings reveal:
- Hiring manager name
- Team name
- Department structure
- Reporting relationship

**Look for phrases like:**
- "Report to the Director of..."
- "Join [Name]'s team"
- "Part of the [Team] organization"

### Using Posting Details

If the posting says "Reports to VP of Operations":
1. Search LinkedIn for "VP Operations [Company]"
2. Find the person
3. They're likely your target

## Strategy 3: Company Research

### Company Website

**Check:**
- Leadership/Team pages
- About Us sections
- Blog author bios
- Press releases (quotes from managers)

### LinkedIn Company Page

**Look at:**
- Company updates (who posts about hiring)
- Employee list (filter by department)
- "People Also Viewed" for relevant managers

### News and Press

**Search for:**
- "[Company] [department] manager interview"
- "[Company] hiring [job function]"
- Industry publication mentions

## Strategy 4: Network Inquiry

### Ask Your Network

If you know anyone at the company:

```
Hey [Name],

I'm applying for the [Job Title] position at [Company] and trying to learn more about the role. Do you happen to know who the hiring manager is for that position? I'd love to understand more about the team before applying.

Thanks!
[Your name]
```

### Ask Recruiters

If a recruiter contacts you:

```
Thanks for reaching out about this role. Before I apply, I'd like to learn more about the team. Can you share who the hiring manager is so I can research their background?
```

## Strategy 5: Direct Inquiry

### Contact Company HR

As a last resort:

```
Subject: Inquiry About [Job Title] Position - [Job ID]

Hello,

I'm interested in the [Job Title] position (Job ID: [#]) and would like to learn more about the team I'd be joining. Could you share who the hiring manager for this role is?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## Finding Email Addresses

### Common Email Formats

Most companies use one of these:
- firstname.lastname@company.com
- firstname@company.com
- flastname@company.com
- firstnamel@company.com

### Tools to Find Emails

**Free options:**
- Hunter.io (limited free searches)
- Clearbit Connect
- LinkedIn (sometimes visible)
- Company website "Contact" pages

**Method: Format testing**
1. Find company email format (from press releases, website, etc.)
2. Apply format to hiring manager name
3. Verify with email verification tool

### Email Verification

Before sending, verify email is valid:
- Hunter.io email verifier
- NeverBounce
- EmailListVerify

Sending to invalid emails hurts your deliverability.

## What Not to Do

### Don't Be Pushy

**Wrong:**
"I'm the best candidate for this role. When can we meet?"

**Right:**
"I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your team's needs."

### Don't Skip the Application

**Wrong:**
Only contacting hiring manager without applying

**Right:**
Apply through official channels AND reach out to hiring manager

### Don't Send Generic Messages

**Wrong:**
Copy-paste templates without personalization

**Right:**
Reference specific aspects of the role, company, or manager's background

### Don't Over-Contact

**Wrong:**
Multiple messages across platforms in one week

**Right:**
One initial outreach, one follow-up after 1 week, then move on

### Don't Badmouth HR

**Wrong:**
"I wanted to go directly to you since HR takes forever"

**Right:**
"I've applied through your careers site and wanted to introduce myself"

## Following Up

### If No Response After 1 Week

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my message about the [Job Title] role. I understand you're busy—just wanted to express my continued interest.

If this isn't the right time or role, I'd appreciate any guidance on next steps.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### If They Respond Positively

- Thank them promptly
- Suggest specific meeting times
- Be flexible
- Prepare talking points
- Send calendar invite if they agree

### If They Redirect to HR

**Response:**
"Thank you for the direction. I'll continue through the formal process. I appreciate you taking the time to respond, and I hope we can connect if I advance in the process."

This keeps the relationship positive for future opportunities.
