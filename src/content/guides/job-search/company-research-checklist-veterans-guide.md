# Company Research Before Applying: Veteran's Checklist

## Bottom Line Up Front

Applying without researching is like going on a mission without intel. Company research helps you customize applications, prepare for interviews, avoid bad employers, and find organizations that value veterans. This guide provides a comprehensive checklist for researching any company, with special focus on identifying military-friendly employers.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

Research matters because:
- Tailored applications get more interviews
- Research reveals if culture fits veterans
- You avoid wasting time on bad opportunities
- Interview prep becomes more effective
- You can ask intelligent questions
- Salary negotiations start from knowledge

Veterans face unique considerations:
- Some companies actively recruit veterans
- Others don't understand military experience
- Culture fit varies dramatically
- Some industries align better with military backgrounds
