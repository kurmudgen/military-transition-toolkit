# Resume Keywords That Get Past ATS Systems for Veterans

## Bottom Line Up Front

Before a human sees your resume, an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) scans it for keywords. If your resume doesn't match, it's filtered out—regardless of your qualifications. Veterans face extra challenges because military terminology doesn't match civilian keywords. This guide teaches you exactly how ATS systems work, where to find the right keywords, and how to optimize your resume to pass automated screening.

## Why This Matters for Veterans

The ATS challenge:
- 98% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS
- 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS before human review
- Average job posting receives 250 applications
- ATS filters based on keyword matching

Veterans face unique problems:
- Military job titles don't match civilian searches
- Military jargon isn't in ATS keyword libraries
- Skills are described differently than civilian equivalents
- Ranks and unit designations confuse the system

Translation + keyword optimization = interview opportunities.

## How ATS Systems Work

### Basic Functionality

1. **Parsing:** ATS reads your resume, extracting text into fields
2. **Keyword matching:** System compares your content against job requirements
3. **Scoring:** Resume receives a score based on match percentage
4. **Ranking:** Candidates are ranked for recruiter review
5. **Filtering:** Low-scoring resumes may never be seen by humans

### What ATS Looks For

**Hard matches:**
- Job title
- Required skills
- Certifications
- Education
- Years of experience

**Soft matches:**
- Related keywords
- Industry terms
- Tool and system names
- Synonyms and variations

### Common ATS Systems

- **Taleo** (Oracle) - Large enterprises
- **Workday** - Growing companies
- **iCIMS** - Mid-market
- **Greenhouse** - Tech companies
- **Lever** - Startups and tech
- **BrassRing** - Large corporations
- **SuccessFactors** (SAP) - Global companies

## Finding Keywords in Job Postings

### Step 1: Identify Required Skills

Look for explicit requirements:

**"Requirements" or "Must Have":**
```
• 5+ years of project management experience
• PMP certification required
• Experience with Agile methodologies
• Strong stakeholder management skills
• Budget management experience
```

**Keywords to extract:**
- Project management
- PMP
- Agile
- Stakeholder management
- Budget management

### Step 2: Note Preferred Skills

Look for "nice to have" qualifications:

**"Preferred" or "Nice to Have":**
```
• Six Sigma certification preferred
• Experience in defense industry
• Knowledge of SAP systems
• Security clearance a plus
```

**Keywords to extract:**
- Six Sigma
- Defense industry
- SAP
- Security clearance

### Step 3: Analyze Job Description

Pull keywords from the full description:

**Example text:**
"The Operations Manager will oversee daily operations, lead cross-functional teams, implement process improvements, and manage vendor relationships..."

**Keywords to extract:**
- Operations Manager
- Daily operations
- Cross-functional teams
- Process improvements
- Vendor relationships

### Step 4: Research Similar Postings

Compare 3-5 similar job postings:
- What terms appear consistently?
- What skills are mentioned repeatedly?
- What tools/systems are standard?

These recurring terms are high-value keywords.

### Section Headers

## Keyword Placement Strategy

### Where to Place Keywords

**High-value locations:**
1. **Job titles** - Match the title you're applying for
2. **Summary section** - Pack with relevant keywords
3. **Skills section** - List all matching skills
4. **Experience bullets** - Use naturally in achievements

### Keyword Density

**Guidelines:**
- Use important keywords 3-5 times throughout resume
- Vary placement (don't cluster)
- Use naturally (not stuffing)
- Include in different forms (manage, management, manager)

### Example Keyword Integration

**Job posting keywords:**
- Project management
- Stakeholder management
- Budget management
- Agile methodology
- Cross-functional teams
