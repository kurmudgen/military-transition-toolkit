**Subject:** How AdaptHome works (and why I built it)

---

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for being open to learning more. Let me walk you through exactly how AdaptHome works and what our beta program looks like.

**The Platform:**

Veterans come to us, enter their ZIP code, disability type, and needed modifications. Our calculator gives them instant cost estimates based on their grant type (SAH/SHA/HISA).

If they're in Southern California and you're in their area, we match them directly with you. One lead, one contractor. The veteran gets your contact info, you get theirs. From there, it's your relationship to manage.

**Beta Program (First 25 Contractors):**

- **Cost:** Free leads during beta (normally $400-500 per lead post-beta)
- **Geographic focus:** San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino counties
- **Lead quality:** Veterans with approved grants, not window shoppers
- **Exclusivity:** We don't send the same lead to multiple contractors
- **Your commitment:** Just list your profile and respond when leads come in

**Time Investment:**

Setup takes about 10 minutes (company info, service areas, certifications). After that, you'll get email notifications when a qualified veteran in your area needs work. No monthly fees, no platform management, no BS.

**Why This Works:**

I'm building this because I've seen too many veterans get screwed by contractors who don't understand VA requirements, or they waste weeks trying to find someone qualified. And I've talked to contractors frustrated by HomeAdvisor-style lead mills where they're competing with 5 other people for the same job.

This is better for everyone.

**Next Steps:**

If this sounds like something you'd want to be part of, I can get you set up in the beta this week. We're limiting it to 25 contractors to make sure we're delivering quality leads, not volume.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Respectfully,

**P.S.** I'm also building a suite of veteran-focused tools (Transition Toolkit, SpouseForce). This is all about serving those who served—with authenticity, not corporate fluff.
