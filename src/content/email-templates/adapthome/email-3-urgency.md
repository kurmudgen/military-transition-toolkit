**Subject:** [First Name]—12 beta spots left for SoCal contractors

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick update: We're down to 12 remaining spots in our beta program for Southern California contractors.

I wanted to reach back out because I think AdaptHome could be a solid lead source for your business, and I don't want you to miss the window for free beta access.

**What's happening right now:**

- 13 CAPS-certified contractors already signed up in San Diego and Orange County
- We're launching veteran outreach next week (targeting 20 qualified leads in the first 30 days)
- Beta contractors get free leads through Q1 2026—after that, we move to paid ($400-500 per lead or $299/month subscription)

**Why the 25-contractor limit?**

I want to prove the model works before scaling. That means focusing on quality leads in a defined geographic area, not spreading thin across the whole state. If we can't deliver real value in SoCal first, we have no business expanding.

**Your move:**

If you want in, here's the signup link: [adapthome.vet/contractor-signup]

Takes less than 10 minutes. If you're on the fence, I'm happy to answer any questions—just hit reply.

But if this isn't for you, no worries. I'll stop reaching out and wish you fair winds.

**P.S.** After we fill the 25 beta spots, the next contractors will go on a waitlist and pay from day one. I'm not saying that to be pushy—just being straight with you about where we're at.
