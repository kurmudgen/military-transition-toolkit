**Subject:** Quick question about VA adaptive housing projects

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're CAPS-certified and work with adaptive housing modifications. I'm Jacob, a 19-year Navy veteran currently on active duty, and I wanted to reach out about something I've been building.

I'm launching AdaptHome, a platform that connects California veterans with qualified contractors like you for VA-funded adaptive housing modifications.

**Here's the problem:** Veterans with approved SAH, SHA, or HISA grants struggle to find experienced contractors who understand VA requirements. They end up on HomeAdvisor getting bombarded by 5+ contractors fighting for the same lead, or worse—hiring someone with no VA experience who messes up their paperwork.

**Our solution:** We pre-qualify veterans (grant already approved, budget confirmed), then match them with CAPS-certified contractors in their area. One veteran, one contractor. No bidding wars, no tire-kickers.

Would you be open to a quick conversation about how this could work for your business? I'm keeping it very low-pressure—just want to see if it's a fit.

Fair winds,
