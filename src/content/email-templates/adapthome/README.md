# AdaptHome Contractor Outreach Email Sequence

## Overview

This is a 3-email cold outreach sequence designed to recruit CAPS-certified contractors for the AdaptHome beta program. The sequence follows a proven pattern: introduce → educate → close.

## Target Audience

- **CAPS-certified contractors** (Certified Aging-in-Place Specialists)
- **VA-experienced contractors** who have worked with adaptive housing grants
- **Geographic focus:** Southern California (San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino counties)
- **Business size:** Small to mid-size contractors (not large national chains)

## Email Sequence Strategy

### Email 1: Connection Request Follow-Up
- **Purpose:** Introduce AdaptHome and establish credibility
- **Tone:** Casual, veteran-to-veteran, problem-focused
- **Key elements:**
  - Brief personal intro (Navy veteran, active duty)
  - Problem statement (veterans can't find qualified contractors)
  - Solution overview (pre-qualified leads, no bidding wars)
  - Soft ask (open to conversation?)
- **CTA:** Low-pressure conversation invitation

### Email 2: Value Proposition
- **Purpose:** Educate on platform mechanics and beta program details
- **Tone:** Professional but authentic, transparent
- **Key elements:**
  - How the platform works (calculator → matching)
  - Beta program specifics (free leads, 25 contractors, SoCal only)
  - Time commitment (10 minutes setup, email notifications)
  - Why it's different (exclusive leads, no HomeAdvisor BS)
- **CTA:** Invitation to join beta with question prompt

### Email 3: Urgency & Call to Action
- **Purpose:** Create urgency and drive decision
- **Tone:** Direct, honest, not manipulative
- **Key elements:**
  - Scarcity (12 spots left)
  - Social proof (13 already signed up)
  - Timeline (launching veteran outreach next week)
  - Transparency (beta = free, then paid model)
- **CTA:** Direct signup link with opt-out option

## Timing Recommendations

**Option 1: Aggressive (3-day sequence)**
- Day 1: Email 1
- Day 3: Email 2 (if no response)
- Day 6: Email 3 (if no response)

**Option 2: Standard (7-day sequence)**
- Day 1: Email 1
- Day 4: Email 2 (if no response)
- Day 7: Email 3 (if no response)

**Option 3: Relaxed (10-day sequence)**
- Day 1: Email 1
- Day 5: Email 2 (if no response)
- Day 10: Email 3 (if no response)

**Best practice:** Use the 7-day sequence for most contractors. Use 3-day for high-priority targets (well-known CAPS contractors with strong VA experience). Use 10-day if you're worried about seeming too pushy.

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending, customize each email:

- [ ] Replace `[First Name]` with contractor's actual first name
- [ ] Update subject lines to match your brand voice
- [ ] Adjust the "13 contractors signed up" number in Email 3 to reflect actual signups
- [ ] Update "12 spots left" to reflect actual remaining beta slots
- [ ] Replace `[adapthome.vet/contractor-signup]` with actual signup URL
- [ ] Consider adding service-specific sign-offs (Semper Fi for Marines, Hooyah for Navy, etc.)
- [ ] Adjust geographic references if expanding beyond SoCal

## Response Handling

**If they respond positively to Email 1:**
- Skip Email 2 and 3
- Reply within 24 hours
- Send them the signup link directly
- Offer a brief onboarding call (10-15 min)

**If they respond with questions to Email 1 or 2:**
- Answer their questions directly
- Don't be pushy
- Reiterate beta benefits (free leads, exclusive)
- Ask if they want to hop on a quick call

**If they respond to Email 3:**
- Fast-track them to signup
- Thank them for their interest
- Set expectations for next steps (profile setup, first lead timeline)

**If no response after Email 3:**
- Move to "warm lead" list
- Follow up in 30 days with a progress update (e.g., "We're now at X veterans served, Y contractors onboarded")

## A/B Testing Ideas

Test these variations to optimize conversion:

**Subject lines:**
- Veteran-to-veteran angle vs. business value angle
- Question format vs. statement format
- Use of numbers ("12 spots left") vs. general urgency

**Email content:**
- Length (these emails are ~200-300 words; test shorter 100-word versions)
- Personal story emphasis (Jacob's Navy background) vs. pure business value
- Social proof placement (early vs. late in email)

**CTA:**
- Direct signup link vs. "reply to learn more"
- Single CTA vs. multiple options (signup, call, reply)

## Legal & Compliance

- ✅ CAN-SPAM compliant (sender identity, opt-out option in Email 3)
- ✅ Truthful claims (no exaggeration of lead volume or contractor earnings)
- ✅ Privacy-conscious (no sharing of veteran data without consent)

**Note:** Always include an unsubscribe link in production emails. These templates use "hit reply to opt out" as a simple solution for small-scale outreach.

## Metrics to Track

- **Open rate** (aim for 40-50% for cold emails)
- **Reply rate** (aim for 10-15%)
- **Conversion rate** (replies → signups, aim for 50%+)
- **Time to response** (track which email gets the most replies)
- **Objections** (track common concerns to refine messaging)

## Next Steps After This Sequence

If you want to build on this foundation:

1. **Nurture sequence:** For contractors who showed interest but didn't sign up
2. **Onboarding sequence:** For contractors who signed up (welcome, profile setup, first lead expectations)
3. **Retention sequence:** For contractors who haven't received a lead in 30+ days
4. **Upsell sequence:** When transitioning from free beta to paid model
