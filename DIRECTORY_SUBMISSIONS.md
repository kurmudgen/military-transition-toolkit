**Long Description (500-1000 words):**

Military Transition Toolkit is a comprehensive web application designed to help service members successfully navigate the complex transition from military to civilian life. Built by veterans who have personally experienced the challenges of transition, MTT provides a centralized platform that combines planning tools, financial calculators, VA benefits guidance, and career resources.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Each year, approximately 200,000 service members separate from military service. The transition process is notoriously complex, with critical deadlines scattered across multiple agencies, confusing benefits programs, and high-stakes decisions about healthcare, location, and career paths. Veterans frequently miss deadlines, leave thousands in unclaimed VA benefits on the table, and feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of conflicting information.

**Our Solution:**
Military Transition Toolkit provides a single, organized platform that guides service members through every aspect of transition:

**VA Claims Builder** - Our signature feature helps veterans identify medical conditions, track required evidence, generate personal statements, and estimate the financial impact of their claims. The builder organizes conditions by body system and provides templates for buddy statements and medical documentation.

**Personalized Checklists** - Based on individual circumstances (20+ year retirement, medical board/IDES separation, or early separation), MTT provides customized task lists covering the entire 24-month pre-separation timeline. Users track progress and receive reminders for critical deadlines.

**Financial Planning Tools:**
- Military retirement pay calculators (both High-3 and BRS systems)
- State benefits comparison across all 50 states
- VA disability compensation estimators
- Terminal leave calculator
- Side-by-side scenario planning for relocation decisions

**Career Transition Support:**
- Resume builder with military-to-civilian translation
- Job search tracker with saved positions
- Application and interview tracking
- Offer comparison tools

**Timeline & Appointment Management:**
- Centralized appointment tracking
- Medical appointment reminders
- PEBLO and TAP meeting scheduling
- MedBoard process phase tracking

**Resource Library:**
- 60+ curated resources for VA benefits, healthcare, education, and employment
- Partnership with training providers, financial services, and education platforms
- Blog with transition guides and state-specific benefits information

**Who We Serve:**
- Active duty service members within 24 months of separation/retirement
- Veterans navigating medical board (IDES/MEB) processes
- Service members separating before 20 years (ETS)
- Recently separated veterans optimizing their VA claims

**Our Mission:**
We are committed to keeping MTT free forever through partnership revenue rather than user fees. Core transition features remain accessible to all service members regardless of financial circumstances. Our business model relies on partnerships with veteran-serving organizations (training providers, financial advisors, education platforms) rather than charging veterans during their most vulnerable transition period.

**Technology:**
Built with modern web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase), MTT offers cloud sync for data backup while respecting user privacy with local-first storage. The platform works on desktop and mobile devices and includes PDF export capabilities for offline access to transition plans.

**Impact:**
By providing organized, actionable guidance during the critical transition period, MTT helps service members:
- Maximize their VA disability compensation
- Meet critical deadlines and avoid missing benefits
- Make informed decisions about relocation and career paths
- Successfully translate military experience to civilian opportunities
- Navigate complex medical separation processes with confidence

Military Transition Toolkit represents what's possible when veterans build solutions for veterans - practical, comprehensive, and genuinely focused on the success of those who served.

Product Name: Military Transition Toolkit

Website: https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com

Tagline: Complete military transition platform - VA claims, career planning, financial tools. Built by veterans.

Category: Productivity, Career, SaaS, Social Impact

Description:
Military Transition Toolkit is a comprehensive platform designed to help the 200,000+ service members who transition from military to civilian life each year. Built by veterans who personally experienced the overwhelming complexity of transition, MTT provides a centralized solution for managing every aspect of this critical life change.

The platform's signature VA Claims Builder helps veterans identify medical conditions, track required evidence, generate personal statements, and estimate disability compensation. This systematic approach ensures veterans don't leave benefits on the table - a common problem when navigating the complex VA system alone.

Financial planning tools include military retirement pay calculators supporting both High-3 and BRS systems, comprehensive state benefits comparison covering all 50 states side-by-side, terminal leave calculators, and VA disability estimators. These tools help service members make informed decisions about where to relocate and how to plan post-military finances.

Personalized transition checklists adapt to individual circumstances (20+ year retirement, medical board/IDES separation, or ETS before 20 years), providing a structured 24-month timeline with task tracking and progress monitoring. Career transition features include a resume builder with military-to-civilian translation, job search tracker, and interview management.

What makes MTT unique is the commitment to keeping it completely free forever. While many services charge veterans during their most vulnerable transition period, MTT sustains through partnerships with veteran-serving organizations (training providers, financial advisors, education platforms) rather than user fees.

The platform serves active duty members within 24 months of separation, veterans navigating medical separations, and recently separated veterans optimizing their VA claims. With cloud sync, mobile responsiveness, and PDF export capabilities, MTT provides the structure and guidance needed for successful transition.

Tagline: Helping service members successfully transition to civilian life

Description:
Military Transition Toolkit is a comprehensive platform serving 200,000+ annual transitioning service members. Features include VA claims builder with evidence tracking, personalized 24-month transition checklists, military retirement calculators (High-3 & BRS), state benefits comparison across all 50 states, resume builder with military-to-civilian translation, and job tracking tools.

Built by veterans who experienced the overwhelming complexity of military transition firsthand, MTT centralizes scattered resources into one organized platform. Veterans can maximize VA benefits, meet critical deadlines, plan finances, and successfully transition to civilian careers - all completely free.

Our mission-driven approach keeps MTT free forever through partnerships with veteran-serving organizations rather than charging users during their most vulnerable transition period.
