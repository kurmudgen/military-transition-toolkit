# MVP Testing Report - Military Transition Toolkit

## Testing Environment

- **Dev Server**: Running on `http://localhost:5177`
- **Status**: ✅ Compiling successfully
- **Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Commit**: Latest (Upgrade prompts integrated)

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 4: Stripe Payment Integration
- Stripe client configuration (`src/lib/stripe.js`)
- Pricing page (`/pricing`) with 3 tiers
- Account management page (`/app/account`)
- Checkout flow API endpoints (`api/stripe/`)
- Webhook handlers for subscription lifecycle
- Subscription service layer

### ✅ Phase 5: Feature Gating System
- Feature gating utilities (`src/utils/featureGating.js`)
- Custom hooks (`useFeatureAccess`, `useUsageLimits`)
- UpgradePrompt component (3 variants: banner, modal, inline)
- PremiumBadge component
- FeatureLockOverlay component

### ✅ Component Integration (Partial)
- **Resume Builder**:
  - ✅ 1 resume limit check
  - ✅ PDF export blocking
  - ✅ Upgrade prompts
  - ✅ Premium badges
- **Job Search**:
  - ✅ 5 saved jobs limit check
  - ✅ Upgrade prompts

## Critical Limitation: Stripe Not Configured ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: The payment system and feature gating cannot be fully tested because Stripe is not configured. This means:

- ❌ No Stripe API keys in `.env`
- ❌ No Stripe products created
- ❌ No price IDs configured
- ❌ No webhook secret
- ❌ All users appear as "free tier" (no one is premium)

## What CAN Be Tested (Without Stripe)

### 1. App Compilation & Navigation ✅

**Test**: Navigate through the app
- Open `http://localhost:5177`
- Navigate to different pages
- Check for console errors

**Expected**: App loads without errors, all pages accessible

---

### 2. Authentication Pages ✅

**Test**: View auth pages
```
1. Go to /login
2. Go to /signup
3. Go to /forgot-password
```

**Expected**:
- All auth pages display correctly
- Dark mode works
- Forms are styled properly

**Note**: Cannot test actual auth because Supabase credentials aren't in .env

---

### 3. Pricing Page ✅

**Test**: View pricing tiers
```
1. Go to /pricing
2. Check all 3 tiers display (Free, Monthly, Annual)
3. Check feature lists
4. Click "Upgrade Now" buttons
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ All 3 pricing tiers visible
- ✅ Features listed correctly
- ❌ "Upgrade Now" will fail (no Stripe keys)

---

### 4. Account Page ⚠️

**Test**: View account settings
```
1. Go to /app/account (requires auth)
2. Check subscription display
3. Check usage limits
```

**Expected**:
- ⚠️ Won't load without authentication
- Need Supabase credentials to test

---

### 5. Resume Builder - Limit Checks ⚠️

**Test**: Try to create 2nd resume
```
1. Go to /app/resume-builder
2. Create and save 1 resume
3. Try to save a 2nd resume
4. Try to export PDF
```

**Expected**:
- ⚠️ Upgrade prompt SHOULD appear for 2nd resume
- ⚠️ Upgrade prompt SHOULD appear for PDF export
- ✅ Premium badge visible on Export button

**Actual Result** (Need to verify):
- Upgrade prompts will appear for ALL users (everyone is "free tier")
- Cannot test premium unlock without Stripe

---

### 6. Job Search - Limit Checks ⚠️

**Test**: Try to save 6 jobs
```
1. Go to /app/job-search
2. Save 5 jobs successfully
3. Try to save a 6th job
```

**Expected**:
- ⚠️ Upgrade prompt SHOULD appear on 6th job

**Actual Result** (Need to verify):
- Upgrade prompt will appear (everyone is "free tier")
- Cannot test premium unlock without Stripe

---

### 7. Upgrade Prompts UI ✅

**Test**: Check upgrade prompt styling
```
1. Trigger upgrade prompts (2nd resume or 6th job)
2. Check modal display
3. Check dark mode
4. Click "Upgrade Now" button
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Modal displays correctly
- ✅ Dark mode works
- ✅ "Upgrade Now" redirects to /pricing
- ❌ Cannot complete checkout (no Stripe)

---

## What CANNOT Be Tested (Without Stripe Setup)

### ❌ Payment Flow
- Creating checkout session
- Redirecting to Stripe
- Completing payment
- Webhook subscription updates

### ❌ Premium Access
- Unlocking features after payment
- Unlimited resumes
- Unlimited saved jobs
- PDF exports for premium users

### ❌ Subscription Management
- Viewing active subscription
- Opening customer portal
- Updating payment method
- Canceling subscription

### ❌ Feature Gating Accuracy
- Cannot test if premium users actually get unlimited access
- Cannot test subscription status checks
- Cannot test trial vs paid states

## Issues Found During Testing

### Issue 1: Missing Supabase Credentials
**Problem**: `.env` file doesn't have Supabase credentials
**Impact**: Cannot test authentication, data persistence
**Solution**: Follow `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` to get credentials

### Issue 2: Missing Stripe Credentials
**Problem**: `.env` file doesn't have Stripe API keys
**Impact**: Cannot test payments, premium features, checkout
**Solution**: Follow `STRIPE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to configure Stripe

### Issue 3: All Users Treated as Free Tier
**Problem**: Without Stripe, `isPremiumUser()` returns false for everyone
**Impact**: Cannot test premium feature unlock
**Solution**: Configure Stripe and create a test subscription

### Issue 4: Components Still Using localStorage
**Problem**: Resume and job data saved to localStorage, not Supabase
**Impact**: Data not persistent across devices, no multi-user support
**Solution**: Complete Phase 3 component migration (see `PHASE_3_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
