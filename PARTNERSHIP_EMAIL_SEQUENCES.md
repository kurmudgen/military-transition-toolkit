### Email 2: Follow-Up (No Response After 5-7 Days)

**Subject**: Re: Content Partnership Opportunity - Military.com

Hi Chris,

Following up on my content partnership inquiry from last week.

**Specific collaboration ideas:**
1. **Resource sharing:** We feature Military.com's transition guides; you feature specialized tools from our platform
2. **Content exchange:** Guest articles or co-authored pieces on transition topics
3. **Cross-linking:** Strategic links between complementary content on both sites

**Why this makes sense:**
- Different but complementary audiences (broad military vs. transition-focused)
- Mutual SEO and traffic benefits
- Better serves the military community through resource consolidation
- Low effort, high value for both parties

**Next step:** 15-minute call to explore partnership models?

If content partnerships aren't your area, could you direct me to the right person?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
