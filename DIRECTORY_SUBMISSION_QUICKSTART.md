## 📊 Tracking Sheet Template

Create a spreadsheet to track submissions:

| Directory | Date Submitted | Status | Approval Date | URL/Link | Traffic (Month 1) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|--------|---------------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Product Hunt | 2025-11-XX | Pending | - | - | - | Scheduled for [date] |

## 🎯 UTM Parameter Strategy

Add UTM parameters to track traffic from each directory:

**Format:**

https://militarytransitiontoolkit.com/?utm_source=[directory]&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=directory_launch
```

**Examples:**
- Product Hunt: `?utm_source=producthunt&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=directory_launch`
- BetaList: `?utm_source=betalist&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=directory_launch`
- Indie Hackers: `?utm_source=indiehackers&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=directory_launch`

**Where to use:**
- Some directories let you add UTM params to your URL
- Use in first comments (Product Hunt)
- Use in additional links section

**Tracking:**
- Set up Google Analytics or Plausible
- Monitor which directories drive most traffic
- Double down on high-performing channels
