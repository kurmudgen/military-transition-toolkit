## Social Proof Section

### Section Headline
**Veterans Who Made The Switch**

### Testimonial 1: From Scattered to Organized
"I had bookmarks in 3 different browsers, notes scattered across my phone and laptop, and no idea if I was missing something. MTT put everything in one place in like 2 hours. Should've done this months ago."
**— Sgt Reynolds, USMC, 8 years**

### Testimonial 2: Time Saved
"Was spending 2-3 hours every weekend researching. Now I spend maybe 20 minutes on MTT and I get better info. Got my weekends back and I'm more prepared than ever."
**— PO2 Chang, USN, 10 years**

### Testimonial 3: Benefits Found
"Used 4 different websites trying to figure out state benefits. MTT showed me everything in 5 minutes and I found $3,800 I didn't know about. This is wild."
**— SPC Torres, USA, 6 years**

### Testimonial 4: Simplicity
"Everything I was juggling across a dozen sites is now in one dashboard. I don't know why anyone would do this the old way. Easiest decision I made."
**— HM1 Brooks, USN, 14 years**

## FAQ Section

### Question 1: Do I have to stop using other resources?
No. MTT doesn't replace VA.gov or Military OneSource—it organizes and supplements them. Use MTT as your central dashboard, and we'll link you to official resources when needed. Think of us as your command center.

### Question 2: How do you keep information up to date when state benefits change?
We monitor all 50 states for benefit changes and update our guides quarterly (or immediately for major changes). You're currently relying on yourself to check every state website—we do that work for you.

### Question 3: What if I've already organized everything myself?
Honestly? You've probably still missed benefits, and you're spending time maintaining that organization. Plus, our calculators and tools go beyond what you can do with bookmarks and spreadsheets. Try the free trial—you might be surprised.

### Question 4: Can I import my existing research/bookmarks?
Not automatically (yet), but you can manually add notes and links to your MTT dashboard. We're working on a bookmark import feature. That said, most users find they don't need their old bookmarks once they're using MTT.

### Question 5: What happens to my data if I cancel?
You can export everything (notes, saved resources, profile data) before canceling. We don't hold your data hostage. You can download a PDF report of your benefits, transition plan, and saved resources anytime.

### Question 6: Is there a free version?
Currently yes—during the government shutdown, everything is free while .mil verification is down. After that, we'll have a limited free tier with basic tools, but most features require a paid membership.

### Question 7: How does this compare to TAP class materials?
TAP gives you the foundation—we give you the tools to actually use what you learned. TAP is educational, MTT is operational. You need both, but TAP doesn't give you a GI Bill calculator or state benefits comparison tool.

## Design Notes

### Layout Recommendations
- **Hero:** Split-screen design—left side shows messy browser tabs, right side shows clean MTT dashboard
- **Comparison Table:** High-contrast striped rows. Red X's for "old way," green checks for "MTT way."
- **What You Get:** Expandable sections for each platform replacement (click to see details)
- **Pricing:** Side-by-side comparison with "hidden costs" on left, "MTT pricing" on right
- **Final CTA:** Full-width with before/after images (tabs vs dashboard)

### Color Psychology
- **Primary:** Blue (#3B82F6) = trust, organization, clarity
- **Secondary:** Green (#10B981) = "better way," efficiency, success
- **Warning/Old Way:** Red (#EF4444) = chaos, problems, scattered
- **Background:** Clean white with subtle gray sections for separation

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Hero comparison (visual immediate impact)
2. Comparison table (logical argument)
3. "What You Get" breakdown (detail for skeptics)
4. Pricing transparency (address cost concerns)
5. Social proof (validation)
6. Final CTA (decision point)

### CTA Button Colors/Placement
- **Hero CTA:** Green (#10B981), "Consolidate Your Transition - Start Free"
- **Mid-page CTAs:** Blue buttons in "What You Get" sections
- **Final CTA:** Large green button with before/after visuals above
- Emphasis on "consolidate" and "simplify" language

### Image Suggestions
- **Hero:** Actual screenshot of 12 browser tabs vs MTT dashboard (side-by-side)
- **Comparison:** Icons for X (red) and check (green) in table
- **What You Get:** Screenshots of each MTT tool/section
- **Pricing:** Infographic showing hidden costs vs MTT value
- **Final CTA:** Before/after visual (tabs → dashboard)

## A/B Test Hypothesis

### What We're Testing
**Primary:** Does a direct comparison/alternative positioning convert better than other messaging angles?

**Secondary:** Does emphasizing "consolidation" and "simplification" resonate more than benefits, features, or story?

**Tertiary:** Does showing the "hidden cost" of the scattered approach motivate action?

### Expected Winner
**Moderate-to-high confidence** this will perform well with:
- **Organized personalities** who value efficiency and systems
- **Mid-transition users** who are already feeling the pain of scattered resources
- **Analytical thinkers** who respond to logical comparisons

**May underperform with:**
- **Early-stage users** who haven't felt the pain yet
- **Emotional decision-makers** who need story/trust first
- **Skeptics** who think "I can do this myself"

**Prediction:** Strong performer overall, likely in top 4. Will excel with paid traffic (Google Ads) where users are actively searching for solutions.

### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Free trial sign-up rate (target: 14%+ — higher for comparison-driven users)
- **Secondary:** Trial-to-paid conversion rate (target: 7%+)
- **Engagement:** Interaction with comparison table (target: 70%+ expand/scroll)
- **Quality:** Time to first upgrade (expect faster—these users are ready to buy)
- **Source performance:** Expect strong performance from paid search traffic

### Statistical Significance Needed
- Minimum 250 visitors per variant
- 95% confidence level
- Run for 10-14 days
- Segment by traffic source (hypothesis: paid search will love this variant)
- Track scroll depth to comparison table (key engagement metric)

## Mobile Optimization Notes

### Critical Elements
1. **Hero:** Stack comparison vertically on mobile—"Old Way" section, then "MTT Way" section
2. **Comparison Table:** Convert to cards on mobile—swipe between "Old Way" and "MTT Way"
3. **What You Get:** Accordion-style collapsed sections (tap to expand each platform)
4. **Pricing:** Stack vertically, emphasize free trial
5. **Final CTA:** Sticky bottom button with "Consolidate Now" text

### Mobile-Specific Copy Adjustments
- Hero headline: "Stop Juggling 12 Websites"
- Subheadline: Shorten to "Everything you need in one dashboard."
- Comparison table: Show 5 key comparisons on mobile (vs all 10 on desktop)
- CTA: "Start Free Trial" (consolidate message in subtext)

### Performance
- Hero comparison images: <150KB total
- Lazy load comparison table rows
- Preload first 3 "What You Get" sections
- Optimize all screenshots to <100KB each
