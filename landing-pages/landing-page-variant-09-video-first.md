## Video Script (For Reference)

### Opening (0:00-0:15)
*[Screen: Founder at desk with laptop, casual/authentic setting]*

**Voiceover:** "Hey, I'm a Navy E6, 19 years in, medically retiring in February. I built Military Transition Toolkit because transition was way more complicated than it needed to be. Let me show you what I made in about 2 minutes."

---

### Dashboard Overview (0:15-0:30)
*[Screen: MTT dashboard with tool categories visible]*

**Voiceover:** "This is your dashboard. Everything you need for transition in one place. Career planning, state benefits, VA resources, financial tools. No more juggling 12 different websites."

*[Cursor hovers over each category]*

---

### State Benefits Demo (0:30-0:55)
*[Screen: State benefits comparison tool]*

**Voiceover:** "Here's the state benefits guide. Pick your state—let's say Texas—and it shows you every veteran benefit. Property tax exemptions, education grants, employment advantages, license fee waivers."

*[Scrolling through Texas benefits]*

**Voiceover:** "I found $4,200 in benefits I didn't know about. Most people find $15K on average. It's ridiculous how much gets missed."

*[Shows comparison tool with Texas vs Florida]*

**Voiceover:** "You can compare states side-by-side if you're deciding where to move. Saved me weeks of research."

---

### Career Tools (0:55-1:15)
*[Screen: MOS translator]*

**Voiceover:** "Career planning. I'm a Machinist's Mate—civilians don't know what that is. The MOS translator shows me: mechanical engineer, industrial mechanic, maintenance supervisor. Plus salary ranges."

*[Shows results with salary data]*

**Voiceover:** "Now I know what jobs to apply for and what I'm worth. Game changer."

*[Quick cut to resume builder]*

---

### VA & GI Bill Tools (1:15-1:40)

**Voiceover:** "GI Bill calculator actually works—unlike every other one I tried. Put in your school, your zip code, it tells you exact value including BAH."

*[Shows calculation: $87,400 total value]*

**Voiceover:** "$87K for my situation. That's real money."

*[Cut to VA claim guidance]*

**Voiceover:** "VA claim guidance—when to file, what to document, how to get the best outcome. I filed using this and got approved in 4 months."

---

### Financial Planning (1:40-1:55)
*[Screen: Budget calculator]*

**Voiceover:** "Financial planning tools. Military pay vs civilian offers—shows you the REAL difference after you lose BAH, BAS, free healthcare."

*[Shows comparison]*

**Voiceover:** "I almost took a job that looked like a raise but was actually a pay cut. These tools saved me from that mistake."

---

### Closing (1:55-2:03)
*[Screen: Back to founder at desk]*

**Voiceover:** "Everything's organized, up-to-date, built by someone who's going through this with you. 7-day free trial. No credit card. Check it out."

## FAQ Section

### Question 1: Do I have to watch the whole video?
No, but it helps. The video gives you a full platform overview in 2 minutes. If you'd rather read, scroll down—we have detailed feature descriptions. But most people find the video way easier to digest.

### Question 2: Is the platform really as simple as the video makes it look?
Yes. We designed it to be clean and easy to navigate. If you can check email, you can use this. No complicated menus, no overwhelm—just organized tools.

### Question 3: Who's the person in the video?
That's the founder—a Navy Machinist's Mate (E6), 19 years in, medically retiring in February 2025. He built this platform while going through his own transition. Real veteran, not an actor.

### Question 4: Can I see a live demo before signing up?
The video IS the live demo—real platform, real features, real data. But if you want to try it yourself, the 7-day free trial gives you full access. No credit card required.

### Question 5: What if I'm not comfortable on camera for testimonials?
We don't require testimonials or your info. Use the platform privately. The only reason we have testimonials is because users voluntarily reached out to share their experience.

### Question 6: Will there be more videos (tutorials, guides, etc.)?
Yes. We're building a video library with specific tutorials: "How to use the state comparison tool," "How to file a VA claim," "How to translate your MOS," etc. Coming soon.

### Question 7: Can I share this video with other veterans?
Absolutely. Share it with anyone who's transitioning. The whole point is to help as many veterans as possible simplify their transitions.

## Design Notes

### Layout Recommendations
- **Hero:** Video player takes up 80% of above-fold space—make it THE focus
- **Below Video:** Large CTA button, supporting text minimal
- **Key Takeaways:** Grid layout with icons, scannable summary of video content
- **Features:** Simple list format (not heavy detail—video did the showing)
- **Final CTA:** Include "Watch Again" option for users who want to rewatch

### Color Psychology
- **Primary:** Red (#EF4444) = video play button, attention, action
- **Secondary:** Blue (#3B82F6) = trust, professionalism
- **CTA:** Green (#10B981) = "try it yourself" action
- **Background:** Dark or neutral for video contrast

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Video (largest, central, above fold)
2. Video title/description (supports video)
3. CTA below video (immediate action)
4. Key takeaways (for those who skipped)
5. Features (summary list)
6. Final CTA (reinforcement)

### CTA Button Colors/Placement
- **Hero CTA (below video):** Large green button, "Try It Yourself - Start Free Trial"
- **Mid-page CTAs:** Minimal—don't distract from video
- **Final CTA:** Green button + "Watch Again" secondary button (blue)
- Keep CTAs simple—video does the selling

### Image Suggestions
- **Hero:** Video player with custom thumbnail (founder or dashboard screenshot)
- **Key Takeaways:** Icons for each takeaway (simple, clean)
- **Features:** Minimal icons, don't compete with video content
- **Final CTA:** Small thumbnail of video with "Watch Again" text
- **Overall:** Let video be the star—minimal competing visuals

## A/B Test Hypothesis

### What We're Testing
**Primary:** Does video-first approach (showing vs telling) convert better than text-heavy landing pages?

**Secondary:** Does seeing a real person (founder) build more trust than anonymous corporate copy?

**Tertiary:** Does demonstrating the platform reduce hesitation vs describing features?

### Expected Winner
**Moderate-to-high confidence**, but with caveats:

**Will perform well with:**
- **Visual learners** who prefer watching over reading
- **Skeptical users** who want to see proof before believing
- **Users on fast internet** (video loads quickly)
- **Desktop users** (larger screen = better video experience)

**May underperform with:**
- **Users on slow internet** (video doesn't load = immediate bounce)
- **Mobile users** (smaller screen, data concerns)
- **Text-preference users** who don't want to watch videos
- **Users in hurry** (video takes time vs scanning text)

**Prediction:** Strong performer with desktop traffic and visual learners. May underperform with mobile traffic. Overall rank: 4th-6th place.

**Critical success factor:** Video quality must be professional but authentic. Too polished = loses veteran credibility. Too rough = looks unprofessional.

### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Video completion rate (target: 60%+ watch at least 1 minute)
- **Secondary:** Free trial sign-up rate (target: 15%+ for users who watch video)
- **Engagement:** Play rate (target: 70%+ of visitors click play)
- **Quality:** Trial-to-paid conversion (expect higher—video builds strong trust)
- **Segment:** Desktop vs mobile performance (expect large gap)

### Statistical Significance Needed
- Minimum 300 visitors per variant (video needs more volume)
- 95% confidence level
- Run for 14 days
- Track video engagement metrics separately (play rate, watch time, completion rate)
- Segment by device (desktop vs mobile) and internet speed if possible

---

## Mobile Optimization Notes

### Critical Elements
1. **Video Player:** Must work flawlessly on mobile—native controls, smooth playback
2. **Video File Size:** Optimize heavily for mobile (<10MB for 2-minute video)
3. **Thumbnail:** Compelling thumbnail with play button—make it clear it's a video
4. **Fallback:** Key takeaways section IS the fallback if user doesn't watch video
5. **CTA:** Sticky bottom bar with "Start Free Trial" always visible

### Mobile-Specific Copy Adjustments
- Hero: "Watch: 2-Min Walkthrough" (shorter)
- Below video: Larger CTA button (50% of screen width)
- Key takeaways: Show all 6 (critical for non-watchers)
- Video script: Ensure captions/subtitles available (many watch on mute)

### Performance
- **Critical:** Serve different video file sizes by device (720p mobile, 1080p desktop)
- Lazy load everything below video
- Preload video thumbnail (instant display)
- Consider YouTube embed vs self-hosted (YouTube = better performance, self-hosted = more control)

---

## Video Production Notes (For Reference)

### Video Requirements
- **Length:** 2-3 minutes maximum (2:03 ideal)
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Audio:** Clear, professional microphone (no echo/background noise)
- **Lighting:** Good lighting on speaker, clear visibility
- **Editing:** Minimal—cuts to screen shares, simple transitions
- **Branding:** Logo/URL at beginning and end

### Script Guidelines
- **Tone:** Conversational, veteran-to-veteran
- **Pace:** Moderate (not too fast, not too slow)
- **Language:** No jargon, plain English
- **Authenticity:** Real person, real story, no acting
- **Call to Action:** Clear at end ("Check it out, free trial")

### Screen Capture
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 minimum
- **Cursor:** Visible and easy to follow
- **Navigation:** Slow enough to be clear, fast enough to not bore
- **Highlights:** Use highlights/arrows to draw attention (optional)

### Production Quality
- **Professional enough:** Good audio, good lighting, smooth editing
- **Not TOO polished:** Should feel authentic, not corporate/overly produced
- **Balance:** Quality that builds trust but maintains veteran authenticity

---

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-12
**Variant:** 09 - Video-First
**Status:** Ready for A/B Testing
**Special Note:** Success of this variant is HEAVILY dependent on video quality. Video must be professionally produced but authentically delivered. Consider hiring video editor if necessary—quality matters here more than any other variant. Also consider creating shorter variations (30-second, 60-second) for A/B testing video length.

**Video Production Priority:** If resources are limited, this variant should wait until quality video can be produced. Better to launch other variants first than to launch this one with mediocre video.
