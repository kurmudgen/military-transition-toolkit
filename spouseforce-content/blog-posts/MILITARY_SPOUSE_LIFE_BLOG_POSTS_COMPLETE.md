### The Friend-Making Framework

**Week 3-4: Start Showing Up**

### Where to Find Your People

- **MWR Programs:** Fitness classes, crafts, trips
- **Chapel:** Services, Bible studies, groups
- **Volunteer:** Thrift store, library, events

**Off-Base:**

- **Local Facebook Groups:** "Military Spouses [Location]"

**Online:**
- Facebook groups for your installation
- Military spouse career groups
- Interest-based groups (fitness, crafts, books)

### The Art of Making Friends as an Adult

**Be the Inviter:**
- Don't wait to be invited
- "Want to grab coffee this week?"
- Low-pressure, specific invites

**Follow Up:**
- Met someone nice? Text within 24-48 hours
- "So nice meeting you! Want to meet at the park Tuesday?"

**Be Consistent:**
- Show up regularly (same yoga class, coffee, etc.)
- Relationships need repeated exposure

**Be Authentic:**
- Share honestly (not oversharing, but real)
- Vulnerability builds connection
- It's okay to say "This PCS is hard"

**Give First:**
- Offer help before asking
- "I'm going to Target, need anything?"
- "Can I watch your kids so you can have a break?"

### Friend-Making Scripts

**At Spouse Club:**
"Hi! I'm [Name]. We just PCS'd here last month. Is this your first time at spouse club?"

**At Park:**
"Hi! I'm [Name]. We're new to the area. How old is your little one? Do you come here often?"

**Following Up:**
"Hey! It was so nice meeting you at [event]. Would you want to grab coffee sometime this week?"

**Inviting to Home:**
"I'm having a few people over for wine and apps on Friday night. Nothing fancy! Would you like to come?"

### Overcoming Friend-Making Obstacles

**Obstacle: "I'm introverted"**
- One-on-one coffee > big group events
- Quality over quantity (3-5 close friends, not 30)
- Online friendships count too
- Recharge alone time after social events

**Obstacle: "Everyone already has friends"**
- Not true - people move constantly on military bases
- Others want friends too
- Be persistent (doesn't happen overnight)

**Obstacle: "I'm only here for 1 year"**
- Friendships don't require years to be valuable
- Short-term friends still matter
- Stay in touch after you PCS (long-distance friends)

**Obstacle: "I work full-time / have no time"**
- Combine activities (workout class = friends + fitness)
- Weekends only (brunch dates, Saturday park)
- Virtual friends (military spouse communities online)

### Different Life Stages, Different Friends

**Stay-at-Home Moms:**
- Playgroups, MOMS Club
- Library story times
- Park meetups

**Working Spouses:**
- Weekend social events
- Online military spouse career groups
- Co-working spaces (if remote)

**No Kids:**
- Spouse clubs often have sub-groups
- Pursue hobbies (join running club, book club, etc.)
- Volunteer

**Older Kids/Teens:**
- Sports team parents
- School volunteer opportunities
- Neighborhood gatherings

### The Long Game: Portable Friendships

**Stay in Touch After PCS:**
- Text regularly
- Video calls
- Visit when possible
- Military spouse friends across duty stations = national network

**Build Virtual Community:**
- Military spouse Facebook groups
- Industry-specific communities
- Accountability groups online
- Military spouse podcasts/Instagram

### The Bottom Line
- Making friends takes effort (but worth it)
- Show up consistently
- Be the inviter
- Authentic connections matter more than quantity
- Friendships make military life sustainable

## Post 4: Managing Finances as a Military Spouse (Budgeting for Instability)

**Target Length:** 1,700 words

**Military Family Financial Framework:**

### Understanding Military Pay & Benefits

**Basic Pay:**
- Rank and time in service determine
- Paid twice monthly (1st and 15th)
- Taxable income

**BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing):**
- Based on rank, dependents, ZIP code
- Not taxable
- Changes with PCS

**BAS (Basic Allowance for Subsistence):**
- Food allowance for service member
- ~$300/month
- Not taxable

**Special Pays:**

- Varies by job and deployment
- Taxable

**Deployment Pay:**
- Imminent Danger Pay ($225/month)
- Family Separation Allowance ($250/month)
- Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (pay not taxed)

### The Military Spouse Budget Challenge

**Income Instability:**
- Spouse employment interrupted by PCS
- Deployment changes household income
- Special pays come and go

**Expense Variability:**
- PCS costs (even with reimbursement)
- Different cost of living each location
- Housing on-base vs off-base

**The Solution: Build for Worst Case, Save the Rest**

### The Zero-Based Budget for Military Families

**Income (Conservative Estimate):**
- Basic pay only (don't count deployment pay, special pays long-term)
- Spouse income: Use lowest consistent amount OR budget to zero if unstable

**Fixed Expenses:**
- Housing (rent/mortgage or on-base)
- Utilities
- Car payment
- Insurance (car, renters/homeowners)
- Phone
- Internet
- Debt minimum payments

**Variable Expenses:**
- Groceries
- Gas
- Household items
- Entertainment
- Clothing
- Kids activities

**Savings:**
- Emergency fund (Goal: $1,000, then 3-6 months expenses)
- PCS fund ($1,000-$3,000)
- Retirement (TSP)
- Goals (house, vacation, etc.)

### The 50/30/20 Budget (Military Adaptation)

**50% Needs:**
- Housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, minimum debt payments

**30% Wants:**
- Dining out, entertainment, hobbies, subscriptions, non-essentials

**20% Savings & Debt Payoff:**
- Emergency fund, retirement, extra debt payments, goal savings

**Military Adjustment:**
- If housing covered (on-base), apply that % to savings
- During deployment, save extra income
- During PCS, reduce wants category

### Emergency Fund Strategy

**Phase 1: $1,000 Fast**
- Cover most small emergencies (car repair, vet bill)
- Takes pressure off
- Save $100-$500/month until reached

**Phase 2: 3-6 Months Expenses**
- Calculate monthly expenses
- Multiply by 3-6 months
- Example: $4,000/month expenses × 3 = $12,000 goal
- Save consistently ($200-$500/month)

**Phase 3: PCS Fund ($1,000-$3,000)**
- Covers PCS expenses before reimbursement
- Move, hotels, gas, meals, deposits

### Managing Deployment Finances

**Prep Before Deployment:**
- Power of attorney
- Understand all accounts and bills
- Automate payments
- Create budget for deployment period

**During Deployment:**
- Service member: Save extra pay (combat zone tax exclusion)
- Spouse: Maintain budget, resist lifestyle creep
- Goal: Save 50-75% of extra deployment income

**Post-Deployment:**
- Don't immediately increase lifestyle
- Use saved deployment pay for: Emergency fund, debt payoff, goals

### Debt Management

**The Debt Snowball:**
1. List all debts smallest to largest
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Put extra money to smallest debt
4. When paid off, roll that payment to next smallest
5. Repeat until debt-free

**The Debt Avalanche:**
1. List debts highest interest rate to lowest
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Put extra to highest interest debt
4. When paid off, roll to next highest interest
5. Mathematically faster, saves most on interest

**Military-Specific Debt Help:**
- SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act): Interest rate cap of 6% on debt incurred before military service
- Financial counseling: Free through Military OneSource, Fleet and Family

### Retirement Savings (TSP)

**What is TSP?**
- Thrift Savings Plan (military 401k)
- Low fees (best in industry)
- Matching up to 5% (BRS - Blended Retirement System)

**How Much to Contribute:**
- Minimum: 5% (to get full match)
- Ideal: 10-15% if possible
- Start with match, increase 1%/year

**Roth vs Traditional TSP:**
- Roth: Pay taxes now, tax-free in retirement (better for lower-ranking)
- Traditional: Tax deduction now, pay taxes in retirement (better for higher-ranking)

**Spouse IRA:**
- Can contribute even if spouse not working
- Spousal IRA (Roth or Traditional)
- $6,500/year limit (2024)

### Managing PCS Financially

**Before PCS:**

**During PCS:**
- Track all expenses (for reimbursement)
- Use GTC (Government Travel Card) for authorized expenses
- Save receipts

**After PCS:**

- Replenish PCS fund with reimbursement
- Adjust budget to new cost of living

### Spouse Income Planning

**If Employment Unstable:**
- Budget to service member's income only
- Use spouse income for: Savings, debt payoff, goals
- Don't rely on spouse income for necessities

**If Employment Stable (Remote):**
- Can include in budget
- Still prioritize emergency fund
- Save 3-6 months expenses in case of job loss

### Financial Tools
