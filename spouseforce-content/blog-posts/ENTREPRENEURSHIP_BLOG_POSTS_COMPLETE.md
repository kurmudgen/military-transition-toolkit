## Post 9: Tax Tips for Military Spouse Entrepreneurs

**Target Length:** 1,500 words

**(Disclaimer: This is educational, consult CPA for your specific situation)**

**Business Structure & Taxes:**

**Sole Proprietorship:**
- Report on Schedule C (personal tax return)
- Pay self-employment tax (15.3% on profit)
- No separate business tax return

**LLC (Single-Member):**
- Same as sole prop (pass-through taxation)
- File Schedule C
- Liability protection separate from tax benefit

**S-Corp:**
- Separate tax return (Form 1120S)
- Pay yourself "reasonable salary" (W2)
- Remaining profit = distributions (lower tax)
- Worth it when profit >$60K (saves on self-employment tax)

**Tax Deductions for Home-Based Business:**

**Home Office Deduction:**
- Dedicated space for business only
- Simplified method: $5/square foot (up to 300 sq ft = $1,500)
- Actual method: % of home expenses (mortgage/rent, utilities, insurance)

**Equipment & Supplies:**
- Computer, phone, software, office furniture
- Fully deductible in year of purchase (Section 179)

**Internet & Phone:**
- Deduct business % (if also personal use)

- Pay quarterly (April 15, June 15, Sept 15, Jan 15)

**Record-Keeping:**

**Essential:**
