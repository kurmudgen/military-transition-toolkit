## How to Use Job Boards Effectively

### Strategy #1: Quality Over Quantity

**Don't:** Apply to 100 jobs with generic resume

**Do:** Apply to 10-15 carefully selected roles with customized applications

**Result:** Higher response rate, better fit

---

### Strategy #2: The Daily Routine (30 minutes/day)

**Monday-Friday:**
1. Check FlexJobs (10 min) - apply to 2-3 new postings
2. Check We Work Remotely (5 min) - apply to 1-2
3. Engage on LinkedIn (10 min) - comment, post, connect
4. Reach out to 1-2 hiring managers directly (5 min)

**Result:** 10-20 quality applications per week

---

### Strategy #3: The Application Funnel

**Week 1:** Apply to 15 jobs
**Week 2:** Follow up on Week 1 applications + apply to 15 new
**Week 3:** Interviews from Week 1 + follow-up Week 2 + apply to 15 new
**Week 4:** Second interviews + offers

**Timeline:** First offers typically 3-6 weeks

---

### Strategy #4: Track Everything

**Use spreadsheet:**
- Company name
- Job title
- Date applied
- Follow-up date
- Status (applied, interview, offer, rejected)
- Notes

**Why:** Stay organized, know when to follow up

---

## Red Flags: Scam Jobs to Avoid

**Avoid listings that:**
❌ Require payment to apply or get hired
❌ Promise "$5,000/week working 10 hours!" (unrealistic)
❌ Have vague job descriptions
❌ Ask for bank info or SSN before offer
❌ No company website or online presence
❌ Email from Gmail/Yahoo (not company domain)
❌ Pressure you to decide immediately

**Green Flags (Legitimate):**
✅ Clear job description with responsibilities
✅ Realistic salary range
✅ Company website and LinkedIn page
✅ Normal interview process
✅ References and background check
✅ Professional email domain
