# Career Planning During PCS: Your Step-by-Step Survival Guide

**PCS orders just dropped.**

You have 3-6 months before you pack up and move. For most military spouses, this triggers career panic:
- Do I tell my employer now or later?
- Should I quit or try to go remote?
- Do I job search before moving or after?
- How do I avoid a 6-month employment gap?
- Will I have to start over AGAIN?

**PCS doesn't have to mean career suicide.**

With the right plan, you can protect your income, maintain career momentum, and even advance during a PCS.

This guide gives you the exact playbook: what to do 6 months out, 3 months out, 1 month out, and after arrival.

## 6 Months Before PCS: Strategic Planning Phase

### Week 1: Assess Your Current Job's Portability

**Question: Can my current job become remote, or do I need to pivot?**

**Run This Assessment:**

✅ **Can your job be done 100% remotely?**
- If yes → Explore remote possibility with employer
- If no → Start planning transition

✅ **Is your employer open to remote work?**
- Check company policy
- Look for precedents (anyone working remotely?)
- Assess manager's flexibility

✅ **Is your role critical/valuable enough for employer to accommodate?**
- Have you been a top performer?
- Are you in a hard-to-fill role?
- Do you have unique skills/knowledge?

**3 Possible Outcomes:**

**Outcome A: High Remote Potential**
- Job can be remote + employer likely flexible + you're valued
- **Action: Prepare remote work proposal**

**Outcome B: Low Remote Potential**
- Job requires physical presence OR employer inflexible OR role easily replaced
- **Action: Plan job search at new location OR pivot to portable career**

**Outcome C: Uncertain**
- Could go either way
- **Action: Prepare for both scenarios (remote proposal + job search)**

---

### Week 2-3: Have "The Conversation" with Your Employer

**When to Tell Your Employer About PCS:**

**Tell Early (6 months out) IF:**
- You want to negotiate remote work
- You have good relationship with manager
- Company has remote precedents
- Your role is critical

**Tell Later (3 months out) IF:**
- Employer might replace you immediately
- No remote possibility
- You need income through last month
- Uncertain job security

**How to Have the Conversation:**

**Option 1: Requesting Remote Work**

*"I wanted to let you know early that my spouse received PCS orders to [location] with a move date of [date]. I've loved working here and contributing to [specific achievements]. Given that my role is primarily [tasks that can be remote], I'd like to propose transitioning to full-time remote work. I've prepared a proposal outlining how this would work. Can we schedule time to discuss?"*

**Prepare:**
- **Remote work proposal**: How you'll maintain productivity, communication plan, overlap hours, metrics to track success
- **Proof of performance**: Recent wins, metrics, positive feedback
- **Precedents**: Others working remotely (if any)

**Option 2: Giving Notice (if no remote option)**

*"I wanted to give you as much notice as possible: my spouse received PCS orders to [location], and we'll be moving [date]. I'm committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. I can help train my replacement and document all processes. What would be most helpful?"*

**Goal:** Leave on good terms, get strong reference, maybe severance

## Common PCS Career Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Waiting Until Last Minute to Plan

**Problem:** You tell employer 2 weeks before PCS, no time to negotiate remote or job search

**Fix:** Start planning 6 months out, or as soon as you get orders

---

### Mistake #2: Assuming Employer Will Say No to Remote

**Problem:** You quit without asking, miss opportunity to keep job

**Fix:** Always ask, prepare proposal, worst they can say is no

---

### Mistake #3: Not Networking Before Arrival

**Problem:** You arrive and start from zero, takes months to build network

**Fix:** Start virtual networking 3 months before arrival

---

### Mistake #4: Taking First Job Out of Desperation

**Problem:** You need income immediately, take underpaid job, get stuck

**Fix:** Build emergency fund, start job search BEFORE PCS, don't rush
