# Networking Strategies for Military Spouses: Build Connections That Survive Every PCS

**"Your network is your net worth."**

You've heard it a thousand times. And for military spouses, it's painfully true—and painfully difficult.

**The problem:**
- You build a network → PCS → lose it → start over
- Repeat every 2-3 years
- Never build the "deep" professional connections that lead to opportunities

**The solution:** Build a PORTABLE network that travels with you and grows stronger with each PCS.

This guide shows you how.

## The Two Types of Networks Military Spouses Need

### Network Type 1: Virtual/National Network (Portable)

**What It Is:**
Professional connections not tied to any geographic location. People you connect with online who become career allies regardless of where you live.

**Why You Need It:**
- Survives every PCS
- Compounds over time (grows stronger, not weaker, with moves)
- Opens remote job opportunities
- Provides support during transitions

**Where to Build It:**
- LinkedIn
- Industry-specific Slack/Discord communities
- Virtual conferences and webinars
- Online courses and bootcamps (classmates)
- Military spouse career groups (Facebook, SpouseForce, etc.)
- Twitter/X (for some industries)

**Goal:** 100-500 meaningful virtual connections in your industry

---

### Network Type 2: Local Network (Temporary but Valuable)

**What It Is:**
Face-to-face professional connections at your current duty station.

**Why You Need It:**
- Opens local job opportunities
- Provides immediate support and friendship
- Helps you integrate quickly at new location
- Can transition to virtual network when you PCS

**Where to Build It:**
- Installation spouse clubs, FRGs
- Local chambers of commerce
- Professional associations (local chapters)
- Co-working spaces
- Meetup groups
- Volunteer organizations

**Goal:** 20-50 local connections per duty station

**Strategy:** Build quickly (within 3 months of arrival), nurture while there, convert to virtual connections when you PCS

---

## The Military Spouse Networking Timeline

### 3 Months BEFORE PCS: Pre-Network at New Location

**Goal:** Have 10-20 virtual connections at new location before you arrive

**Actions:**

✅ **Week 1-2: Research**
- Google: "[your profession] + [new city]"
- LinkedIn: Search people in your field at new location
- Find local professional groups on Facebook, Meetup

✅ **Week 3-4: Reach Out**

**Template Email/LinkedIn Message:**

*"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name], a [your profession] and military spouse. We're PCSing to [city] in [month], and I'm starting to build my professional network there. I saw that you work in [industry/role], and I'd love to connect and learn about the [city] job market / [industry] scene there. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute Zoom call? I'm happy to work around your schedule. Thank you!"*

**Why It Works:**
- Short and specific
- Clear ask (15 min = low barrier)
- Explains your situation
- Flattering (you chose them to reach out to)

✅ **Week 5-12: Coffee Chats (Virtual)**
- Aim for 2-3 virtual coffee chats per week
- Ask about job market, companies, cost of living, best places to network locally
- End each call: "Is there anyone else you'd recommend I connect with?"

**Result:** You arrive with warm connections, job leads, and insider knowledge

---

### UPON ARRIVAL: Activate Local Network Fast

**Goal:** Meet 20 new people in first 60 days

**Week 1-2: Join Online Groups**
- Local military spouse Facebook groups
- "[City] Young Professionals"
- Industry-specific local groups
- Nextdoor (yes, really—for service provider connections)

**Week 3-4: Attend 2-3 Events**
- Installation spouse club meet-and-greet
- Chamber of commerce mixer
- Professional association meeting
- Volunteer opportunity

**Week 5-8: Schedule Coffee Chats**
- Meet 2-3 new people per week
- Ask for intros to others

**Result:** Quickly integrated, visible, top-of-mind for opportunities

---

### WHILE STATIONED (Ongoing): Maintain and Deepen

**Monthly Actions:**
- Attend 1-2 networking events (in-person or virtual)
- Have 2-4 coffee chats with new or existing connections
- Engage on LinkedIn (comment, share, post) 3x/week
- Help someone in your network (make an intro, share a resource)

**Result:** Strong network that generates opportunities organically

---

### 3 MONTHS BEFORE NEXT PCS: Convert Local to Virtual

**Goal:** Keep your best connections as you leave

**Actions:**
✅ **Connect on LinkedIn** (if you haven't already)
✅ **Schedule goodbye coffee chats** with top 10-15 connections
✅ **Ask for LinkedIn recommendations**
✅ **Offer to stay in touch** and help them from afar

**What to Say:**

*"I've really valued getting to know you during our time here. I'd love to stay connected as we PCS to [new location]. Let's connect on LinkedIn, and please don't hesitate to reach out if I can ever help with [referrals, advice, connections, etc.]. I'm happy to make intros or be a resource however I can!"*

**Result:** Your network grows with each PCS instead of resetting

---

## Virtual Networking Tactics (That Actually Work)

### Tactic #1: Strategic LinkedIn Engagement

**The Strategy:**
Engage with content from people you want to connect with BEFORE you reach out.

**How:**
1. Identify 20-30 people in your industry you want to connect with
2. Follow them on LinkedIn
3. For 2-3 weeks, comment thoughtfully on their posts
4. THEN send connection request with personalized note

**Example:**

*"Hi [Name], I've really enjoyed your recent posts about [topic]—especially your take on [specific point]. I'm a [your profession] and fellow [shared interest/background], and I'd love to connect and learn from your insights. Thanks!"*

**Why It Works:**
- You're not a stranger (they've seen your name in comments)
- Demonstrates genuine interest
- Personalized = higher acceptance rate

---

### Tactic #2: The "Informational Interview" Approach

**Best For:** Learning about new career paths, companies, or industries

**How:**
1. Identify person in role/company you're interested in
2. Reach out with specific ask

**Template:**

*"Hi [Name], I'm exploring a transition into [field/role], and I came across your profile. Your background in [specific experience] is exactly what I'm trying to learn more about. Would you be open to a 20-minute call where I could ask you a few questions about your career path? I'm a military spouse currently researching my next career move as we prepare to PCS. I'd be so grateful for your insights!"*

**Key Points:**
- Specific time limit (20 min = low commitment)
- Clear ask (not asking for job, just advice)
- Explain why you chose them specifically

**In the Call:**
- Ask about their career journey
- Ask what they wish they'd known starting out
- Ask about skills most valuable in the role
- End: "Is there anyone else you'd recommend I speak with?"

**Follow-Up:**
- Send thank-you note within 24 hours
- Share anything useful you find later
- Stay in touch periodically

**Result:** Genuine connection, insider knowledge, expanded network (through referrals)

---

### Tactic #3: Join Online Communities Where Your People Are

**Where to Find Them:**

**For Tech:**
- Reddit: r/webdev, r/datascience, r/cscareerquestions
- Slack: Tech Ladies, Developer Hangout, DataTalks.Club

**For Marketing:**
- Slack: Online Geniuses, Growth Marketers
- Facebook: Digital Marketing Questions

**For Military Spouses:**
- Facebook: MilSpouse Coders, Instant Teams Military Spouse Network
- Slack: SpouseForce community

**For Entrepreneurs:**
- Indie Hackers (indiehackers.com)
- Reddit: r/entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness

**How to Network in Communities:**
- Contribute value (answer questions, share resources)
- Ask thoughtful questions
- DM people whose answers resonate with you
- Offer to help (make intros, give feedback)

**Result:** Relationships built on mutual help → opportunities

---

### Tactic #4: The "Give First" Strategy

**Concept:** Help people BEFORE asking for anything.

**How:**
- See someone asking for recommendations? Offer one.
- See someone stuck on a problem you can solve? Help.
- See someone who'd benefit from connecting with someone you know? Make the intro.
- Share someone's content, tag them, boost their visibility

**Example:**

You see on LinkedIn: *"Looking for a good freelance writer for tech content."*

You respond: *"I know a great tech writer. Let me intro you—DMing you now."*

You make the intro. You've now helped TWO people.

**Result:** People remember who helped them. When they see opportunities, they think of you.

---

## Networking Scripts That Work

### Script #1: Cold LinkedIn Connection Request

**Bad:**
*"I'd like to add you to my professional network."* (Generic, no effort)

**Good:**
*"Hi [Name]! I'm [Your Name], a [profession] and military spouse. I came across your work on [specific thing], and I really appreciated your perspective on [specific point]. I'd love to connect and follow your insights. Thanks!"*

**Better:**
*"Hi [Name]! Fellow [shared background—military spouse, UX designer, etc.] here. I saw your recent post about [topic], and it really resonated—especially when you mentioned [specific detail]. I'd love to connect and keep learning from your experiences. Excited to follow your journey!"*

---

### Script #2: Following Up After Event

**Timing:** Within 24-48 hours of meeting

**Template:**

*"Hi [Name], It was great meeting you at [event] yesterday! I really enjoyed our conversation about [topic you discussed]. I'd love to stay in touch and continue the conversation. Would you be open to grabbing coffee [or: hopping on a quick Zoom call] in the next week or two? Let me know what works for your schedule!"*

**If they mentioned something specific:**

*"Also, I found that article you mentioned about [topic]—here's the link: [link]. Thanks for the recommendation!"*

---

### Script #3: Asking for an Introduction

**Template:**

*"Hi [Mutual Connection], Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I saw that you're connected with [Target Person] on LinkedIn. I'm really interested in learning more about [their company / their role / their career path] as I explore [my career goal]. Would you feel comfortable making an introduction? I'd be so grateful. Let me know—happy to send over any context that would be helpful! Thanks!"*

**Make it easy for them:**
- Offer to write the intro message they can forward
- Be specific about why you want to connect
- Make the ask clear and low-effort

## Common Networking Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### Mistake #1: Waiting Until You NEED Something to Network

**Problem:** You only reach out when desperate for job/favor = transactional

**Fix:** Network continuously. Build relationships when you DON'T need anything.

---

### Mistake #2: Not Following Up

**Problem:** You meet someone great, never follow up, connection dies

**Fix:**
- Add to calendar: "Follow up with [Name]" 1 week after meeting
- Send quick note, share relevant article, or just check in
- Maintain with quarterly touchpoints

---

### Mistake #3: Only Networking "Up"

**Problem:** Only connecting with senior people, ignoring peers

**Fix:** Your peers are your future senior connections. Build relationships at all levels. Help each other rise.

---

### Mistake #4: Not Leveraging Your Military Spouse Status

**Problem:** Hiding that you're a military spouse out of fear it's a liability

**Fix:** **Own it.** Military spouse networks are STRONG. Use military spouse-specific hashtags (#MilSpouse, #MilitarySpouse), join mil spouse groups, identify yourself in bio. Other mil spouses WILL help you.

---

### Mistake #5: Giving Up After One PCS

**Problem:** "I built a network and lost it, so what's the point?"

**Fix:** Shift to PORTABLE network strategy. Build virtual connections that compound over time.

---

## How to Network as an Introvert

**You don't have to be extroverted to network well.**

### Introvert-Friendly Strategies:

✅ **One-on-one over group events**
- Coffee chats > large mixers
- Virtual calls > in-person crowds

✅ **Online engagement over in-person**
- LinkedIn commenting > conference networking
- Slack communities > networking events

✅ **Quality over quantity**
- Aim for 10 deep connections, not 100 superficial ones

✅ **Prepare conversation starters**
- Have 3-5 questions ready:
  - "What are you working on lately that excites you?"
  - "How did you get into [your field]?"
  - "What's the best career advice you've ever received?"

✅ **Use your listening skills**
- Introverts often listen better = deeper connections
- Ask follow-up questions, remember details

✅ **Schedule recovery time**
- After networking event, block time to recharge
- Don't over-commit to events—1-2/month is fine
