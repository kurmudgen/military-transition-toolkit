# Finding Your Career Path: Best Assessment Tools & Resources for Military Spouses

**"I have no idea what career to choose."**

You've had 3-5 different jobs across multiple fields because of PCS moves. You haven't had the luxury of "following a passion" or "building a career ladder."

You've survived. You've adapted. You've taken what was available.

**But now you want to be STRATEGIC.**

You want to choose a portable career that:
✅ Actually fits your natural strengths
✅ Interests you enough to sustain through challenges
✅ Aligns with your values and lifestyle
✅ Pays well and has growth potential

**How do you figure out what that career is?**

**Career assessments.**

This guide covers the best tools to discover your ideal career path—plus how to interpret results and take action.

## Why Career Assessments Matter (Especially for Military Spouses)

**Civilians can experiment:**
- Try a job for 3 years, pivot if it doesn't fit
- Explore different industries gradually
- Build expertise slowly in one city

**Military spouses don't have that luxury.**

**You need to:**
- Choose strategically (portability is non-negotiable)
- Get it right the first time (limited time to experiment between PCS moves)
- Leverage your natural strengths (faster learning curve = faster income)

**Career assessments help you:**
- Identify careers you'll naturally excel at
- Avoid wasting time/money on wrong paths
- Make data-driven decisions (not just guessing)
- Understand what motivates and drains you
