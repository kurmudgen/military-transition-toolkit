# Software Developer / Web Developer: Complete Guide for Military Spouses (2024-2025)

## Why This Career is Ideal for Military Spouses

Software development and web development represent some of the most portable and lucrative career paths available to military spouses. With the technology industry's widespread embrace of remote work, developers can maintain their careers through every PCS move, deployment, and relocation.

**Key advantages for military spouses:**

- **100% Remote Opportunities**: The majority of software development roles offer fully remote work, eliminating the need to job hunt with each PCS
- **High Earning Potential**: Entry-level developers earn $55,000-$75,000, with mid-level developers earning $80,000-$120,000 and senior developers commanding $120,000-$180,000+
- **Flexible Hours**: Many development roles offer flexible scheduling, crucial for managing military family life
- **Global Job Market**: Work for companies anywhere in the world without relocating
- **Continuous Learning**: The field values skills over formal degrees, making career pivots accessible
- **Strong Job Security**: Tech talent shortage means consistent demand for qualified developers
- **Freelance Options**: Build a freelance practice that travels with you, offering complete schedule control

The skills you develop are universally transferable, recession-resistant, and increasingly essential across all industries. Whether your family is stationed in Hawaii, Germany, or rural America, your development career can continue without interruption.

## Remote vs. On-Site Considerations

### Fully Remote Roles (Most Common for Developers)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintain employment through PCS moves
- ✅ Work from anywhere with internet connection
- ✅ Flexible hours to accommodate military family schedules
- ✅ No commute time or expense
- ✅ Access to global job market, not limited to local area
- ✅ Often better work-life balance

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Requires self-discipline and time management
- ❌ Potential isolation without in-person team interaction
- ❌ Need reliable home internet (crucial consideration for military housing)
- ❌ Time zone coordination for distributed teams
- ❌ Home office setup costs

**Best Practices for Remote Success:**
- Establish dedicated workspace separate from family areas
- Invest in quality internet (upgrade if necessary, deduct as business expense)
- Set clear boundaries with family during work hours
- Over-communicate with remote team members
- Utilize video calls to build relationships with colleagues

### Hybrid Roles

**Structure**: Combination of remote and in-office work (e.g., 2-3 days in office)

**Considerations for Military Spouses:**
- ⚠️ Less portable than fully remote—requires job change with each PCS
- ⚠️ Office location must be accessible from current duty station
- ✅ Can provide better networking and mentorship opportunities
- ✅ Easier for entry-level developers to get support and learn

**When Hybrid Makes Sense:**
- You're in a major tech hub (San Diego, Seattle, DC area, Austin)
- Planning to stay at current duty station for 3+ years
- Early career and want in-person mentorship
- Company offers PCS flexibility or remote transition option

### On-Site Roles

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Most challenging for military spouse longevity
- ⚠️ Requires job change with each PCS
- ✅ Can work for positions at installations or nearby major cities
- ✅ May offer higher starting salaries in tech hubs

**When On-Site Might Work:**
- Defense contractor roles at the installation where your spouse is stationed
- You're established in your career and can negotiate remote transition
- Short-term contract roles to gain experience before transitioning to remote

**Recommendation**: Prioritize fully remote roles to maximize career continuity and portability. If considering hybrid or on-site, negotiate remote provisions for PCS situations upfront.
