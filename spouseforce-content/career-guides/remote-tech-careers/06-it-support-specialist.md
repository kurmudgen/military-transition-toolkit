## Remote vs. On-Site Considerations

### Fully Remote Roles (Growing in IT Support - 70-80%)

**Why Remote IT Support is Increasing:**
- Remote support tools (TeamViewer, LogMeIn) enable helping users from anywhere
- Cloud-based ticketing systems accessible remotely
- Many user issues solvable remotely (password resets, software troubleshooting, network config)
- COVID-19 accelerated remote support acceptance

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintain employment through PCS moves
- ✅ Access to national job market
- ✅ Flexible hours (many IT support roles offer evening/weekend shifts - can work around military family schedule)
- ✅ No commute
- ✅ Home office setup travels with you

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Can't physically touch hardware (remote-only troubleshooting)
- ❌ Requires excellent communication skills (no in-person pointing)
- ❌ May include rotating shifts or on-call (24/7 support coverage)
- ❌ Need reliable home internet (critical)
- ❌ Can feel isolated on help desk team

**Remote Success Tips:**
- Set up dedicated workspace with dual monitors (one for user's screen, one for documentation)
- Excellent headset for phone/video support
- Reliable internet (upgrade if necessary, may be tax-deductible)
- Over-communicate via ticketing system and team chat
- Be patient and clear in remote troubleshooting instructions
- Document solutions thoroughly for other technicians

### Hybrid Roles (Common in IT Support)

**Structure**: 2-3 days on-site, rest remote (common for desktop support)

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Less portable—requires new job with each PCS
- ⚠️ Office must be near current duty station
- ✅ Hands-on hardware troubleshooting experience
- ✅ Easier to build relationships with users and team
- ✅ Better learning for entry-level (shadow senior techs)
- ✅ Access to equipment and tools

**When Hybrid Makes Sense:**
- Entry-level and want in-person mentorship
- Stationed near major city or installation with IT opportunities
- Planning to stay at location 3+ years
- Company offers remote transition option for PCS

### On-Site Roles (Still Common for Desktop Support)

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Most challenging for military spouse career continuity
- ⚠️ Common for desktop support, deskside support roles
- ⚠️ Requires job change with each PCS
- ✅ Hands-on hardware experience (valuable for skill development)
- ✅ Face-to-face user interaction
- ✅ May pay higher in certain markets

**When On-Site Might Work:**
- Short-term contract to gain hands-on experience before remote transition
- IT support role at installation where spouse stationed
- Entry-level role to build experience, then pivot to remote

**Recommendation**: Prioritize remote or hybrid-with-remote-option roles. Entry-level may require some on-site, but transition to remote as you gain experience and certifications.
