## Remote vs. On-Site Considerations

### Fully Remote Roles (Most Common for Designers)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintain employment through PCS moves—no job hunting every 2-3 years
- ✅ Access to global job market, not limited by installation location
- ✅ Flexible schedule around military life (deployments, trainings, TDY)
- ✅ No commute—more time for family and professional development
- ✅ Lower expenses (work wardrobe, commuting, childcare)
- ✅ Often better work-life balance

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Requires self-motivation and strong time management
- ❌ Less spontaneous collaboration (can feel isolated)
- ❌ Need reliable internet (critical consideration in military housing)
- ❌ Async communication requires over-documentation
- ❌ Harder to build informal relationships with colleagues

**Remote Success Tips:**
- Set up dedicated workspace with good lighting for video calls
- Over-communicate design decisions in writing (Figma comments, Slack updates)
- Schedule regular video check-ins with team members
- Join virtual design communities to combat isolation
- Establish clear work hours and communicate them to family and team

### Hybrid Roles

**Structure**: 2-3 days in office, rest remote

**Considerations for Military Spouses:**
- ⚠️ Less portable—requires new job search with each PCS
- ⚠️ Office must be near current duty station
- ✅ Better mentorship and collaboration opportunities
- ✅ Easier to build relationships early in career
- ✅ Access to in-person whiteboarding and design sprints

**When Hybrid Makes Sense:**
- You're stationed near a tech hub (Seattle, SF, Austin, NYC, DC)
- Planning to stay at current location for 3+ years
- Entry-level and want in-person mentorship and learning
- Company offers remote flexibility for PCS situations

### On-Site Roles

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Most challenging for military spouse career continuity
- ⚠️ Requires job change with each PCS
- ✅ May offer higher starting salaries in major markets
- ✅ Best for networking and skill development early in career

**When On-Site Might Work:**
- Defense contractor role at your spouse's installation
- Short-term contract to build experience before transitioning to remote
- You're established enough to negotiate remote transition

**Recommendation**: Prioritize fully remote roles for maximum career portability. Remote is now the norm in UX/UI, not the exception.

Using the Google UX Certificate (MyCAA-funded) and free Figma tutorials, she built a portfolio of three case studies over nine months. She landed her first remote UX role at $65,000 with a healthcare startup. Two years and one PCS later, she's a senior product designer earning $95,000.
