## Remote vs. On-Site Considerations

### Fully Remote Roles (90%+ of Technical Writing)

**Why Technical Writing is Highly Remote:**
- Work is output-based (documentation deliverables)
- Collaboration happens via docs, Slack, video calls (not water cooler conversations)
- Tools are cloud-based (Google Docs, Confluence, GitHub)
- Can interview SMEs remotely
- No physical equipment required beyond laptop

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintain employment through every PCS move
- ✅ Access to global job market (companies worldwide hire remote tech writers)
- ✅ Flexible schedule around military family life
- ✅ No commute, lower expenses
- ✅ Work from anywhere with internet
- ✅ Often better work-life balance than on-site roles

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Can feel isolated without team interaction
- ❌ Requires self-motivation and time management
- ❌ May need to coordinate across time zones for meetings with SMEs
- ❌ Harder to build informal relationships
- ❌ Need dedicated workspace and reliable internet

**Remote Success Tips:**
- Set up dedicated workspace with dual monitors (reviewing docs on one, writing on the other)
- Over-communicate via Slack/Teams since you can't tap someone's shoulder
- Schedule regular 1-on-1s with manager and team members
- Use video when possible to build relationships
- Establish clear work hours and protect them
- Join virtual technical writing communities to combat isolation

### Hybrid Roles (Rare in Technical Writing)

**Structure**: 1-2 days in office, rest remote (uncommon for tech writing)

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Less portable—requires job change with each PCS
- ⚠️ Only viable if office near current duty station
- ✅ Easier collaboration with team and SMEs
- ✅ Might help early-career writers learn faster
- ✅ Networking opportunities

**When Hybrid Might Make Sense:**
- Entry-level writer wanting in-person mentorship
- Defense contractor role at installation where spouse stationed
- Expect to stay at location 3+ years
- Company offers remote flexibility for PCS

### On-Site Roles (Very Rare in Modern Technical Writing)

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Extremely challenging for military spouse career continuity
- ⚠️ Mostly legacy positions at older companies
- ⚠️ Requires job change every PCS
- ✅ Might offer higher salaries in tech hubs (SF, Seattle, NYC)
- ✅ Best networking opportunities

**When On-Site Might Work:**
- Short-term contract to build experience before remote transition
- Defense contractor role at spouse's installation
- Major tech hub location with multi-year assignment

**Recommendation**: Prioritize fully remote roles. Technical writing is one of the MOST remote-friendly tech careers—don't settle for on-site or even hybrid unless there's compelling reason.

- Leveraged teaching background (explaining complex concepts, audience awareness)
- Focused on API documentation (highest demand, best pay)
- Taught herself basic programming concepts to understand developer perspective
- Built portfolio documenting real APIs, not hypothetical examples
- Emphasized military spouse status with MSEP companies
