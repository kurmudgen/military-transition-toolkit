## Remote vs. On-Site Considerations

### Fully Remote Roles (Most Common for Data Analysts)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintain career continuity through PCS moves
- ✅ Access to national job market, not limited by installation location
- ✅ Flexible schedule for military family demands
- ✅ No commute time or expenses
- ✅ Can work from anywhere with reliable internet
- ✅ Same work-from-home setup travels with you

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Requires self-discipline and time management
- ❌ Less face-to-face collaboration (more async communication)
- ❌ Need reliable home internet (critical for data work)
- ❌ Can feel isolated without in-person team
- ❌ Harder to build informal relationships

**Remote Success Tips:**
- Set up dedicated workspace with dual monitors (productivity boost for data work)
- Establish clear work hours and communicate them
- Over-communicate via Slack/Teams
- Schedule regular video check-ins with manager and team
- Join virtual data communities to combat isolation
- Invest in quality internet (essential for uploading/downloading large datasets)

### Hybrid Roles

**Structure**: 2-3 days in office, rest remote

**Considerations for Military Spouses:**
- ⚠️ Less portable—requires job change with each PCS
- ⚠️ Office must be commutable from current duty station
- ✅ Better collaboration and mentorship early in career
- ✅ Easier to learn tools and processes in person
- ✅ Networking opportunities

**When Hybrid Makes Sense:**
- Stationed near major city or tech hub
- Expect to stay at current location 3+ years
- Entry-level and want in-person support
- Company offers remote transition option for PCS

### On-Site Roles

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Most challenging for military spouse continuity
- ⚠️ Requires new job search with each PCS
- ✅ May offer higher salaries in major markets (NYC, SF, Seattle)
- ✅ Best networking and learning opportunities

**When On-Site Might Work:**
- Short-term contract to gain experience
- Defense contractor role at spouse's installation
- You're established enough to negotiate remote transition
- Planning civilian career after military separation

**Recommendation**: Prioritize fully remote roles. The data analyst role is highly conducive to remote work, and most companies now offer it.
