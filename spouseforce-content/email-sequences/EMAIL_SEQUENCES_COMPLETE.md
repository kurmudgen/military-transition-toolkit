- Direct employer postings
- Check daily, apply fast → weworkremotely.com

**3. MSEP - Military Spouse Employment Partnership (Free)**
- 500+ employers committed to hiring military spouses
- Filter for remote roles
- Military spouse preference → msepjobs.militaryonesource.mil

**Action for today:**
1. Pick ONE board from above
2. Set up job alert
3. Apply to 3 jobs TODAY

That's it. 30 minutes, 3 applications, better quality than 50 Indeed apps.

You've got this,
[Your Name]

**Preview:** This resume addresses PCS moves head-on and turns them into a strength...

**Body:**

• Managed $150K budget, achieving 35% ROI
• Led team of 5 in successful product launch

3. Showed you delivered value despite short tenure

[First Name],

Meet Sarah.

- Elementary teacher, 6 years

**18 months later:** $78K at same company, PCS'd twice (kept job, just updated address)

*"I wasted 2 years being frustrated before taking action. Don't wait. Pick a portable career, invest 6 months training, and change your life. The PCS cycles don't stop, but YOUR career can finally be stable."*

**What Sarah did, you can too.**

The path:
1. Choose portable career (check our 100 career guides)
2. Get trained (use MyCAA if eligible)
3. Build portfolio
4. Apply to remote roles
