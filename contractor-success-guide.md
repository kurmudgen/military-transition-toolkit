## 1. Welcome to AdaptHome

**[GRAPHIC PLACEHOLDER: AdaptHome logo + hero image of accessible home modification]**

### Thank You for Joining Our Mission

Welcome to AdaptHome, where we're revolutionizing how veterans access adaptive housing modifications. As a beta contractor partner, you're helping us build something truly meaningful—a platform that connects California veterans with qualified, VA-experienced contractors who understand their unique needs.

### Our Story

AdaptHome was founded by Jacob, an active-duty Navy E6 with 19 years of service, currently transitioning to civilian life. Having witnessed firsthand the challenges veterans face when trying to use their VA housing grants, Jacob built AdaptHome through Formation Labs LLC to create a better way.

### Our Mission

We exist to:
- **Simplify the process** for veterans navigating VA housing grants
- **Connect veterans** with contractors who understand their needs
- **Deliver pre-qualified leads** to experienced contractors like you
- **Build trust** through veteran-to-veteran service

### What Makes AdaptHome Different

Unlike lead generation platforms like HomeAdvisor or Thumbtack:
- ✓ **Exclusive leads** - Not shared with 5+ competitors
- ✓ **Pre-qualified veterans** - Grant already approved, serious buyers
- ✓ **Veteran-owned** - Built by veterans, for veterans
- ✓ **Quality over quantity** - Focused on Southern California excellence
- ✓ **Free during beta** - Prove the value before you pay

## 2. How the Platform Works

**[GRAPHIC PLACEHOLDER: Step-by-step flowchart]**

### The Veteran Journey

**Step 1: Veteran Discovery**
- Veteran finds AdaptHome through search, VA resources, or referrals
- Visits adapthome.vet to explore the cost calculator

**Step 2: Cost Calculation**
- Veteran enters their ZIP code, disability type, and needed modifications
- Our calculator provides instant cost estimates based on local data
- System checks if modifications fit within their VA grant limits

**Step 3: Contractor Matching**
- For Southern California veterans: Automatic matching with certified contractors
- For out-of-area veterans: Waitlist signup for future expansion

**Step 4: Lead Delivery**
- You receive lead notification via email and dashboard
- Lead includes: veteran contact info, location, modification needs, grant type, estimated budget

**Step 5: Contractor Response**
- You contact the veteran within 24 hours (best practice)
- Schedule initial consultation
- Provide detailed estimate

**Step 6: Project Completion**
- You complete the adaptive modifications
- Veteran submits feedback through our platform
- Both parties benefit from a successful outcome

### Your Dashboard

**[GRAPHIC PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of contractor dashboard with annotations]**

Your AdaptHome contractor portal provides:

- **Lead management** - Track status of all leads (new, contacted, quoted, won, completed)
- **Calendar integration** - Schedule consultations
- **Document storage** - Upload certifications, insurance, project photos
