    Reposition as comprehensive toolkit + add security transparency page (DOD-compliant)
    
    PART 1: DOD-COMPLIANT REPOSITIONING
    - Landing page: Changed "Built by Veterans, for Veterans" to "Built by someone going through transition"
    - Footer: Updated to "Created by someone going through military transition"
    - FAQ: Removed "active duty" references, changed to "transitioning service members and veterans"
    - FAQ: Added comprehensive toolkit clarification (VA claims is ONE of seven features)
    - About: Complete rewrite emphasizing comprehensive nature
      * Positioned as full transition solution (not just VA claims)
      * Clarified software tool vs filing service (like TurboTax)
      * Emphasized all features: timeline, resume, jobs, calculator, state comparison, VA claims, resources
      * Added value comparison ($4,800-$10,500 vs $49/year)
    
    PART 2: SECURITY TRANSPARENCY PAGE
    - Created new /app/security route with comprehensive security documentation
    - Added Security & Privacy link to Landing page footer
    - Updated App.jsx routing to include Security component
    - Page covers:
      * Data encryption (in transit & at rest)
      * Authentication & access controls
      * Attack prevention (rate limiting, CSRF, input validation)
      * Payment security (Stripe PCI-DSS Level 1)
      * Logging & monitoring (with PHI redaction)
      * Data rights (GDPR-compliant deletion, data portability)
      * Regular security audits
      * Third-party service security (Supabase, Vercel, Stripe)
      * Compliance standards (GDPR, HIPAA-aware)
      * Incident response procedures
