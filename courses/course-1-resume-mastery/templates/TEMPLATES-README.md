## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Can I use multiple templates for different applications?**
A: Yes! You should have 2-3 different resume versions for different industries or types of roles.

**Q: Should I change the template formatting?**
A: Minor changes are fine (colors, spacing), but keep ATS-compatible structure. Don't add graphics, tables, or columns.

**Q: What if my MOS doesn't have a specific template?**
A: Choose the template for your TARGET ROLE, not your military job. A combat medic applying for healthcare operations should use the healthcare template, not try to find a "medic" template.

**Q: How often should I update my resume?**
A: Update every 3 months with new accomplishments, certifications, or training. Always customize for each specific application.

**Q: Can I combine sections from different templates?**
A: Yes, mix and match as needed. For example, you might use the federal "Work Experience" format with the corporate "Core Skills" section.
