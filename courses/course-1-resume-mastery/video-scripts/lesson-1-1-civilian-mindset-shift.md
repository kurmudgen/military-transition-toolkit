### INTRO (0:00-0:45)

**[ON SCREEN: Course title and lesson number]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to Military Resume Mastery. I'm [Instructor Name], and I spent 22 years in the Army before retiring as a Sergeant Major. After I hung up my uniform, I sent out my resume to 35 companies... and got exactly zero responses. Not one phone call. Not one email. Nothing.

**[ON SCREEN: "35 Resumes Sent = 0 Responses"]**

I couldn't understand it. I had led hundreds of soldiers, managed multi-million dollar budgets, and executed complex operations in combat zones. On paper, I was overqualified for most of the jobs I applied for. So what was the problem?

The problem was simple: I was speaking a foreign language to civilian hiring managers. And they couldn't understand a word I was saying.

**[ON SCREEN: Lesson title - "The Civilian Resume Mindset Shift"]**

In this lesson, you're going to learn why military resumes fail, what civilian hiring managers are actually looking for, and how to make the mental shift from military to civilian resume writing. Let's dive in.

### PART 1: WHY MILITARY RESUMES FAIL (0:45-4:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Why Military Resumes Fail with Civilian Hiring Managers"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me show you an actual bullet point from my original military resume. This is what I wrote:

**[ON SCREEN: Bad Example]**
"Served as platoon sergeant for 42-soldier infantry platoon conducting counterinsurgency operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom"

Now, let me ask you - if you were a hiring manager at a logistics company in Ohio who has never served in the military, what does that sentence tell you about my ability to do the job you're hiring for?

**[PAUSE]**

The answer is: absolutely nothing. It tells you I was in the military, and it tells you I was in Afghanistan, but it doesn't tell you ANY skills that translate to your company.

Here's what I should have written:

**[ON SCREEN: Good Example]**
"Managed 42-person team across 6 geographically dispersed locations, coordinating complex logistics operations with $2.3M equipment accountability and zero loss incidents over 12-month period"

See the difference? The second version speaks to:
- Management experience (42 people)
- Geographic complexity (6 locations)
- Logistics capability
- Budget responsibility ($2.3M)
- Results (zero loss)
- Duration (12 months)

That's what civilian hiring managers want to see.

**[ON SCREEN: "Civilian Hiring Managers Don't Speak Military"]**

The first mistake most veterans make is assuming civilian hiring managers understand military terminology, rank structure, and operational context. They don't. And here's the brutal truth: they don't care enough to learn.

The average hiring manager spends 6-7 seconds scanning your resume before deciding whether to keep reading or move to the next candidate. Six seconds. That's it.

**[ON SCREEN: "6-7 seconds to make an impression"]**

If those first six seconds are filled with military jargon like "platoon sergeant," "Operation Enduring Freedom," and "counterinsurgency operations," you've lost them. They don't know what a platoon sergeant does. They don't know the difference between OEF and OIF. And they're certainly not going to Google it.

Your resume goes in the "no" pile, and they move on to the next candidate.

### PART 2: THE TRANSLATION PROBLEM (4:00-7:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "The Translation Problem"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
The core problem with military resumes is what I call "The Translation Problem." You're trying to translate highly specialized military experience into language that civilian hiring managers can understand and value.

Let's look at some common military terms and what they actually mean in civilian context:

**[ON SCREEN: Split screen with Military → Civilian translations]**

**Military:** "Subordinates"
**Civilian:** "Direct reports" or "Team members"

**Military:** "Mission"
**Civilian:** "Project" or "Initiative"

**Military:** "Executed operations"
**Civilian:** "Managed projects" or "Coordinated activities"

**Military:** "Combat zone"
**Civilian:** "High-stress environment" or "Austere conditions"

**Military:** "Chain of command"
**Civilian:** "Reporting structure" or "Management hierarchy"

Every single line of your military resume probably contains 3-5 terms that need translation. And if you don't do that translation work, the hiring manager will simply move on.

**[ON SCREEN: "Before" resume example - heavily military jargon]**

Here's a real example from a Staff Sergeant who came to me for help:

"Squad leader responsible for 12 soldiers conducting mounted and dismounted patrols in hostile fire areas. Maintained 100% accountability of sensitive items including crew-served weapons systems. Prepared and submitted DA Form 2166-9 monthly."

What does any of that mean to a civilian? Nothing.

**[ON SCREEN: "After" resume example - translated to civilian language]**

Here's what we changed it to:

"Team leader managing 12-person security operations unit in high-threat environment. Supervised equipment inventory valued at $850K with zero loss incidents. Completed 30+ performance evaluations ensuring team development and readiness."

Now we're speaking their language: team leader, managing people, high-threat environment (they understand that), equipment inventory with dollar value, zero loss (results!), and performance evaluations (every manager does those).

### PART 3: ATS - THE ROBOT GATEKEEPER (7:30-10:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "ATS: Applicant Tracking Systems"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now here's the part that trips up even veterans who DO translate their experience correctly: the robots.

Most medium and large companies don't have humans reading your resume first. They have software called an Applicant Tracking System - ATS - that scans every resume looking for specific keywords, formatting, and qualifications.

**[ON SCREEN: Graphic showing resume → ATS software → human recruiter]**

If your resume doesn't contain the right keywords, it never reaches a human being. The ATS filters it out automatically.

Let me give you a real example. Let's say you're applying for a "Project Manager" position at a tech company. The job posting says they want someone with:
- Project management experience
- Team leadership
- Budget management
- Risk mitigation
- Stakeholder communication

Your military resume says:
- Platoon leader
- Subordinate development
- Resource allocation
- Threat assessment
- Coalition coordination

**[ON SCREEN: Side-by-side comparison of job posting keywords vs. military terms]**

Do you see the problem? Even though you DID all those things - you managed projects, led teams, handled budgets, mitigated risks, and communicated with stakeholders - your resume doesn't use the exact words the ATS is searching for.

Result? Your resume gets rejected by the software before any human ever sees it.

**[ON SCREEN: "75% of resumes are rejected by ATS"]**

Studies show that 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS software, and military resumes have an even higher rejection rate because of the terminology gap.

The good news? In Lesson 3.1, I'm going to show you exactly how to optimize your resume to beat the ATS. But first, you need to understand that the ATS exists and that you're not just writing for humans - you're writing for robots AND humans.

### PART 4: RESUME TYPES AND LENGTH (10:30-13:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Resume Types: Which One Should You Use?"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let's talk about resume types, because this is another area where military members get confused.

There are three main types of resumes:

**1. Chronological Resume**
**[ON SCREEN: Chronological resume example]**
This lists your work experience in reverse chronological order - most recent job first. This is the most common format and what 90% of civilian employers expect to see.

Use this if: You have a clear career progression and you're staying in a similar field.

**2. Functional Resume**
**[ON SCREEN: Functional resume example]**
This organizes your experience by skill categories rather than by job. For example, "Leadership Experience," "Technical Skills," "Project Management," etc.

Use this if: You're changing careers dramatically, you have employment gaps, or your job titles don't reflect your actual responsibilities.

**3. Hybrid/Combination Resume**
**[ON SCREEN: Hybrid resume example]**
This combines both approaches - a skills summary at the top, followed by chronological work history.

Use this if: You have strong transferable skills but also want to show career progression.

**For most veterans, I recommend the hybrid format.** Here's why: Your military job titles (squad leader, platoon sergeant, operations chief) don't mean anything to civilians, so you need that skills summary up front. But you also want to show that you have a stable work history and career progression.

**[ON SCREEN: "Resume Length: How Long?"]**

Now, let's talk about length. You've probably heard different advice:
- "Never more than one page"
- "Two pages is okay for senior people"
- "Federal resumes should be 5 pages"

Here's the truth:

**Corporate/Private Sector: 1-2 pages maximum**
- E5-E6: Aim for 1 page, maximum 2 if you have 15+ years of relevant experience
- E7-E9: 2 pages is acceptable given your senior leadership experience

**Federal/Government Jobs (USAJobs): 3-5 pages**
- Federal resumes are completely different
- They want MORE detail, not less
- Include everything: exact dates, hours per week, supervisor contact info
- We'll cover federal resume format in Lesson 3.2

**Defense Contractors: 2-3 pages**
- They understand military background better
- Security clearance can be prominently featured
- More technical detail is acceptable

**[ON SCREEN: Resume length recommendations by sector]**

Bottom line: For most civilian jobs, keep it to 2 pages maximum. If you can't fit your experience on 2 pages, you're including too much detail or you're not being selective enough about what's relevant to the job.

### PART 5: THE MINDSET SHIFT (13:00-14:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "The Civilian Resume Mindset Shift"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me summarize the mindset shift you need to make:

**Military Mindset:**
- Your rank and job title explain your experience
- Your resume is a comprehensive record of service
- Military terminology is precise and appropriate
- Your leadership is self-evident from your position

**Civilian Mindset:**
- Your job title means nothing - your accomplishments matter
- Your resume is a marketing document, not a biography
- Civilian language is required - no jargon
- Your leadership must be demonstrated with specific examples and results

**[ON SCREEN: Military vs. Civilian Mindset comparison table]**

Here's the key insight: In the military, your resume is a factual record. In the civilian world, your resume is a sales pitch.

You're not trying to document everything you did. You're trying to convince a hiring manager that you can solve their specific problems and add value to their organization.

That means:
- Being selective about what you include
- Tailoring your resume to each job
- Focusing on results and impact, not just duties
- Using their language, not yours

### CONCLUSION & WORKBOOK EXERCISE (14:30-15:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Your Action Steps"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Alright, let's recap what we covered:

1. Military resumes fail because of the jargon gap
2. You must translate military terminology to civilian language
3. ATS software filters out 75% of resumes - you need to optimize for it
4. Use a hybrid resume format for most civilian jobs
5. Keep it to 1-2 pages for corporate, 3-5 for federal
6. Shift from "record of service" to "marketing document" mindset

Now it's time for your workbook exercise.

**[ON SCREEN: Workbook Exercise 1.1]**

**Your assignment:**

Go to your workbook, pages 1-8, and complete Exercise 1.1: "Resume Audit."

You're going to:
1. Pull out your current military resume
2. Identify every piece of military jargon (circle them in red)
3. Count how many there are
4. Rate your resume on the ATS-friendliness checklist
5. Determine which resume type (chronological, functional, or hybrid) is best for your situation

This exercise will take about 30-45 minutes, but it's crucial. You need to see the problem before you can fix it.

In the next lesson, Lesson 1.2, we're going to dive deep into identifying your transferable skills using the MOS Translation Matrix. This is where we start building your new civilian resume from the ground up.

See you in the next lesson!
