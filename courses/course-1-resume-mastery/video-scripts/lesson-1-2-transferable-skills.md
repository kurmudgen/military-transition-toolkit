### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Lesson title - "Identifying Your Transferable Skills"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome back! In the last lesson, we talked about why military resumes fail and the mindset shift you need to make. Now comes the fun part: discovering just how valuable your military experience actually is in the civilian world.

Here's what most veterans don't realize: You have WAY more transferable skills than you think you do. The problem isn't that you lack skills - it's that you don't know how to identify them and articulate them in civilian terms.

**[ON SCREEN: "You Have More Skills Than You Realize"]**

In this lesson, I'm going to teach you the MOS Translation Matrix, show you how to categorize your skills into three buckets, and help you extract 20 concrete accomplishments from your military service that will form the foundation of your new civilian resume.

Let's get started.

### PART 1: THE MOS TRANSLATION MATRIX (0:30-4:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "The MOS Translation Matrix"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Every Military Occupational Specialty - your MOS, AFSC, Rating, or whatever your branch calls it - has direct civilian equivalents. The problem is that the military doesn't make this connection obvious.

Let me show you what I mean with some examples:

**[ON SCREEN: Army 11B Infantry → Civilian Equivalents]**

**Army 11B - Infantryman**

Most people think: "I was a grunt. I don't have any civilian skills."

Wrong. Here are your civilian transferable skills:
- **Leadership:** Squad leader, team leader, fire team leader
- **Training:** Trained new soldiers on weapons, tactics, and procedures
- **Safety management:** Range safety, risk assessment, safety briefings
- **Logistics:** Equipment maintenance, supply requests, inventory management
- **Operations:** Planning and executing complex missions under pressure
- **Communication:** Radio operations, situation reports, briefings to leadership

**Civilian job matches:**
- Security manager
- Operations supervisor
- Training coordinator
- Safety manager
- Logistics coordinator
- Emergency management specialist

See? An 11B has a dozen transferable skills that map directly to civilian careers.

**[ON SCREEN: Navy CTN - Cryptologic Technician Networks → Civilian Equivalents]**

**Navy CTN - Cryptologic Technician Networks**

Military job: Cybersecurity and network operations

**Transferable skills:**
- Network security monitoring
- Incident response and analysis
- Vulnerability assessment
- Security clearance (huge asset!)
- Technical writing and documentation
- Cross-functional team collaboration

**Civilian job matches:**
- Cybersecurity analyst (avg salary: $95K-$120K)
- Network security engineer
- SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst
- Information security specialist
- Penetration tester
- Threat intelligence analyst

**[ON SCREEN: USMC 0431 - Logistics/Embarkation Specialist → Civilian Equivalents]**

**USMC 0431 - Logistics/Embarkation Specialist**

**Transferable skills:**
- Supply chain management
- Transportation coordination
- Inventory control
- Data management and tracking systems
- Vendor/contractor liaison
- Process improvement

**Civilian job matches:**
- Supply chain analyst
- Logistics coordinator
- Transportation manager
- Warehouse operations manager
- Procurement specialist
- Operations analyst

**[ON SCREEN: "Your MOS Has Civilian Value - You Just Need to Translate It"]**

The pattern here is clear: EVERY military job has civilian equivalents. Your job in this lesson is to identify the specific transferable skills from YOUR MOS and YOUR actual experience.

### PART 2: THREE SKILL CATEGORIES (4:00-7:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Three Categories of Transferable Skills"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now I want you to think about your military experience in three distinct categories: Leadership Skills, Technical Skills, and Soft Skills. Every accomplishment you put on your resume should fall into one of these three buckets.

**[ON SCREEN: Category 1 - Leadership Skills]**

**CATEGORY 1: LEADERSHIP SKILLS**

This is where E5-E9 veterans have a massive advantage over civilian candidates. You've led people in high-stress, high-stakes environments. That's incredibly valuable.

Leadership skills include:
- **People management:** Supervised, trained, and developed subordinates
- **Performance management:** Counseling, evaluations, promotions, corrective action
- **Team building:** Built cohesive teams from diverse backgrounds
- **Decision-making:** Made critical decisions under pressure
- **Mentorship:** Developed junior leaders
- **Conflict resolution:** Mediated disputes, maintained discipline

**Real example - E-7 Army Platoon Sergeant:**

Military bullet:
"Platoon sergeant for 42-soldier infantry platoon"

Civilian translation:
"Managed 42-person team including 4 team leaders, conducting 30+ performance evaluations annually and maintaining 95% retention rate"

See the difference? The second version quantifies your leadership (42 people, 4 direct reports, 30 evaluations) and shows results (95% retention).

**[ON SCREEN: Category 2 - Technical Skills]**

**CATEGORY 2: TECHNICAL SKILLS**

These are the hard skills specific to your MOS or additional training you received.

Examples:
- **IT/Cyber:** Network administration, cybersecurity, programming
- **Medical:** Patient care, emergency medicine, medical records management
- **Maintenance:** Equipment maintenance, diagnostics, repair
- **Intelligence:** Data analysis, reporting, briefing production
- **Communications:** Radio operations, satellite systems, IT infrastructure
- **Aviation:** Aircraft maintenance, flight operations, quality control

**Real example - E-6 Navy IT Specialist:**

Military bullet:
"Managed ship's IT infrastructure"

Civilian translation:
"Administered network infrastructure supporting 300+ users across 15 systems, maintaining 99.8% uptime and zero security incidents over 18-month deployment"

Again: quantify everything (300 users, 15 systems, 18 months) and show results (99.8% uptime, zero incidents).

**[ON SCREEN: Category 3 - Soft Skills]**

**CATEGORY 3: SOFT SKILLS**

These are the transferable skills that apply to almost any job, and they're often what separate good candidates from great ones.

Soft skills include:
- **Communication:** Written and oral communication, briefings, presentations
- **Adaptability:** Thrived in changing environments and ambiguous situations
- **Problem-solving:** Identified issues and implemented solutions
- **Time management:** Managed multiple priorities and deadlines
- **Teamwork:** Collaborated across departments and organizations
- **Work ethic:** Reliability, punctuality, attention to detail

**Real example - E-8 Marine Gunnery Sergeant:**

Military bullet:
"Coordinated with multiple units during deployment"

Civilian translation:
"Collaborated with 8 cross-functional teams across 3 time zones to coordinate complex logistics operations, resulting in 100% on-time delivery of critical supplies"

Notice: specific numbers (8 teams, 3 time zones), action verb (collaborated), and measurable result (100% on-time delivery).

**[ON SCREEN: All three categories side by side]**

The best resumes include a mix of all three categories. You want to show:
- Leadership: You can manage people and projects
- Technical: You have specific hard skills relevant to the job
- Soft Skills: You have the intangibles that make someone successful

### PART 3: QUANTIFYING MILITARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS (7:30-11:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Finding the Numbers in Your Military Experience"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's a secret that will transform your resume: civilian hiring managers LOVE numbers. Numbers make your accomplishments concrete, measurable, and believable.

Every bullet point on your resume should include at least one number. Ideally two or three.

Let me show you how to find the numbers hiding in your military experience:

**[ON SCREEN: Budget Responsibility]**

**BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY**

You managed equipment, right? That equipment has a dollar value.

Questions to ask yourself:
- What was the total value of equipment you were responsible for?
- What was your unit's annual budget?
- What was the value of contracts you managed or oversaw?
- How much money did your process improvement save?

Examples:
- "Managed equipment inventory valued at $2.3M with zero loss"
- "Oversaw $450K annual training budget for 120-person unit"
- "Negotiated contracts with local vendors saving $75K annually"

**[ON SCREEN: Team Size and Span of Control]**

**TEAM SIZE AND SPAN OF CONTROL**

How many people did you lead, supervise, or work with?

Questions to ask yourself:
- How many direct reports did you have?
- How many total people in your unit/section/platoon?
- How many people did you train?
- How many subordinate leaders reported to you?

Examples:
- "Led 12-person team including 3 team leaders"
- "Trained 450+ personnel on safety procedures over 3-year period"
- "Supervised 4 squad leaders managing 38 total personnel"

**[ON SCREEN: Time Saved / Efficiency Improved]**

**TIME SAVED / EFFICIENCY IMPROVED**

Did you streamline a process, reduce wait times, or improve efficiency?

Questions to ask yourself:
- How much time did your improvement save (per day, per week, per process)?
- What was the efficiency gain (percentage improvement)?
- How many man-hours did you eliminate?

Examples:
- "Streamlined supply request process, reducing approval time from 5 days to 2 days (60% improvement)"
- "Automated reporting process, saving 15 hours per week of manual data entry"
- "Reduced equipment maintenance downtime by 30% through preventive maintenance program"

**[ON SCREEN: Volume of Work]**

**VOLUME OF WORK**

How much work did you handle? How many events, requests, operations?

Questions to ask yourself:
- How many operations/missions/events did you execute?
- How many requests/orders/reports did you process?
- How many customers/patients/personnel did you support?

Examples:
- "Coordinated 47 convoys moving 230+ personnel and $8M in equipment with zero incidents"
- "Processed 1,200+ supply requests monthly with 98% accuracy rate"
- "Provided medical care to 850+ patients during 9-month deployment"

**[ON SCREEN: Results and Impact]**

**RESULTS AND IMPACT**

What was the outcome of your work? What improved because of you?

Questions to ask yourself:
- What percentage improvement did you achieve?
- What rating did your unit receive (if applicable)?
- What awards or recognition did you/your unit receive?
- What was prevented (incidents, losses, safety issues)?

Examples:
- "Achieved 'Excellent' rating on all 4 inspections during tenure"
- "Maintained zero safety incidents over 2,400 flight hours"
- "Improved unit readiness from 85% to 97% in 6 months"

### PART 4: THE STAR METHOD FOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE (11:00-13:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "The STAR Method"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now I want to teach you a framework that will help you structure your accomplishments: the STAR method.

STAR stands for:
- **S**ituation
- **T**ask
- **A**ction
- **R**esult

**[ON SCREEN: STAR acronym breakdown]**

This method helps you tell a complete story in one or two sentences.

Let me show you how it works:

**Example 1: Logistics Problem**

**Situation:** Supply chain was broken during deployment
**Task:** Needed to get critical parts faster
**Action:** Established direct relationship with vendor, bypassing normal channels
**Result:** Reduced delivery time from 14 days to 3 days

**STAR Resume Bullet:**
"Established direct vendor relationships to streamline supply chain, reducing critical parts delivery time by 79% (from 14 to 3 days) during 12-month deployment"

**[ON SCREEN: Example 2]**

**Example 2: Training Challenge**

**Situation:** New equipment arrived with no training program
**Task:** Create comprehensive training for 60 personnel
**Action:** Developed 40-hour training curriculum with hands-on practical exercises
**Result:** 100% certification rate on first attempt

**STAR Resume Bullet:**
"Developed and delivered 40-hour training program for new equipment system, certifying 60 personnel with 100% first-time pass rate"

**[ON SCREEN: Example 3]**

**Example 3: Leadership Challenge**

**Situation:** Took over section with low morale and high turnover
**Task:** Improve retention and performance
**Action:** Implemented mentorship program and monthly professional development sessions
**Result:** Retention improved from 60% to 92% over 18 months

**STAR Resume Bullet:**
"Rebuilt team culture through mentorship program and professional development initiatives, improving retention from 60% to 92% over 18-month period"

**[ON SCREEN: STAR formula]**

The STAR formula is: Action + Numbers + Result

Every resume bullet should include:
1. A strong action verb (Action)
2. Specific numbers (quantification)
3. The measurable outcome (Result)

### PART 5: COMMON MISTAKES E5-E9 MAKE (13:30-14:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Common Mistakes to Avoid"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Before we wrap up, let me show you the most common mistakes I see E5-E9 veterans make when identifying transferable skills:

**Mistake #1: Listing duties instead of accomplishments**

❌ Wrong: "Responsible for equipment maintenance"
✅ Right: "Maintained $1.2M equipment inventory with 98% operational readiness rate, exceeding unit standard by 12%"

**Mistake #2: Forgetting to quantify leadership**

❌ Wrong: "Led soldiers"
✅ Right: "Led 15-person team including 3 team leaders across 2-year period, conducting 45 performance evaluations and developing 2 soldiers promoted to E-6"

**Mistake #3: Using rank/position as a substitute for accomplishment**

❌ Wrong: "Served as Company First Sergeant"
✅ Right: "Senior enlisted leader managing 120 personnel across 4 platoons, with responsibility for $15M equipment, training, and readiness"

**Mistake #4: Assuming technical skills are obvious**

❌ Wrong: "Performed maintenance"
✅ Right: "Diagnosed and repaired electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical systems on 12 vehicle platforms, completing 300+ work orders with 95% first-time fix rate"

**Mistake #5: Not connecting military skills to civilian jobs**

❌ Wrong: "Squad leader in infantry platoon"
✅ Right: "Operations team leader managing 9 personnel in high-stress environment, demonstrating crisis management, decision-making, and team coordination skills applicable to emergency management and security operations"

**[ON SCREEN: List of all 5 mistakes]**

See the pattern? Specificity, quantification, and civilian translation.
