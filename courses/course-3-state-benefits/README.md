## Student Success Stories

### Master Sergeant (Ret.) James Anderson
*Moved from California to Texas*

> "This course showed me I was paying $8,000/year in state taxes I didn't need to pay. I moved from California to Texas, bought a bigger house for less money, and I'm saving $650/month. That's $7,800/year for the rest of my life. Best $197 I ever spent."

### Senior Chief (Ret.) Maria Rodriguez
*Chose Tennessee over Virginia*

> "I was planning to retire in Virginia until I took this course. Tennessee has no income tax, lower cost of living, and better property tax exemptions for my disability rating. I'm saving $400/month compared to what I would have paid in Virginia."

### Sergeant Major (Ret.) Robert Lee
*Discovered South Dakota's benefits*

> "I never would have considered South Dakota, but this course opened my eyes. Zero income tax, no property tax for 100% disabled vets, and much lower cost of living. I bought a beautiful home for $200K that would cost $600K in Colorado where I was stationed."

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I really save that much money by choosing a different state?**
A: Yes. The difference between high-tax and no-tax states can be $5,000-$10,000 per year for retirees, which compounds to $150K-$300K over 30 years.

**Q: What if I have family in a specific state?**
A: This course helps you make an informed decision. If family is your top priority, you'll at least know the financial tradeoff you're making.

**Q: Do I have to move immediately after retirement?**
A: No. But the sooner you establish residency in a favorable state, the sooner you start saving on taxes.

**Q: What about states with no income tax but high property taxes?**
A: The course compares total tax burden, not just income tax. Some no-income-tax states have higher property taxes, but the net result is usually still favorable for retirees.

**Q: Can I use my GI Bill anywhere?**
A: Yes, the Post-9/11 GI Bill is federal and works in all states. But some states offer additional education benefits that stack on top of the GI Bill.

**Q: How often is state benefit information updated?**
A: The course is updated quarterly with any legislative changes. You get lifetime access to all updates.
