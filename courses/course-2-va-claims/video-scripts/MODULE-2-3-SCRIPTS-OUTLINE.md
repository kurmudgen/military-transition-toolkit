- Squad/platoon members who witnessed events
- Supervisors and leaders
- Spouses and family members (for ongoing symptoms)
- Friends who knew you before/after service
- What credentials matter vs don't matter

**PART 3: What Makes a Strong Buddy Statement** (4 min)
- Specific vs vague statements (examples)
- First-hand knowledge vs hearsay
- Date, time, location details
- Description of what they witnessed
- How your condition affected you then and now
- Competency statement

**Example Strong Statement:**
"I served with SGT Smith in 2nd Platoon, B Company, 1-504 PIR from June 2014 to May 2016. On March 15, 2015, during a convoy in Helmand Province, our MRAP hit an IED. SGT Smith was in the front passenger seat and I saw him hit his head on the vehicle door frame. He was dazed and confused for several minutes afterward. Since that incident, I noticed he frequently complained of headaches and seemed more forgetful than before..."

**PART 4: Lay Statements (Your Own Statement)** (3 min)

## LESSON 3.3: Secondary and Increase Claims

**Duration:** 15 minutes | **Module:** 3 - Filing Strategy

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand secondary service connection
- Identify potential secondary conditions
- File increase claims when conditions worsen
- Know common secondary chains
- Maximize rating through secondary claims

### Content Outline:

**INTRO:** The easiest way to increase your rating is often through secondary conditions. Every primary condition can cause secondary conditions.

**PART 1: What Is Secondary Service Connection?** (2 min)
- Condition caused by already service-connected condition
- Condition aggravated by service-connected condition
- Doesn't have to be direct physical connection
- Medication side effects count as secondary

**PART 2: Most Common Secondary Conditions** (4 min)
- **Sleep apnea secondary to PTSD** (huge - often 50% rating)
- **Depression/anxiety secondary to chronic pain**
- **Knee/hip problems secondary to back disability** (altered gait)
- **Erectile dysfunction secondary to PTSD or medications**
- **GERD secondary to PTSD medications**
- **Diabetes secondary to PTSD medications** (antipsychotics)
- **Hypertension secondary to sleep apnea**
- **Migraines secondary to TBI**
- **Radiculopathy secondary to spine conditions**

**PART 3: Proving Secondary Connection** (3 min)
- Primary condition must already be service-connected
- Current diagnosis of secondary condition
- Nexus letter showing causation
- Medical literature supporting connection
- Treatment records showing relationship

**Example Secondary Chain:**
1. Service-connected: PTSD at 70%
2. Secondary: Sleep apnea (PTSD causes hypervigilance affecting sleep) at 50%
3. Secondary: Hypertension (sleep apnea causes high blood pressure) at 10-20%
4. Combined: 70% + 50% + 20% = 88% (rounds to 90%)

**PART 4: Increase Claims** (3 min)
- When to file increase: Condition has worsened since last rating
- Evidence needed: Recent treatment, new symptoms, functional loss
- Don't file too early (need to show progression)
- Protected rating vs non-protected
- Risk of reduction (rare but possible)

**PART 5: Strategic Claiming** (2 min)
- File all secondary conditions simultaneously when possible
- Don't wait for primary to be approved (can file simultaneously)
- Consider cumulative impact of secondary conditions
- Medical nexus letter is critical for secondary claims

**PART 6: Common Mistakes** (1 min)
- Not researching potential secondary conditions
- Waiting too long to file secondaries
- Not getting nexus letters for secondary connection
- Filing increase without evidence of worsening

**CONCLUSION:** Every 10% increase means $2,500-$10,000 more per year. Secondary conditions are often easier to prove than primary.

### Workbook Exercise 3.3 (Pages 81-92):
- Map all potential secondary conditions for each primary
- Research medical literature supporting connections
- Identify which secondaries need nexus letters
- Calculate potential rating increase with secondaries
- Create filing timeline for secondary claims

### Content Outline:

**INTRO:** The VA appeals process changed in 2019 (AMA - Appeals Modernization Act). Three lanes, different strategies.

**PART 1: The Three Appeal Lanes** (4 min)

**Lane 1: Supplemental Claim**
- Add new and relevant evidence
- Fastest path (few months)
- Best when: You have new medical evidence, nexus letter, or records
- VA re-adjudicates entire claim
- Success rate: ~30-40% if new evidence is strong

**Lane 2: Higher-Level Review**
- Senior reviewer looks at same evidence
- No new evidence allowed
- Best when: VA made clear error in evaluating existing evidence
- Timeline: 4-5 months average
- Success rate: ~15-20% (low because no new evidence)

**Lane 3: Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)**
- Appeal to Veterans Law Judge
- Can add new evidence (Evidence submission lane)
- Can request hearing
- Timeline: 12-24+ months
- Success rate: ~30-35% overall
- Three dockets: Direct review, Evidence submission, Hearing

**PART 2: Choosing Your Appeal Lane** (3 min)

**PART 6: VSO vs Attorney** (1 min)
- VSO: Free, good for standard claims
- Attorney: Paid (contingency usually 20-33%), for complex appeals
- When you need legal representation
- VA-accredited representatives

**CONCLUSION:** Most successful appeals are supplemental claims with new medical evidence. That's usually your best path.

### Workbook Exercise 4.2 (Pages 103-114):
- If you have a denial, determine which appeal lane to use
- Identify what new evidence you could submit
- Create supplemental claim strategy
- Research VSOs in your area

## LESSON 4.3: Getting to 100%

**Duration:** 15 minutes | **Module:** 4 - Advanced Tactics

### Learning Objectives:
- Create strategic path from current rating to 100%
- Understand TDIU as alternative to 100% scheduler
- Calculate combined ratings needed
- Identify "paths to 100" based on condition
- Know when 100% P&T is achievable vs unrealistic

### Content Outline:

**INTRO:** Getting to 100% is the goal for many veterans. Here's the realistic path to get there.

**PART 1: Two Ways to 100%** (2 min)
- **100% Scheduler:** Combined rating of 100% (or 95% rounded up)
- **TDIU:** Unemployable due to service-connected disabilities
- Monthly pay is the same
- Benefits differ slightly (P&T status, eligibility for certain programs)

**PART 2: Path to 100% Scheduler** (4 min)
- Starting from common ratings and mapping path:
  - From 70%: Need 85% more to reach 95% (rounds to 100%)
  - From 80%: Need 75% more to reach 95%
  - From 90%: Need 50% more to reach 95%
- Secondary conditions often bridge gap
- Increase claims for worsening conditions
- Combined ratings math matters

**Example Path:**
- Current: 70% PTSD + 40% back = 82% (rounds to 80%)
- Add: 50% sleep apnea (secondary to PTSD) = 91% → **90%**
- Add: 20% hypertension (secondary to sleep apnea) = 93% → **90%**
- Add: 10% tinnitus = 93% → **90%**
- Increase: PTSD from 70% to 100% = 100% → **100%!**

**PART 3: TDIU - The Easier Path** (4 min)
- Eligibility: 70%+ with one condition at 60%, OR 70%+ total with one at 40%
- Unemployability criteria
- Substantially gainful employment defined (<poverty level wages)
- Evidence needed:
  - Employer statements
  - Medical opinions on employability
  - Vocational expert opinions
  - Your statement on work attempts
- Success rate: ~40-50% if well-documented

**Real Example:**
Veteran with 70% PTSD + 40% back (82% combined, rounds to 80%)
- Can't maintain employment due to PTSD symptoms
- Tried 3 jobs in 2 years, fired from all due to symptoms
- Doctor states PTSD makes employment impossible
- Applied for TDIU → Approved
- Now receives $3,737.85/month (100% rate) with 80% scheduler rating

**PART 4: 100% Permanent & Total (P&T)** (2 min)
- What P&T means
- Benefits of P&T status:
  - CHAMPVA for family
  - No future C&P exams
  - State benefits eligibility
  - Protected from reduction
- How to get P&T designation
- Age and time factors (protected ratings after 20 years)

**PART 5: Realistic vs Unrealistic Goals** (2 min)
- Not everyone can or should get to 100%
- Focus on accurate rating for actual conditions
- Don't exaggerate or fake symptoms
- Ethics and fraud consequences
- When 70-90% is the right rating

**PART 6: Strategic Planning** (1 min)
- Map your path to 100% or TDIU
- Identify which is more realistic for you
- Timeline (often 2-5 years to go from 50% to 100%)
- Patience and persistence required

**CONCLUSION:** 100% is achievable for many veterans through strategic claiming, increases, and secondaries. TDIU is often the faster path.

### Workbook Exercise 4.3 (Pages 115-126):
- Calculate your current combined rating
- Map potential path to 95%+ (100% rounded)
- Identify potential secondary conditions to claim
- Assess TDIU eligibility and likelihood
- Create 2-3 year strategic plan to maximize rating
