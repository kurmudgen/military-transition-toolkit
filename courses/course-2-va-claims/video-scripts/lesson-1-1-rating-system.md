**[ON SCREEN: Course title - VA Claims Success System / Lesson 1.1]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to VA Claims Success System! I'm [Instructor Name], a VA-accredited Veterans Service Officer who has helped over 1,000 veterans successfully file disability claims. I'm also a 100% disabled veteran myself, so I've been through this process from both sides.

**[ON SCREEN: "The VA Disability Rating System Is Not What You Think"]**

Before we dive into filing claims and gathering evidence, you need to understand the foundation: how the VA rating system actually works. Because here's the truth - it's not intuitive, it's not straightforward, and if you don't understand it, you'll leave benefits on the table.

In this lesson, I'm going to show you exactly how VA disability percentages work, how combined ratings are calculated, and why understanding this system is critical to maximizing your benefits.

Let's get started.

### PART 1: VA DISABILITY RATINGS EXPLAINED (0:30-3:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "What Is a VA Disability Rating?"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
A VA disability rating is a percentage assigned to each service-connected condition that represents how much that condition affects your ability to work and function in daily life.

Ratings are assigned in **10% increments**: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%.

**[ON SCREEN: Rating scale 0% to 100%]**

But here's what most veterans don't understand: **each condition gets its own separate rating**, and then those ratings are **combined** using VA math - which doesn't work like normal math.

Let me show you what I mean.

**[ON SCREEN: Example - Single condition]**

**EXAMPLE 1: SINGLE CONDITION**

Let's say you have knee pain from a parachute injury. The VA evaluates your knee and determines it's 30% disabling. Straightforward.

Your disability rating: **30%**
Your monthly compensation (2025 rate, no dependents): **$524.31/month**

**[ON SCREEN: Example - Multiple conditions]**

**EXAMPLE 2: MULTIPLE CONDITIONS**

Now let's say you have:
- Knee injury: 30%
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears): 10%
- Lower back pain: 20%

Most veterans think: 30% + 10% + 20% = 60% total rating, right?

**Wrong.**

Your actual combined rating using VA math: **50%**

**[ON SCREEN: "VA Math ≠ Regular Math"]**

Wait, how did 30 + 10 + 20 become 50 instead of 60?

This is where it gets interesting. The VA uses something called "**combined ratings table**" based on an efficiency rating system.

Here's the concept: The VA doesn't add disabilities. Instead, they assume you start at 100% efficient (healthy). Each disability reduces your efficiency, and they compound from there.

**[ON SCREEN: Efficiency calculation visual]**

Let me break down that example:

You start at 100% efficient.

**First condition (30% knee):**
- 30% of 100 = 30% reduction
- You're now 70% efficient

**Second condition (20% back):**
- The VA applies this to your remaining efficiency
- 20% of 70 = 14% reduction
- You're now 56% efficient (100 - 30 - 14)

**Third condition (10% tinnitus):**
- 10% of 56 = 5.6% reduction
- You're now 50.4% efficient

**Final calculation:**
- 100% - 50.4% = 49.6% disabled
- VA rounds to nearest 10%
- **Final rating: 50%**

**[ON SCREEN: "Combined Ratings Table - This is how it actually works"]**

The VA publishes a combined ratings table that does this math for you. It's in Title 38 CFR § 4.25.

---

### PART 2: COMBINED RATINGS TABLE (3:30-6:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Use the Combined Ratings Table"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me show you how to actually calculate your combined rating using the official table.

**STEP 1: List all your service-connected conditions from highest to lowest percentage**

Example:
1. PTSD: 70%
2. Lower back: 40%
3. Knee: 20%
4. Tinnitus: 10%

**STEP 2: Start with the two highest ratings**

Use the combined ratings table to find where they intersect.

**[ON SCREEN: Table showing 70% row and 40% column]**

70% combined with 40% = **82%**

**STEP 3: Take that result and combine it with the next rating**

82% combined with 20% = **86%**

**STEP 4: Continue until all ratings are combined**

86% combined with 10% = **87%**

**STEP 5: Round to the nearest 10%**

87% rounds down to **85%** (VA rounds 1-4 down, 5-9 up)

**[ON SCREEN: "Final combined rating: 85%"]**

So even though you have 70% + 40% + 20% + 10% = 140% if you just added them, your actual combined rating is **85%**.

**[ON SCREEN: Common combined rating examples]**

Let me show you some common scenarios:

**Example A:**
- 50% + 30% = **65%**

**Example B:**
- 60% + 50% + 30% = **87%** (rounds to 90%)

**Example C:**
- 40% + 40% + 20% + 10% = **74%** (rounds to 70%)

**Example D:**
- 70% + 70% = **91%** (rounds to 90%)

**[ON SCREEN: "The Rounding Rule Can Make or Break Your Benefits"]**

Notice Example B: 87% rounds UP to 90%.

And Example C: 74% rounds DOWN to 70%.

That rounding can be worth **hundreds of dollars per month**.

At 70%, you get $1,716.28/month.
At 90%, you get $2,241.91/month.

That's a **$525.63/month difference** - or **$6,307.56 per year** - just because of rounding!

### PART 3: BILATERAL FACTOR (6:30-9:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "The Bilateral Factor - Extra Compensation for Paired Body Parts"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Here's something many veterans and even some VSOs don't fully understand: the bilateral factor.

If you have disabilities in **both legs, both arms, or paired body parts**, the VA gives you a slight increase in your combined rating.

**What qualifies as bilateral:**
- Both legs (knees, ankles, hips)
- Both arms (shoulders, elbows, wrists)
- Both eyes
- Both ears (not for tinnitus, but for hearing loss)

**How it works:**

Let's say you have:
- Right knee: 20%
- Left knee: 10%

**Without bilateral factor:**
20% + 10% = **28%** (rounds to 30%)

**With bilateral factor (correct calculation):**

STEP 1: Combine the two ratings normally: 28%
STEP 2: Apply 10% bilateral factor: 28 × 0.10 = 2.8
STEP 3: Add the bilateral factor: 28 + 2.8 = 30.8
STEP 4: Round: **31%** (rounds to 30%)

**[ON SCREEN: "Small difference, but it matters at higher ratings"]**

In this example, it doesn't change the final rating, but at higher percentages, the bilateral factor can push you over a rounding threshold.

**Example with higher ratings:**

- Right knee: 30%
- Left knee: 20%
- Right ankle: 10%
- Left ankle: 10%

**Without bilateral:**
Combined = 55% (rounds to 60%)

**With bilateral:**
Combined with bilateral factor = 59% (still rounds to 60%, but you're closer to the next threshold)

**[ON SCREEN: "Always claim bilateral if you have paired disabilities"]**

The key takeaway: If you have disabilities in both legs or both arms, make sure the VA applies the bilateral factor. Some raters forget this, and you lose out.

### PART 4: TDIU - TOTAL DISABILITY INDIVIDUAL UNEMPLOYABILITY (9:00-11:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "TDIU: Getting 100% Pay Without 100% Rating"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Now let me tell you about one of the most important but underused benefits in the VA system: **TDIU** - Total Disability Individual Unemployability.

**What is TDIU?**

TDIU allows you to receive 100% disability compensation even if your combined rating is less than 100%, if your service-connected disabilities prevent you from maintaining substantially gainful employment.

**[ON SCREEN: TDIU eligibility requirements]**

**TDIU ELIGIBILITY:**

You can get TDIU if:

**Option 1 (Scheduler TDIU):**
- One condition rated at 60% or higher, OR
- Two or more conditions with combined rating of 70% or higher, with at least one condition at 40%

**Option 2 (Extra-scheduler TDIU):**
- You don't meet the percentage requirements above, but your disabilities still prevent you from working
- Requires special justification and medical evidence

**[ON SCREEN: Real example]**

**REAL EXAMPLE:**

Veteran has:
- PTSD: 70%
- Back injury: 40%
- Combined rating: **82%** (rounds to 80%)

At 80%, monthly pay: $1,933.15

But this veteran can't hold a job due to PTSD symptoms and chronic back pain. He applies for TDIU.

**With TDIU approved:**
- Still rated at 80% for disability purposes
- But receives 100% compensation: **$3,737.85/month**

**That's a $1,804.70/month increase** - or $21,656.40 per year!

**[ON SCREEN: "TDIU Requirements"]**

**To qualify for TDIU, you must show:**

1. Your service-connected disabilities prevent you from maintaining substantially gainful employment
2. You're unemployed or working at poverty-level wages (2025: less than $14,000/year)
3. Your unemployment is due to service-connected conditions, not age, education, or other factors

**You do NOT need to:**
- Be bedridden
- Be completely unable to work
- Have 100% scheduler rating

**[ON SCREEN: "TDIU is one of the most powerful tools for veterans"]**

Many veterans at 70-90% combined ratings qualify for TDIU but never apply because they don't know about it. We'll cover this in detail in Lesson 4.3.

### PART 5: PAYMENT RATES AND DEPENDENT INCREASES (11:30-13:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "2025 VA Disability Compensation Rates"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let me show you what each rating percentage actually pays, because the jumps between ratings can be significant.

**[ON SCREEN: Payment rate table - no dependents]**

**2025 MONTHLY RATES (Veteran with no dependents):**

- 10%: $171.23
- 20%: $338.49
- 30%: $524.31
- 40%: $755.28
- 50%: $1,075.16
- 60%: $1,361.88
- 70%: $1,716.28
- 80%: $1,933.15
- 90%: $2,241.91
- 100%: $3,737.85

**[ON SCREEN: "Notice the big jumps"]**

Look at the difference between:
- 60% to 70%: **$354.40/month** ($4,252.80/year)
- 70% to 80%: **$216.87/month** ($2,604.44/year)
- 80% to 90%: **$308.76/month** ($3,705.12/year)
- 90% to 100%: **$1,495.94/month** ($17,951.28/year!)

This is why understanding how to maximize your rating matters so much.

**[ON SCREEN: "Additional compensation for dependents"]**

**DEPENDENT INCREASES:**

If you're rated at 30% or higher, you get additional monthly compensation for:

**At 30% rating:**
- Spouse: +$57/month
- Each child: +$24/month
- Dependent parent: +$41/month

**At 100% rating:**
- Spouse: +$178.76/month
- Each child under 18: +$95.36/month
- Each child 18-23 in school: +$310.75/month
- Dependent parent: +$143/month
- Spouse needing aid & attendance: +$178.77/month additional

**[ON SCREEN: Example family calculation]**

**EXAMPLE: 100% disabled veteran with spouse and 2 kids**

- Base 100% rate: $3,737.85
- Spouse: +$178.76
- Child 1 (age 16): +$95.36
- Child 2 (age 20, in college): +$310.75
- **TOTAL: $4,322.72/month** ($51,872.64/year, tax-free!)

### PART 6: SPECIAL MONTHLY COMPENSATION (SMC) (13:30-14:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "SMC: Extra Pay for Specific Severe Disabilities"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
There's one more type of compensation you need to know about: **Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)**.

SMC provides additional monthly payments for specific severe disabilities beyond the 100% rating.

**[ON SCREEN: Common SMC conditions]**

**SMC is for:**
- Loss of use of extremities (hand, foot, leg, arm)
- Loss of eyesight (blind in one or both eyes)
- Permanent need for aid and attendance (can't perform daily activities alone)
- Permanent bedridden status
- Loss of reproductive organs
- Loss of paired organs

**SMC LEVELS:**

SMC ranges from **SMC-K** (lowest) to **SMC-R** (highest).

**SMC-K:** Loss of use of one hand or foot
- Additional: **$132.75/month** on top of your regular rating

**SMC-L:** Loss of use of both feet, both hands, or one of each
- Additional: **$4,158.34/month** (this is on TOP of 100% rating)

**SMC-R:** Highest level, for veterans requiring constant care
- **$9,106.66/month** total

**[ON SCREEN: Real example]**

**Example:**
Veteran is 100% disabled with loss of use of right hand and left foot.

- 100% base: $3,737.85
- SMC-L (both extremities): +$4,158.34
- **TOTAL: $7,896.19/month** ($94,754.28/year!)

SMC is incredibly valuable but often overlooked. We'll discuss this more in Lesson 4.4.

### CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS (14:30-15:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Key Takeaways - VA Rating System"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Let's recap what you learned about the VA rating system:

1. **VA math doesn't work like regular math** - combined ratings use an efficiency formula
2. **Rounding matters** - 85% rounds to 90%, 84% rounds to 80% - huge difference
3. **Bilateral factor** - Extra credit for paired body part disabilities
4. **TDIU** - Get 100% pay at 70-90% if unemployable
5. **Dependents increase pay** - Significantly more at higher ratings
6. **SMC** - Extra compensation for severe specific disabilities

**[ON SCREEN: Workbook Exercise 1.1]**

**Your assignment:**

Go to your workbook, pages 1-10, and complete Exercise 1.1: "Calculate Your Potential Rating."

You're going to:
1. List all your potential service-connected conditions
2. Research the typical rating percentage for each condition
3. Use the combined ratings table to calculate your potential rating
4. Identify if you might qualify for bilateral factor or TDIU
5. Calculate your potential monthly compensation

This exercise will take 30-45 minutes. Use the combined ratings calculator tool in your bonus materials.

In the next lesson, Lesson 1.2, we're going to cover the three elements required to establish service connection for any condition: current diagnosis, in-service event, and nexus.

Understanding ratings is step one. Understanding service connection is step two. Let's keep going!
