## VIDEO SCRIPT

### INTRO (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Module 2 - Evidence Gathering / Lesson 2.1]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Welcome to Module 2! You now understand how VA ratings work and what's required for service connection. Now comes the detective work: finding and using evidence to prove your claims.

**[ON SCREEN: "Your Service Treatment Records Are GOLD"]**

Your military medical records - officially called Service Treatment Records or STRs - are the single most important piece of evidence in your VA claim. They're the official government documentation of everything medical that happened during your service.

In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to get your complete records, how to read them like a VA rater, and how to find the "magic words" that can make or break your claim.

Let's mine that gold.

### PART 1: WHAT ARE SERVICE TREATMENT RECORDS? (0:30-2:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "Service Treatment Records (STRs) Explained"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Service Treatment Records are the official medical records created during your military service. They include:

**[ON SCREEN: What's in STRs]**

**WHAT'S INCLUDED:**
- Entrance/separation physicals
- Sick call visits
- Emergency room visits
- Hospital admissions
- Mental health appointments
- Physical therapy sessions
- Prescriptions and medications
- Lab results and X-rays
- Dental records
- Immunization records
- Physical fitness test failures due to medical
- Profiles and duty limitations
- Line of duty investigations
- Medevac reports

**[ON SCREEN: What's NOT included]**

**WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED:**
- Unit records or personnel files
- Deployment orders
- Awards and decorations
- Performance evaluations
- Command investigations (unless medical component)

**[ON SCREEN: Why STRs matter so much]**

**WHY STRARE SO CRITICAL:**

1. **Official government records** - Can't be disputed as hearsay
2. **Contemporaneous documentation** - Created at the time events happened
3. **Prove in-service event** - Documents when and what happened
4. **Establish continuity** - Shows ongoing treatment
5. **Diagnoses and symptoms** - Medical professional documentation
6. **Often contain "magic words"** - Specific phrases VA looks for

The VA gives your STRs more weight than almost any other evidence except current medical exams.

### PART 2: HOW TO GET YOUR COMPLETE RECORDS (2:30-5:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Request Your STRs"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Many veterans think they have their complete records, but they're missing critical pages. Let me show you how to get EVERYTHING.

**[ON SCREEN: Three ways to request STRs]**

**METHOD 1: ONLINE VIA VA.GOV (FASTEST)**

1. Go to VA.gov
2. Sign in with ID.me, Login.gov, DS Logon, or My HealtheVet
3. Go to "Records" → "Download VA Medical Records"
4. Request "VA Blue Button Report" (includes VA records)
5. For military records, also file eVetRecs request

**Timeline:** 3-10 business days for VA records

**[ON SCREEN: Method 2]**

**METHOD 2: NATIONAL PERSONNEL RECORDS CENTER**

For complete military records:

1. Go to archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records
2. File Standard Form 180 (SF-180)
3. Or use eVetRecs online system
4. Specifically request "Complete Service Treatment Records"

**Mail to:**
National Personnel Records Center
1 Archives Drive
St. Louis, MO 63138

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (sometimes longer for older records)

**[ON SCREEN: Method 3]**

**METHOD 3: THROUGH YOUR VSO**

Veterans Service Organizations can request records on your behalf through VA systems.

**Advantage:** They know what to request and how to get complete files
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks typically

**[ON SCREEN: CRITICAL ADVICE]**

**CRITICAL: Request COMPLETE records**

When you request your records, specifically state:

"Please provide my COMPLETE Service Treatment Records, including:
- All inpatient and outpatient records
- All active duty treatment
- All deployment medical records
- All mental health records
- All physical therapy records
- All emergency room visits
- All line of duty investigations
- Complete pharmacy/medication history"

Many veterans get partial records because they didn't request everything specifically.

**[ON SCREEN: Get records EARLY]**

**TIMING ADVICE:**

Request your records at least **6-12 months before you plan to file your claim.**

Why?
- Gives you time to review and find all evidence
- Identify gaps that need buddy statements
- Get nexus letters based on what records show
- Order from multiple sources if needed
- File corrections if records are wrong

**Don't wait until you're ready to file to request records.**

### PART 3: HOW TO READ YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS (5:00-8:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Read STRs Like a VA Rater"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Your service treatment records can be hundreds or thousands of pages. You need to know how to read them efficiently and identify the important information.

**[ON SCREEN: Medical record structure]**

**MEDICAL NOTE STRUCTURE:**

Most medical notes follow the SOAP format:

**S - Subjective** (What you told the provider)
**O - Objective** (What the provider observed/measured)
**A - Assessment** (Provider's diagnosis)
**P - Plan** (Treatment plan)

**[ON SCREEN: Real example note]**

**EXAMPLE MEDICAL NOTE:**

**Date:** 15 MAY 2018
**Provider:** CPT Smith, MD
**Location:** TMC, Fort Bragg

**SUBJECTIVE:**
"Patient reports right knee pain for past 3 months, worse with running and jumping. Pain rated 6/10. States pain began after fall during airborne training. Taking ibuprofen with minimal relief."

**OBJECTIVE:**
"Right knee: Mild swelling noted. ROM limited to 110 degrees flexion (normal 135). Pain with palpation of lateral joint line. Negative McMurray test. X-ray ordered."

**ASSESSMENT:**
"Right knee lateral meniscus strain, likely torn meniscus"

**PLAN:**
"1. MRI ordered
2. Profile: No running, no jumping x 30 days
3. Naprosyn 500mg BID
4. PT referral
5. F/U 2 weeks or sooner if worsening"

**[ON SCREEN: What to look for - highlighted]**

**WHAT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THIS NOTE:**

🔍 **"Reports right knee pain"** - Documents your complaint
🔍 **"Began after fall during airborne training"** - In-service event
🔍 **"Likely torn meniscus"** - Diagnosis
🔍 **"Profile: No running, no jumping"** - Duty limitation (shows severity)
🔍 **"PT referral"** - Ongoing treatment

**Every piece of this note helps your claim.**

**[ON SCREEN: ICD codes matter]**

**UNDERSTANDING ICD-10 CODES:**

Medical diagnoses are coded with ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision).

**Examples:**
- **M23.201:** Derangement of unspecified lateral meniscus, right knee
- **M51.36:** Other intervertebral disc degeneration, lumbar region
- **F43.10:** Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified
- **H93.11:** Tinnitus, right ear

**Why codes matter:**

The VA uses these exact codes to rate conditions. If your records show specific ICD-10 codes, it's harder for the VA to deny you have that condition.

**[ON SCREEN: Find these specific codes in records]**

**Look for codes in:**
- Assessment section of notes
- Diagnosis fields
- Billing codes
- Pharmacy records (medications prescribed for specific diagnoses)
- Radiology reports

### PART 4: THE "MAGIC WORDS" IN MEDICAL RECORDS (8:00-11:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "Magic Words" That Win Claims"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Certain phrases in your medical records carry significant weight with VA raters. These are the "magic words" you want to find.

**[ON SCREEN: Magic words list]**

**MAGIC WORDS - CAUSATION:**

✅ "Due to"
✅ "Caused by"
✅ "Result of"
✅ "Secondary to"
✅ "Attributed to"
✅ "Related to"
✅ "In connection with"

**EXAMPLE:**
"Patient's current right knee pain is **due to** meniscus tear sustained during airborne training in 2018."

This single sentence establishes nexus!

**[ON SCREEN: Magic words - Chronic/Ongoing]**

**MAGIC WORDS - CHRONIC/ONGOING:**

✅ "Chronic"
✅ "Persistent"
✅ "Ongoing"
✅ "Recurrent"
✅ "Long-standing"
✅ "History of"

**EXAMPLE:**
"Patient has **chronic** lower back pain **ongoing** since deployment in 2015."

This shows continuity of symptoms from service to present.

**[ON SCREEN: Magic words - Severity]**

**MAGIC WORDS - SEVERITY:**

✅ "Severe"
✅ "Significant"
✅ "Moderate to severe"
✅ "Debilitating"
✅ "Unable to"
✅ "Difficulty with"
✅ "Interferes with"

**EXAMPLE:**
"Patient reports **severe** lower back pain **interfering with** ability to sit for prolonged periods and **unable to** lift more than 20 pounds."

This supports a higher rating percentage.

**[ON SCREEN: Magic words - Functional limitations]**

**MAGIC WORDS - FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS:**

✅ "Limited range of motion"
✅ "Unable to perform"
✅ "Difficulty walking/standing/sitting"
✅ "Requires assistive device"
✅ "Cannot work"
✅ "Unemployable"

**EXAMPLE:**
"Patient demonstrates **limited range of motion** in right shoulder (90 degrees abduction vs normal 180) and is **unable to perform** overhead activities."

This directly correlates to rating criteria.

**[ON SCREEN: Deployment and combat]**

**MAGIC WORDS - DEPLOYMENT/COMBAT:**

✅ "Combat veteran"
✅ "Deployed to [location]"
✅ "Combat-related"
✅ "During deployment"
✅ "Hostile fire"
✅ "IED blast"
✅ "Traumatic event"

**EXAMPLE:**
"Patient is a **combat veteran** who **deployed to Afghanistan** and reports symptoms began after **IED blast** in 2011."

For PTSD and TBI claims, these words are critical.

**[ON SCREEN: Mental health magic words]**

**MAGIC WORDS - MENTAL HEALTH:**

✅ "PTSD"
✅ "Depression"
✅ "Anxiety"
✅ "Suicidal ideation"
✅ "Nightmares"
✅ "Flashbacks"
✅ "Hypervigilance"
✅ "Avoidance"
✅ "Difficulty sleeping"

**EXAMPLE:**
"Patient reports **nightmares** and **flashbacks** related to **combat trauma**, with **difficulty sleeping** and **hypervigilance** in public settings. Diagnosed with **PTSD**."

Every one of these words strengthens a PTSD claim.

### PART 5: WHAT TO DO WHEN RECORDS ARE MISSING OR WRONG (11:00-13:00)

**[ON SCREEN: "When Records Are Incomplete"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
What if your service treatment records don't show an injury you know happened? What if they're incomplete or wrong?

This is common, especially for:
- Combat injuries treated in field
- Injuries you "toughed out" without going to sick call
- Mental health issues you didn't report
- Injuries in deployed locations with limited documentation

**[ON SCREEN: How to fill gaps]**

**SOLUTION 1: BUDDY STATEMENTS**

If your records don't document an event, buddy statements from people who witnessed it can fill the gap.

**Example:**
Your records don't show the vehicle accident where you hit your head, but your squad leader and three team members can write statements describing it.

**We'll cover buddy statements in detail in Lesson 2.3.**

**[ON SCREEN: Solution 2]**

**SOLUTION 2: LAY STATEMENTS (YOUR OWN STATEMENT)**

You can write your own statement describing what happened, when, and how it's affected you since then.

**Example statement:**
"On approximately March 15, 2015, during a convoy mission in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, our vehicle hit an IED. I was thrown forward and hit my head on the vehicle interior. I saw stars and was dazed but did not seek medical treatment at that time because we were still under fire..."

**Your statement is evidence**, even without records.

**[ON SCREEN: Solution 3]**

**SOLUTION 3: SUBMIT CORRECTION TO RECORDS**

If your records contain errors, you can request correction through:

**Army:** Army Review Boards Agency (ARBA)
**Navy/Marines:** Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR)
**Air Force:** Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR)
**Coast Guard:** Coast Guard Board for Correction of Military Records

**Timeline:** 6-18 months (slow process)
**Better option:** Don't wait for corrections - file claim with buddy statements

**[ON SCREEN: Solution 4]**

**SOLUTION 4: UNIT RECORDS**

Sometimes unit-level records contain information not in your personal medical file:

- Line of duty investigations
- Safety incident reports
- Unit logs and journals
- After action reviews
- Medical evacuation reports

Request these separately from National Archives or unit historian if still in contact.

### PART 6: ORGANIZING YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS (13:00-14:30)

**[ON SCREEN: "How to Organize Your STRs"]**

**INSTRUCTOR:**
Once you have your records, you need to organize them so you can find evidence quickly.

**[ON SCREEN: Organization system]**

**RECOMMENDED ORGANIZATION SYSTEM:**

**STEP 1: Create a digital copy**
- Scan all paper records to PDF
- Combine into single PDF (or organized by year)
- Save backup copies in multiple locations

**STEP 2: Create a master spreadsheet**

Track every relevant medical note:

| Date | Provider | Condition | Keywords | Page # |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 05/15/18 | CPT Smith | Right knee | "torn meniscus", "airborne training" | 247 |
| 08/03/18 | PT Jones | Right knee | "chronic pain", "limited ROM" | 289 |

**STEP 3: Highlight and tab important pages**
- Physical color-code by condition (back=yellow, knee=blue, mental health=green)
- Digital: Use annotation tools to highlight magic words

**STEP 4: Create a timeline**

For each condition, create a chronological timeline:

**Right Knee Timeline:**
- 03/10/18: Injury during airborne training (buddy statement, no STR)
- 05/15/18: First sick call visit, diagnosed torn meniscus (STR p.247)
- 06/01/18: MRI confirms meniscal tear (STR p.265)
- 08/03/18: Started PT, chronic pain documented (STR p.289)
- 02/15/19: Still treating, limited ROM (STR p.403)

This timeline becomes your evidence narrative.
