## SCRIPT OUTLINE

**INTRO:** Nexus letters bridge the gap between your current condition and military service - they're often the difference between approval and denial.

**PART 1:** When You Need a Nexus Letter (gaps in treatment, non-obvious connections, secondary conditions, aggravation claims)

**PART 2:** Finding Qualified Doctors (VA doctors, private doctors, IMO specialists, what credentials matter)

**PART 3:** What a Strong Nexus Letter Contains (review of records, examination findings, "at least as likely as not" language, specific reasoning, doctor credentials)

**PART 4:** DBQs Explained (what they are, when VA uses them, how to get private DBQ, pros/cons of submitting your own)

**PART 5:** Working with Doctors (how to ask, what to provide them, red flags, when to get second opinion)

**PART 6:** Cost and ROI (typical costs, payment options, calculating lifetime value, when it's worth the investment)

**CONCLUSION:** A $1,500 nexus letter that increases your rating from 50% to 70% is worth $193,000 over 30 years. It's an investment, not an expense.
