## Student Success Stories

### Master Sergeant (Ret.) Robert Martinez, USA
*Increased from 50% to 100% P&T*

> "I was stuck at 50% for 3 years. This course showed me the secondary conditions I was missing and how to prep for C&P exams. I filed 6 secondary claims and increased to 100% P&T. That's $1,800 more per month for life. This course paid for itself 100x over."

### Chief Petty Officer Lisa Thompson, USN
*Went from 0% to 90% before separation*

> "I thought I was healthy until I took this course. It taught me to review my medical records and identify service-connected conditions. I filed my BDD claim 180 days before separation and got 90% on my first try. $2,241/month tax-free starting the day after I retired."

### Gunnery Sergeant Michael Chen, USMC
*Won appeal after initial denial*

> "The VA denied my back claim - said it wasn't service connected. This course taught me about nexus letters and buddy statements. I filed a supplemental claim with proper evidence and got it approved at 40%. The course basically gave me a $25K/year raise for life."
