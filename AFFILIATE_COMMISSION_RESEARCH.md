## REVENUE PROJECTIONS (Conservative Estimates)

Assuming 1,000 monthly visitors to military transition toolkit:

### Scenario A: Focus on Education (2% conversion)
- 20 Coursera conversions x $30 avg = **$600/month**
- 10 LinkedIn Learning x $40 = **$400/month**
- **Total: $1,000/month**

### Scenario B: Focus on Career Services (3% conversion)
- 30 TopResume conversions x $70 avg = **$2,100/month**
- **Total: $2,100/month**

### Scenario C: Diversified (mixed conversions)
- 10 Coursera x $30 = **$300**
- 5 LinkedIn Learning x $40 = **$200**
- 15 TopResume x $70 = **$1,050**
- 20 USAA leads x $15 avg = **$300**
- 5 ZipRecruiter employer x $80 = **$400**
- **Total: $2,250/month**

### Scenario D: Add VA Claims (1% conversion, if approved)
- Scenario C base = **$2,250**
- 10 VA Claims Insider x $500 estimated = **$5,000** (speculative)
- **Total: $7,250/month** (high uncertainty)

**Note**: Revenue projections assume affiliate program approval and are based on industry-standard conversion rates. Actual results will vary.
